<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would have lived there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American music has been dancing, American authors have been read and run to sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a deep profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of a American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student who had occupied his interest to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I would like to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it's easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number ever met by the Party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigillions person, did I ask myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not defeat Trump and His voters in line with people who I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, receives people from all over the world, a deep glittering man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps is not able to agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also standing in contrast to the great generosity, which I experienced when Sandy Bahr, who also struggles with the environment, and their husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits them to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and wormwood and helped us to accuse us of the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embounded ways to deepen my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While in his way, Trump made its way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans - mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either share its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke out.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to designate the trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To be assigned to people, one of my friends said is exactly what has led to us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnic, who commutes the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like him who looks like him who looks different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(eg.).: as much as" "" "white against all other ethnias" "" "; word game made of white in play on the White and whichash, which means that great Van Jones" "" "did exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America is welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country has chosen twice as his President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the white Americas has this promise, and says: to Hell with manifold, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the United States after 9 / 11, the white man is again at rest, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not so as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a lonely and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump," "" "is not your America." "" "he was corrected 36 hours later." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan could find no more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaic city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played at both places, is not only changing the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is situated on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby preColombian ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) is now playing in the municipality: a symphony orchestra, which has its musical instruments, has the possibility of conquering poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students had become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth had ever offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group seriously, the local news Noticias Oaxaca NVI says:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they race through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle they learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village which is practically on the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in the Russian capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments made from local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio Chavez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double bass, guitar, saxophone, trumpets, trombones, trombones and percussion, all made from garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the starting time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, to contact the parents in garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something which he had never seen before: a pig out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made up of friendly material, which is called the recycling of the Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic Walandfill) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest, as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring play from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork successfully fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that used the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated at the Cuban waters of illegal fishing before it was seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised over accordingly, a little sloped, a law criminals of this type to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comintern, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to raise one of their ports and refusing to share a fishing migrating.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the Prime Minister surrounded by lands that you simply refused everything" "" "remembered Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authorities. it is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and pursued." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protected resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries in 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network in addition to Somalia and Madagascar are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries which are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where there is illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, Head of PheCharge's project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides for FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is not regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to apply for it. illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and ways are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems, which means a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once guarded by bureaucratic hurdles, and through the snow-empirical hurdle, the actions dates back in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news to suspects activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbor spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very thoughtful when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas - such as suspicious driving rouds - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way and perhaps if they have a criminal offs.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships can't sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay from penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there are considerable financial losses for the owners, which means illegal fishing is financially worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterrestrial company which establishes itself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform already mentioned above was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the HISH network each year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate to East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish stocks, absent for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices, actions include like the sailing under false flag, fake licences, indication of imaginations, fish protected species and the fishing in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international collaboration, and" "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say" "" "you didn't want to run my harbour" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and exactly this legale hatch is trying to close FISH Di.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks uncovered, the fake licenses used in Tanzania. there discovered ships, which used several fraudulent identities and found them fleeing ships and found them.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for crimes committed, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations take us quite far into the networks of organizational crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is to help FISH-i to be suspicious in precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">The Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, helps to open up illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst with Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch to an example of their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be geared by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland thus helps to build a system which connects different information panels. it is said to help FISH-i to find a criminal ship with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence influence on the evidently global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of each traceable vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it, who does," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charge" "" "has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities may not only sense crime, but also scare.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships, who previously confiscated without license, and barely had to be reckoned with consequences, know now that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH focused countries now have a 33% increase in fishing sales, selling more licenses since fishing boats.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH had assisted jko 1, Greko 1 invented the inspectors there on board trawls, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries," said Kiilu. "we are a study objective." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will vanish by illegal fishing annually.</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries joined together in 2015, at the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they are now fighting the goal of allowing more such initiatives and structures in other regions." "" "Copeland" "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Just recently, FISH-i's latest member country began to report on his first big triumph in Somalia. in October, there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to use trappies that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also still in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the creation of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go forward to illegal fishing catch," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative workings to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="163">In the context of social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence is the highest in all over the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500%) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the sole way to conquer its institutional structures, and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is a adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a meanwhile grown man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial which ended on 24 August 2016 were committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not feel his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the BÃ¼rde, the same name as his father had to carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He maintained his family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you won't know that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not recognize that my father was a thief, which was a thief and a robber.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmorter officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors who was charged for abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had seen the extent of atrocities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy, and who had said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent of his child and like this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me up to the military base, I often walked with us in the sports hall. there, I had hired me with a boy who made martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later, he showed me a black-and-white photograph and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you have explored you with one of the ERP.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army, the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he gave me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">This was all possible documents: University closures, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, Propagandamateurs, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket of wrap and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were turned and maintained me with a guard posts.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a song that were tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were fixing the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been folded there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They caught a man with handcuffs to the bed, gushed him with water and pursued a load of 220 Volts in the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The smell there was in it... like a dirty windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smelling came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering?</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and were worn at eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian that was also indicted in the process) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people lay with the face down - all were bound by hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the leader of the security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I answered: and you, who groaning on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before anger, struck me and cried,</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me of being a conspiny on this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="300">They could not have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but what their corpses leave?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families, which could be transferred to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the dead is the last abovable act, which you can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was diverse in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was given to the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, who was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun has written:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could things come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for elderly people and in an international city such as KYOTO" "", "said Holmes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was initially removed. the name "Imdrivers" (german: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, if it will not be replaced with the correct name "Elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto prefecture complained for translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already included in the text they had received the translator and that the translation was not checked in their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A loggers reported as follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it is sorry that older people felt inadequate due to inadequate correction (the translation) on our side," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set itself somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denoted as an adequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but the reason for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this represents a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens received 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This means that their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">To transfer two important skills you need: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to use active voice knowledge to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is in the case of motherboards. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language of the motherboards.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this case, a French mother's language should be translated from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies don't employ workers with English as a mother tongue, to make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers who would have to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, but they have translations delivered by their English knowledge. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best one, to translators - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machelle translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and selective propositions which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique is still not able to replace a human translator for a long time. this is valid for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English patterns in Japan, including those traded prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stible reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable, or at least harmless. however, by large enterprises or from the government that have the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto takes care of a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one denotes the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a big family with little money over her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned in this case is that the children can afford to work countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be lifted as part of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In this case, she said with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness announcements and denounced them.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to call the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Criaditas, guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who hold their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society, and can make something out of itself, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that receives the girls and whose exploitation with the faith justifies that they would give someone a chance, otherwise no training would be, and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira surrendered to MarÃ­n, until she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment of the young girl's life.</seg>

<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Cdevcuela did the deep in the Paraguayischen society of the Criadazgo's practice for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest comments and demanded that there will be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, among whom conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid study of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison by TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo.</seg>

<seg id="462">She stood at 5 o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example cleaned the refrigerator, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and the infected soil.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she was never starving, but got not unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the Library of the master's library as food from the fridge," she reminds me.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the master's master, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some end of the end, the master of the house of Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and to read the position of opposition flights such as "Sendero or" El Pueblo. "</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them to grant no faith to the reports of the official media on the regime's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept them intelligently for intelligent, but did not entertain to her. "the master of the house had found someone who talked about politics as he spoke about politics."</seg>
<seg id="472">"they were not often allowed to visit my family, because they were the opinion that I would learn there again" bad Anhabits. "so they supposed that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, at home again their mother tongue Guarani would speak.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared because they were the formation they had enabled them to lose again, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was, however, entirely clear that she had paid for everything she was paid with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga was discriminated. "a thing that is almost never spoken, are mobbing and the chicans who are exposed to Criaditas if they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have their parents, they immediately acknowledge that someone who has no parents, has a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't leave anyone at home. I didn't have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">Isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed to "agreed to" Regulation concerning the regulatory and commercial social networks. "</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is accepted by Parliament, users must register users of social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be established that is contracted to share civil servants and citizens to share social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users would have to register users on the site of the site with their real names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it will be missed, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and Youz7 and Egypt are Independent, defines social media as "jedor application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video editing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law enact when it is accepted, since the draft does not give reference to how Egyptian authorities are supposed to raise the user's users, not to register before the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of the legislative and promoter of the law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name, and a password to come by the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to create a firewall on the national level around the Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for the Egyptian and Egyptian, to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known to date that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts from local experts are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "General Research Institute") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), declared Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, this means that they will be a strong monitoring system to filtrate citizens who apply for homologation or not. and this means a crazy system to supervise the activities of the people, and also to put it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">Technically, this is not a realistic yet - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft on the legislatures of Parliament and the Constitutional committees must be discussed before it comes to the plenary session." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military thought in parliament, in which sense will be maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the image surface is present," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video, "Persian leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually can be seen in the wild bobsleigh track and goes to zero. as the team in the video therefore set that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza, breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School to Shizugwa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still active in the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, which had been achieved in the last six years, had been affected by the "threeased disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a prefecprefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had vanished all coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, because of this reason alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo report shows a local point of view which was reached six years later in order to reconstruct the life of local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re-regulatory authority as well as the survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (which is to be brought back in, saigai kouei juutaku) in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures were registered Miyagi, and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas in Fukushima, with 70 percent its final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Although still, six years after the disaster, evacuees from Behbfsempties have been trying to deal in final spare-homes for six years, even six years after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-way catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in Notwithstanding, whereas Miyagi was successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuates were transferred to the disaster in containers of homes, were transferred to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Ivata, this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The work and daily life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Just as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, its doors up to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">Almost 100 percent of fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation again in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fisheries have resumed their operations.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have suffered great importance.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmland from Fukushima in the "nuclear rezone" zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered well again, but also Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand as opposed to the disaster. Fukushima still weighs 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper conducted numerous fragmentation under the native population and among the evacuated people. she asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake of the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the position of evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture also had a witness for the worst, catastrophenols, atomic fact that had to be experienced in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were evacuated outside the prefecture of Fukushima near Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima in early 2016.</seg>
<seg id="580">Still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home-prefecture in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees still occur in containers, are over 50 years old. they were able to compete for reconstruction efforts of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">The introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso completed nearly hundreds of sugar tube factories in the whole of Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill, regardless of what there is no noteworthy sugar-on-site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar tube factory.</seg>
<seg id="629">After getting there, the sugar tube industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Another autographed and commute every day to the factories that are grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran that rises every day at 4: 00am, the crisis in the sugar tube industry did not take away his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugars factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after long inactive time because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something that he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers very clearly that in MaÃ±ali would get the sugar tube factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tube industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, Ineffiti, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">By 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news about a few decades ago would have been a motive for the country, but the bad awakening are not yet any more new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar tube industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the village has already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically sedated, and hardly competitive, they were unbeatable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production ratio was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugars for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the crisis rise in the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar have to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report of "agricultural proletariat" by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the sugar cane would generate at about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day with security in history," this was the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the breastfeeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents say the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters started to emerge in front of the first time.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recognized by the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulam Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any removal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the specified factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar-owned sugar-tube factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for the retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the disclosure of the factory, where the construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, which he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in all of Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do the job with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014 workshop uses mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by pedagogy David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North American with ten cree-communities and then with Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop means that the young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever makes them sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of school "Na Aksa Gyilak" Yoo in the territory of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, even "highway of tears," in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemesis Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influences is due to globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagi Cree First Nation is recorded, the refrain is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youth involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a Stanza in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are exposed to the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (that is to be taken away, "Plastic Models of the dishes") from any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi, there is a variety of these small companies that produce the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga about 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually found that they do not even show them more. a new trend is transformed, however, in conspicuous cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the Blogitinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic dishes, decorated cell tapes, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitten collection objects like in this case, refrigerate.</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of Shokuhin fridges for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders will become increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this three-square bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we manufactured for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to view like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing landing.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, icura and salmon have been used, a popular topping with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">If there is someone who said: "Wow, cool, now I can chipping my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appetite-like shape to surprise people or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melmelon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, we also have rice balls (onigiri), earrings and bands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whichile plastic dishes you can see yourself under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the 's' s' s' on Twitter The Hashtag # '.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to find out more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you insight into the Kappabashi district, who is devoted to the Beliefering of the restaurant industry. like for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media over the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mixes and killed regularly occur in statistics. however, this mirror did not reflect on the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle is bringing with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the boss of the Sinaloa carton, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the sadness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone of bones in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners who may never heal their wounds.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican News portal Animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learn a voice) with the drug trafficking, and stories of people who were fighting between prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers and will need to drive all the municipalities so many kilometers to buy something as low as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (german: "how anxiety life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father's sister, her four brothers and sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priest:" "" "as every Sunday, we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put to us, and go to the graves after the men who have loved us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, there is no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it does not get paid out because that ask for a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Apruna vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only need to show the faces of those who fear fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the State guidance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on readers of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with the disease and sensing journalism now for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover page with pictures which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or the files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who is rayed or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be conspicuous, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great (German: drug retailer) if it is big. and it's not normal for people to hear about the "heroism" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what they would have lost those who have lost somebody and those who have fear to them so something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The human elessness of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were "sowed."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to agree that they are spared from such tragedies, unless they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months" pressing in the main city districts. "she describes how armed crime happened for month's money from their business, until she was not only destroyed the business, but also her family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost, and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain will never die, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if there is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they can withdraw you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if you want to dissolve my deep root emotions, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the entry "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of the hand-made generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he asks questions on how: who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to rise up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity, and he tells himself that he had to teach himself, how to make a egg, potatoes, tortillas, make tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the flake with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg, one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for which the whole life is made of violence and learning to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father had been shot by armed men from a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence through the organized crime and the struggle against them had been mixed with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Federal Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecution declared 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of getting new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we don't forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 launched the data journalism project, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking in the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is this year after something that has emerged for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether it is true or untrue, to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to execute misleading, tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false meaning of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions to our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicking and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war of Africa's second largest country was neglected and thus devastated, the streets in the region had become dangerous ploughs that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fire ball, dozens of dozens, including a cinema in the vicinity, which was full of people who clearly explained the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">The houses of crumbled and looted bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to impediment.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "one image with the title" "" "That is Nigeria." "" "by Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body, which are excited on the ground for people to watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was quenched several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but was unable to impose real-related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian settlements Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay down in streets and prayers.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed but no one remained back to count bodies, "said one of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were smashed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time only was shown on the basis of satellite imagery.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely regarded as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abbrevity of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of errors; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further bring forth personal comments as this example, as an example from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange joined forces with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in appearance.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcements, published by the United Nations, those who could flee blows, rape and several dead, some caused by failing.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by violence against the Rohingya, patrons, such as the following, made these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from an acidi-Arab News page, which in 2012 claimed that President Myanmars Thein has said that monks and politicians would have been involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to shoot this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original entry, which was last accessed on April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, AFP and source, had also called Than Being this statement, but had not thus brought the picture from DR Congo in connection to them.</seg>
<seg id="859">The wide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these wrong coupling clamps reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse image search" you can see how far more information can exceed borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixture of private sites, platforms of social media and common publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed false reports, and others have tried to lared the counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have soaked examples of the abuse use and associated with the respective countries, based on which page they have been published. thus, we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the listed countries (which in some cases also interconnected with each other), several examples are to be used for misuse use.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abbrevity of the picture from DR Congo, with one part of a tweet, sympathy against the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand of a blogist, the allegations, the Rohingya have been persecuted, since the photos were used to misuse.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The government of Myanmar published a right position as "deliberately faked news and photos, international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstanding in terms of Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This correct position, which is published exclusively on English, also includes references to fake pictures of rumours that are used by Hate Speech and are used by extremist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Buddhists and the other (which is often disseminated by burmese nationalists).</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page was falsely claiming that the President of Myanmar Than has been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release, the picture remains in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 concerning students who had been murdered by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic Church site AnÃ¡lisis Digital, expressly stated that the picture was not written by the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar" hairy attack. "</seg>
<seg id="913">When the Picture of the Boko Haram massacre was put into circulation in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to prove that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yory" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and disbanded a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 and the connection to Charlie Hebdo in Paris in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took part in these events that took place in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times), but the messages that were associated with it were not taken in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was supposedly written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" over the Nigerian massacre was put into circulation, there were discussion forums such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the Counterfeit message.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the Embassy in which the BILD of the DRC was included, the organisation of the Claretine Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos were submitted.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">In other accounts, aggregation and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), the inks are also not completely retraceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / data sheet exist on the web crawler and if they have image files related to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only after the original accident of 2010, the picture finally carries a correct description, but the original fee is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that pierces these posts. the first frame focus on Religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in terms of larger discussions regarding silence in the relationship with the killings of Christians or - for the defence of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing has used the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion wants to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth watching how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if the readers of these pictures can no longer be trusted.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are few people who are unintentional to practise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests that the mood of the false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the refusal of refusing images to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that violent images and audience dissizing them and take the ability to empathy Empempathy (such as this study, who examined how violent media act on it, others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are a lot regarding non-violent representations in the media media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technical experimenting experimented with algorithms in order to support the fight against "Fake News." they will thoroughly think about situation, in which a picture can be suggested, but what actually can be used from context or in completely missive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any examination of false reversal should also be considered as international as they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. infiducible) is trying to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others who are rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sooresa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard times every try of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, for example is a full explanation, and sometimes something that is needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected in an online list for a whole time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguis by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example, words from the Greek language of Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Dismiss your parents in recognition of what you have tried in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik Language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or sloth that you feel after being washed in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words out of his blog above:</seg>
<seg id="956">They shook other cultures, unveil other ideas and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the Linguists on this page you want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be one way, here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird, the unreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is a try to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the framework of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided, if we create cities, receive gasousness - safe spaces, in which residents do not have to forget who they are to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening to this is often associated to understand" "" "these events instead," "" "to perceive, to feel, to build, make it up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historians write their story at first in their own language and translate or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if participants are not a professional history count, their devotion and their account will result in ensuring that the audiences can be touched upon it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this turn, the Dassidator Rassidatou Conate also takes the opportunity to explain the story of typical art-robbers for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel from the hares and the Pavian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of its Fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide Grinlet it divides his feeling of the wise:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of the Treasure Language storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all that are inspired by the project can take into contact with TLS to organise their own skills.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico demands new debt reduction from the USA</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new examination for the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the puertorpedan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called by the group "Frente Ciudadano de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the neural examination of the liabilities) and the Ãcomenical Church of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the new debts of the debt, also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos calls that politicians, banks and government authorities, who are responsible for the debt, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial inspection and a tap committee without personal interests to the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions, the remuneration that is agiert in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to get rid of the pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the territory of the United States - is suffering under a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">So, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a pro-independent non-profit organization without Party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state recognition.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rican requires a major restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed by the outside are not subject to the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger, to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration took the name "Nachtwache for Light and Light."</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, published in the last year and is available free here, contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Basle and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to elaborate like motions for free knowledge, and what the true expenses are, with which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and authors who are involved in the movements of free knowledge, have worked on site to watch over the fog, who gives our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and popular Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or position of stay.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of his book gives his friends and his family a voice to push back his release and that they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the Webdeveloper of Open Source and Digital Activist has been in Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police based Bassel had taken along the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, when the Assad government insisted and informed them by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and to extend the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical scientist and currently overlooked the director of New Palmyra, a project which founded Basle, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Not one of Basslike cultural prototypes didn't work more than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually test the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the sign of numerous civilizations and here are merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would set aside all these architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike train into the digital archeology and the conservation has created a time capacitor which will be the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet stopped this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, to dream of liberty and taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English with him, even when he was already detained in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he has taught other prisoners to read English, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He gave me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has taught other prisoners as they use computer, at least in theory, without having held a lot in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In addition, Ghazi is the author of Waiting (Waiting for Waiting), which she wrote in 2012 until 2015, when he found himself in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They clashed the texts to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Syrian Arab.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Bookend of Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens with every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sincerely in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind at the moment in which we embrace the poor,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every one of the dangers does not matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, grets and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the time of the prison.</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I penetrate into every detail of your voice, and words;</seg>
<seg id="1235">Whom I bear with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes fail to say</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I'll make another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I immediately return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And over your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bass story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) since the beginning of the protests in 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people will remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We are repeating our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption, director at the provisional release returned to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger to a corruption, in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence against the corruption in which the corruption has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 54 million metial (some 800 000 euros) for 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately requested his readjustment to the company, which was done on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Attorney General, there wouldn't be an obstacle to Cambaza, once again to refer to his old post, since the company had not performed disciplines after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not call the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The center for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), an local institution that establishes itself for public transparency, in an interview with the German Wave, the decision of the company to reprove the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the struggle against corruption, and makes it clear the lack of transparency and even a setback to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we know is that the company should have one disciplinary procedure against the contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company remained silent, however, and caused no reasonable steps to use the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior as "contradicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, it would be advisable after having been sentenced to a prison term, and half of them served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and be his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has decided to reintegrate into the company, which he helped to hurt damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his sweat.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Conflicting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded from the state, because he rewarded him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded to such a way that has already massively in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has been operated only by the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handsome of the inexhaustive money source and the state itself is tired of that man, who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, who will not only remain as the first independent President, but also as a sharp, one-cutter and by the same way - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous renderings, when he was energetic, affirmed that "an ambitious man is ready to be able to sell the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn off his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also denied:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, but he was 10 years old and was released.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means kidiorse or spage bots.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the net because they liked the word "Kalar'abstained.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general as adjectively "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in burnish script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hassene in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abstaining connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is usually used by ultra-nationalists as Hasselt against Muslims, who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight against me in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism in conjunction with racism, but the word on itself is not endowed in Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of the word have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burse words with basic different meanings, which have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (winding), 'Kalar Oat' (Camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboohue Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends for a spiritual way, whether they were waging, how he could relieve his back pain by making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questioning (la) on Burmeso - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they lessen the language of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the poets that destruct racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatic ism is not able to understand what you write on a factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should make, is the post carefully analyse and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spage bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three nationalist nationalists, that Hasselt the language, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action will send a strong signal to all, the effectiveness of this strategy may not cause long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of buzz is often a catch- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply going to start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored speech to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his postings when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was interested in this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post by Facebook was removed and the liken, post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours, because the post "The Facebook community standards did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a great variety of postings from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions against Hasselt radicous nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with hate:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author presented his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are poor in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine has believed that Facebook would have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmical Internet community to question advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words are to be censored only by hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started to have this without local context or technical support, and such words as "chair" or "Gensencurry" have been prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they made a mistake, they did not attempt to report falsibly deleted platforms.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is ensured for a lot of fun among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than taking it seriously, users are now doing fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassh to see if its posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook posthosts, which were not abstained in Hasselt, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmc text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and watching an inheritance of pecurcurry and a Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the Post, which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post states "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt is to stimulate violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been for his interrogation, who were aware of an assassination attempt on his burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of shaving the word 'Kalar', it would have better current, more likely to move forward in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of a couple of members, some members of religious groups held their religious groups in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harryperora Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, met that the state should not intervene in the state as that, at age not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago had a contract partner of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, defined by minors, every person under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago to 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Ministry of Statistics confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavour to abolish laws for children before, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns, to say the critics of the children of children, they ought to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition seemed difficult for tension in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts that the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now, only the President of the country must agree and declare the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators were reposted on Facebook a status update, which has re-posted by Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against children's before was decided at a House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once he had decided in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was thrilled because the laws were changed for children before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a ministerial ministerial council in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has a lot of time and unnecessary smell, which has veiled the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children before it is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson made my opinion, it was definitely taken long enough to prevent the practice, Lara Quentall-Thomas was finally convinced that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentren- Thomas, which says:, Herafrading News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The couple has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">On the following, the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD) belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), which was quite openly about the passage of the law noted, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago is now regardless of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment of the Ehegesetzes was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives, and 35 of them were present in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MPs, who were contrary to the law, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's children are not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>

<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of Sanhatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake a judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to fulfil his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, it is quite right if Maharaj was against the law wished, most social media users wish to wish to change the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed to:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about the discussion as generally speaking, in a way that we would invite the state into our bedroom, "that it may protect the state that it may benefit from big, hard-driven men who are opposed to them in an advantage," would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the childrens are legal or remains the norm, although there is laws which they understated.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the locking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used to use reversing tools for block websites (a recent article by the New York Times also reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN reward in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia are not allowed in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Even though Turkey has been working on Wikipedia articles from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regular blockades of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship by Wikipedia." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several mirrors are now (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform stopped all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentered peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set it all to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the contents of decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content, even if you can't reach the site www.wikipede org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also showed that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and there are only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikianziong.org, a Mirror page of Wikipedia, when also WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mirror websites when on Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One takes on another URL, which is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied. they were blurred with badly, motiven and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivate himself motivate him to carry and try to start the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time, he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptas, strives to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as he helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world nature heritage. what could it give better for a passionate wild animal photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested at home just when suddenly in Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Ghanlodge), he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to gnashing pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to collaborate with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepals nature and like to deepen the understanding of it that wild animals are not so frightening how they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was standing by face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not interfere with the opinion of sheep in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was too, because of darkness, on the way to home, when suddenly the King of Buzzks appeared. he immediately appeals to us and he starred me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for Environmental Protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">For 22 days he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take home in Bardia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days it took a photographer and took six to seven days for the perfect photography of birds, which live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was released here as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, to pronounce the name of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a ronomist or say "My father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhadisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure and the fear of the consequences they should have regard the norm to maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by an Indian state Olive a by a headlight and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a secret relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of marriage women is not common in the name, is also common among men. however, they do have much less assignments to fear, if any, they should not come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals as well as housewives, a unique club and became the main focus of the city quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the fine details of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is powered by the community of Volunteers and establishes itself for the disassembly of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years on the discovery of practitioners, as children's marriage up to the associations of HIV- and AIDS Indians, and directs this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how this clubs formed a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the time of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, showing the Rohini in its discussion group, did not have women who call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided on this topic, because they wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem that the women could identify themselves easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Do not hesitate to issue the name of their husbands, is an again responsible for whom they have found guilty, and never questioned him.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who is not holding this will be regarded as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made ourselves up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, had never called the name so far, try out at home how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in mother and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was too late.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call him concerning his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Baggage, Rohini started her first discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members would be a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, scandalized, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked them all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, that they will not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to visit the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Break of a century of ancient tradition, in which women married to the name of their husbands never.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise there was only a prostrate; a others decided to leave the entire frustrative frustration against him and his family, by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on its faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenaline intoxication, having broken down with an old brilliance, the women decided that they actually try to call home their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she put in the head, his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law she stared her, she was afraid, and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said," "" "I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of one participant in a course was less understandable and the situation involved in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of a red-red point on the forehead, pointing to the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the galvanized red point, if he did it daily.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I listened to him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose even if not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we'll make a trip on every discussion of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to worry about women who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; they danced and sang talking about things they had never had imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I have also known about some things, for example how our identities have been knotted to our husbands, as never said to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell some things loud, no matter how small they occur one.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, it is okay, but some wanted a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Following a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, mugly Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Upper inhibiting) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan an excursion to Goa, where they can bear Jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps to date.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, enclosed me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the noise of more freedom of movement or its own clothes-election - will be the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, it will realize that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club, each one of us, gives us the confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when any woman goes home to home and other people, what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on July 8, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo moved attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to cancer of cancer at the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (State of State) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China has referred to Liko's case as "an internal matter," and he tells a spokesperson he did it as "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel prize laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, release it or give him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, some are completely removed from the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">S Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesperson refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate liu abroad for a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">The Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to replenish the salmon to China, as the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee made his hope for an unconditional release to the expression and invited Liu to pick his award in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The European diplomat of the EU, Federica mogherini, has also called for the release of Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">In the same time, we anticipate that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branch dealt with that the Americans said to him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, as far as it is helpful to him in his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in China's Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was asking for the Chinese authorities not only to leave Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US Embassy moved to an angry response from China to itself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "there is no country the right to interfere with and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the following follicas:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel and access to the medical care of his choice, based on which they have entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senate, Marco Rubio, Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz, also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German Government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "gets all the medical support he needed" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing's News Agency announced that China had great concerns, whether the vortex could be surpassed by Liu to visit Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called to provide an adequate medical care to the opportunity, giving him the opportunity to provide himself with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney previously told that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always has the room monitored in the hospital, and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to agree on its international human rights, including freedom of expression, the freedom of expression and the rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called for China in a declaration on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he needs, regardless where, are needed. furthermore, his wife and family may contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Even though the news channel France Info reported that the French government would welcome the Liu state in the country, there was no further information given to whether France would take it out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Liu and deploying a larger tolerance compared to those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">In Taiwan, the Taiwanese legislator reported to allow China to allow the sick intellectual liu to allow the sick intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June at Liu, and announced that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished, have led to a harmonious, sturdier and prosperous China, which once again contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and legal status in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International Office of the State of New York, the minister noticed that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, as they were compared to Singapore in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He undergoes that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog of Cavalierio accuse the Minister of Justice to overthrow the logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and benefits offered to create this valuable land, you will say that we will be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmuamalgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of what he appeared uneven non-democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York. these cities, who are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre of authoritarian feaers, which give them Democrats, leave the distorted logic, as they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmuamalgam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our poldicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">The corresponding questions he cloaked with non-answers rational style.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng invites you to show his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take care of this point, as far as it was paid high, in order to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By launching on the blog his comment, he insisted on the reviews that it should begin to understand the entire press copy of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore be so uneven though we are looking forward to free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He promised Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes up a growing generation, such as this polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I'm not sure he believes, really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dismantling the weak spots of Shanchogams objections:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmuamalgam has committed a bug, or was there a publisher?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we will be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally the country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role in the government cabling, the statements of Mr. Shanbrave are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>

<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, which is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is guided by a 59- year old Mexican, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">The name is ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather she itself) became a goal for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - still hundreds of African and haired migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people come to a full small bus and off the upper part of the coast you start to call:" "" "mom Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">It's rather quiet at the time, but during this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on board boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them, and brings them to the hospital if she is sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot be paid, they massage with a balm that exhausts one of the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to get there their husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a normal stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other descendants of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "Felix Michelet, a guest of Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Afrikaner is often travelling together the route and that Afrikaner is able to speak to Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the book ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact RamÃ­rez's future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never go again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells you that their guests will often send text messages when they are gone to grate them or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparks hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jessica's Valencian.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family settled in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is Policit and has found that the buckets of buckets are sold to a number of African migrant workers.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them, get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a cooking outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencian explained that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to press money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, one-one-one, has offered him roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family dwells still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">During the course you can consult the travellers through their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy about it that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she cries in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair folklore, which you made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travellers, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users is to be removed from the floor.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In this message, the app is said to have access to terrorist information from it. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities must use the app for more than the fight of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh Women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, the app could determine the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service provider with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and Phishing pages to make users invent how much time they spend online, and to remote control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "remote actors or even hackers may capable to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While about digital censorship in China are usually focused on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is quite often gloomy for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme interest rates and surveillance measures and routinely web circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet "images from Mainland China" (to be brought back), the censored news in China showed photos of a Checkpoint where policemen were logged properly then whether it had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're working on a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">That is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">That is a form of captivity by the control technology.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computer and cell phones in Xinjiang are used to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town council to minimize the prevalence of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branch, authorities and with the party-related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an US American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a decree entitled to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, cellphones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rappers Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free opinion of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallat Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib verts the majority of its time inside. he sileneth on his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers, or his nicotine lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year that Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fellowyeen (around: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and asks its altitudes of gender, sexuality and free opinion of expression by art and raping music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that focuses on topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian geographer, he calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these themes do not only find in his home town Amman Relevance, but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib himself sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind through limits, and he can feel with people living under the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not open it openly, he turns against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looked at his art in a studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything that was born with his identity as "Palestinian Geometry of the second generation" - so he called himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life uprisings," Hdaib was stressed out.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he is dissolved in water, the holy month of Ramadan. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib made a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions, and on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the muzzle is warm coffee and the sweat of the kent cigarette in the nose in the first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From hence, it is easy to do fundamental things - as to the public during Ramadan to drink water, not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary institutions that support the Islamic Action Plan - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier in Hamed Sinno, contrary to the cultural and traditional standards of the country, speaks and the main reason for the concert passage.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled" "" "because of sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, who provides the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila valued the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which still decided to use "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably is probably not easy to be silken rhetoric, but actually clearly reflected in the crystal clear reality in Jordan, which clearly becomes clear in Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib stirred traditional sex ormen to body by having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a evidently unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Honor' of Honor 'has risen in Jordan - the unofficial one.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor in 2016 reached its climax. however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the Crime of Crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of their family-familial violence, "and for their liberation, often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music is well pleased with great popularity and is well-known to reject the topics, which in his country long as tabu gold.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, is a dream that he can not split his music, which is full of exportations on sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He was dealt with politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib took over the question of the Palestinian Identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" there is a focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically distinct in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song he repeated a verse times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want, "- be Faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still greatly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, in order to remember that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored according to his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but he was only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals does not respond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuas, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuas was supposed to work once again on the order of the caliph in the eighth century, why could Jordan did not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Semitic Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government imposed attacks on the free opinion of expression and the progressive colonization was brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news services adopted several former government officials and members of the teaching forces, arguing that they were critical in the commentary in social media about the problems related to corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs concert is therefore only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Projorou 'Leila is now relying for him for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks from slow, reasoned and inner changes. it is sure that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib was dreaming, as millions of other Arabs also, of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of it, his work, to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them" "" "experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be annulled with music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness, and not through bombs, streetitions and artificial kind, the democracies. at least he is hoping for this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib is going to continue until it is far, and it is also possible to resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to the student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories on the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also recorded in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing over a thousand years were recorded in the armies from west Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true, and yet another amazing way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of an 18-metre-high ballroom was amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, the outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history, as they help keep the Peruvian youth from crime, and promote a legitimate profession as to promote the hairdresser's hair.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of the region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru is experienced as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairdressers of famous sports such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to attract more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can formulate them.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the utmost borders of fantasy and creativity, even an annual event inspired by the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which takes place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other to show how you can see the most accurate scopes as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitors can be found on the public Facebook-profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as School Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people for their weapons of hairstyling tools and instead of poor advice given to them to find jobs.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offering possibilities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school was offered to special training workshops in March beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of being of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the message "Liebesbidden to guerrilla fighters," published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who are eased out to oppose affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists from the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Letters for Reconciliation), the young people encouraged and write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International applied the signatories of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, the Colombian is still a long way until one can speak of a real propitiation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who had been living in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock, their weapons have to be integrated in life as a civilian.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, which accuses to life in constant fear and in some cases, had accustomed toward guerrilla fighters, must now hold them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian ships came together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly the same: until now thousands of young people have written letters - lovers of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighters - that should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which was held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash satyarti in 2014, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people that we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's day, but those who need them need much more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He left, he told us to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never thought that someone would be forgiven. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN stock in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC met so on how they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of substitution of people from the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings could walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between in between," says the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this memorable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we delivered the letters, a former fighter led me to the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Camcode" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the village nap.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "nevertheless I asked him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life someone has written to me so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "I suddenly ran the tears of cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was feeling the war, and was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a fighter, and willing to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as war. the FARC joined the FARC, was the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I would have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, which is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned to learn how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a prelude, students and some of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insights into their views about the peace process. "for many years we experienced the opportunity of developing ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who have never found hearing, and had no right to vote, and to know that people that I often have seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned upside by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, in which the country lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - also those who have been killed and so much harm caused to bring us something, and can give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote for instance DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been declared that peace would reign after the deforestation of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons to rise and to protest for their rights. and this is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now use the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the Defender of Peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong to - above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, our contribution to our contribution, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. to those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2260">Thereafter the photos of my documents made by the whole of Whatsapp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was there, I heard a couple of shopping blocks from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice say, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt something in my body, but did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another phrase, but this time on the Chechen: "how long will you honour the family, do you cry?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had got along everything and began to shout.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I ventured two jelling in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case report you were laid - in which the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name; but the doctor understood and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">To this end, I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats threats threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote me, saying, Strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They reported lack of claims: some said I had to prove it by moving up without the streets; others wanted me to show at the official TV in Grozny and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just locks, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have gradient size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic has disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must vanish from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and put a snares for his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">And the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later the window stood by a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 down.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I was clear that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My hands of human rights checked the numbering plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the land, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without having to register, without a reference, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you are in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">You know, our people know, in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sex. however, this is a tending topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">I also wish to be able to overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really give my effort to see how the person remembers, that they remember out of their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who are dorded?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who lost one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">To this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these worry about the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so-called "honor" through blood is experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men recorded in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those who have no rich relatives or left the relatives of their relatives, to put the Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present it as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but targeted to radiate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only an idea or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm going to be imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was involved, when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not introduced as a band until now, there were no reports to date. however, we discouraged that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave it?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have already been held in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair forever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Caria was seen, I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intended to lead us to" "" "civil society" "", "but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had painted eyelashes, wore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Interior Ministry of the Scharia never has a hair bent to me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">There is a phrase in the Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say to children, if they make funny fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so you simply have sealed their eyes before you because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long does this grace mean?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking about moral television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but primarily as the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how human beings began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had seen and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worshiped.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I won't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I am communicating with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreffs, togethersoever, I pay them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not suffered a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I abapperched myself.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am musky and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is the best.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Such is nature, that has indeed nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you know with foam in front of the mouth, there is no gay there for them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan who, the Kabardiner, have the Russians, who have the Russians too, but in the whole planet it gives them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about Transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trusting.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exact, different food settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner, or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all about it - I just know that I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warns an increase of self-murder within the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">An unusually high unemployment rate and poverty in the native Arab population suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there is a strong increase in self-mornings.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arabian Workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with approval.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 moved the despair situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Morovi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the ancestor in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he shallowable for his own helplessness to come up for his family, such as Ahwazi rights groups that work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video set on YouTube, holding the moments when he had set up himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to erase the flames, and Morovi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerators were so strong that doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who created in August within the Arab Ahrazi-minority, and activates the activists that could take the lives of more men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and Shaked Bani Tamim - have logged in.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-fathers, who felt themselves because of persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and to work in a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community lived in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to denounce its life's life.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz became a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took over 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahvz Region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful spaces for the Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disorders, hunger and expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the ancestors of the Ahwazi-Arabians in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of demns, the waters of Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, felman and ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy devastation in the region by drying, and destroy local agriculture as well as fisheries and palms.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab groves has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian-president, for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are seeking a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a further school and have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, declared Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and cultural ethnic discrimination," said to a "high rise" in the number of self-murder among young Ahwazi males.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become more than worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ahwaz, anew with anti-Arabic discrimination and anti-Arab discrimination in the adjusting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are not prefers to set up Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be able to access the job opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regimes that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force them to earn their habit out of their home ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be positioned, because Arab names cannot be tolerated at the workplace, because speaking the speaking of Arabic language or the tragedy of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that need to endure the Arab Ahrazi, the human rights activist alarm, before the situation exploded.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I unidentists me with the feminism, also with the interruption not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide li and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read reviews in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as interactive feminists call - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are surprised, why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally ought to be feminist * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under severe observation if it is about what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensured that women earlier, or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am persuaded about it and I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from Diaspora; if I mention, what kind of being physically and verbal, both in and beyond feminist movement, caused many white feminists and white intersecular feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to gather "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing," to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutional form of motivating violence, which we exposed black women to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnias and liberals were less deserve than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spas and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all males and all men every person, neither skin colour the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman to consider to consider the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, that relate to both the gender as well as on the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and I'm not going to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">According to their speech, Sojourner complained in her speech: "I am not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a decidedly and marginalised nature in the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program in order to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to define white women the importance of the cutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women to the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honour them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">"" "although the intersecular feminism was founded in order to borrow women between different approach and limits to the white feminism, still the word" "" "feminism" "" "in his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to join me and completely join the feminism movement and join me to the movement of Womanism, who has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so hard to use for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so hard that interferality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women after our own ideas and take us into the spouses that we have created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clara Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana blurism: how to conquer ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how to define ourselves by ourselves). and not only that - black women may also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the spiritual, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interactive feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a bluristic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, because I have existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a field, in which my life was neither covered, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most of the names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commander said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said, their testimony would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena showed a lack of mistreatment, the Ada BÃ¡ez was useful as well.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman went back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women receive at all once, they do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also depend on the men who abuse themselves. this also explains why only 20% of all women to admit to the victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

"there are different information and reports that show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General prosecutor dropped 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences are actually displayed. "on every woman who will not be screened in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on every woman who are reimbursed for physical abuse, there are two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay was not a separate criminal, the law enforcement authorities may not be adequately documented how many women will be murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days, a woman dies due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not accept anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she really wanted to do that, but she was supposed to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years she had the psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable at most difficult:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would have never thought that I would have been offering victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that the only women who are subcontracted, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to convey that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana to ask why she had liked so long of Carlos and did not leave it before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least had a certain contributor to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which dates back to Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner had mistreated it.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all living in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of the women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She carried out a trial against its former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native land, where it was mainly owned by money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"there are many laws in Paraguay, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the abuse of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Eauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems at the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks to explain Femizid into an independent sentence and harder to punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, in some points, the legislative text was changed in some points, so that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions are ruled that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to take place most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process to carry out the victims of violence itself, if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation, to state the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Ikhri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature does not provide a sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interhuman relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A reunion needs to take place here, so that violence is no longer considered a while.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever keeps silent in view of these facts, makes a debtor and helps to escape the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse such a long report, until mistreatment is not considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was passed in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, there was a passage that the partners had been calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions of the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The passage concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," political violence, "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# softer), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most of the names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2545">An independent media continues in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information" "" "is on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the Venetian authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of her reporting on corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues in prison, where he is serving a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were arrested and placed before the court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman is ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had taken his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state of State.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans of the Sultans are marked by the bewilful efforts of security forces, especially of domestic secretion, free freedom of freedom, including freedom of freedom, to unify and detained human rights, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hinders citizens, also activists, remember to express their views on the country's public matters, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closing and imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) since its inception in 2007, until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief of Azamn, filed an article entitled "High Priority Parties" of the judiciary, which was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016. it was corruption and the mixture of high-ranking officials in the judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri was invited to join the Department of Staff of the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival from the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS-Haj Deputy editor of the editor of Yousef Al-Haj, taking into the editor of Al-Maamaris, accepted as Chief Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on indefinite period after the information minister had given the instruction that "the publication and distribution of the paper on every way, including online, starting August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial in Maskat took place the first trial in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both found among other things because of the disorder of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "digitiation of the Prevention of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of a public ban and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year career was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having used the use of a Information Network to disseminate material that could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">Al-Abri was fixed a deposit of 5000 omanic Rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Judgment from prison.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, the Appeals Court acquitted al-Abri acquitted on 26 December 2016, and Al-Haj condemned to one year and Al-Maamari sentenced to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision made by the court, Azamn again, the newspaper was exposed to attacks by the Korean government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement which was extended by the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Information Secretary personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister had another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to return the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist al-Haj, the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) demands the omanic authorities on:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditionally release;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can pursue their work.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, representation is made with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not even mentioned in the media. it is a growing range that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on-site medical research: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, the research, which is conducted by African scientists himself, is being able to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">It grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic which showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored himself the HIV virus, before he decided to go home back home to support the Croatian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Moreover, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion of the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we are received are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the United States and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are encouraged to be different.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people back or want to move back here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What kind of obstacles are there in your routine research that you didn't like before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion regarding the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special scientific training, starting from each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research around the world, the healthcare sector (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: many times it is the limited speed to do things, and the clear access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are available only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), is limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" plant producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solution for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been screened in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company provides 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant which was grown by NASA-astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortal's work has been lost only by its own income and the question how many kinds of ointments can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to breed so further.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual sorts, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or trapped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more such patents have been registered to growing crops such as grain or cartons. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton defected forever, but it is longer necessary for this reason, since his work continues to be more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, than would lie in a river a boulder, in order to sweating myself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "thus we have to do that now, but it is a break with breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salads, because all the features are already patented. "so, so as good as possible and tries to propably those features, which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoring not to use material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have rebored the species Outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds pretty much more than would the movement come from the IT area and not from the sphere of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) is inspired by the motion for free "open source" software to inspire the alternatives to urgently protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and agents are not protected as intellectual property and so for plant breeders are permanently usable.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can also commit to be able to freely use the seed out of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This, however, does not mean that they can't continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who want to cross their seed, and it will not be out of different - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant paternities.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Discovering prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor Jack Kloppenburg is a member of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in larger confederations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by providing seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises the" "" "open source" "" "movement is not dealing with genetically altered plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, are expected to buy products from ecological agriculture and Monsanto and Bayer, which, for example, is offered on commercial markets such as the markets, should also know that the way of this vegetables is cultivated, as such vegetables are cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to keep others their seed still free at their disposal. in contrast, their prediction is to be patented in contrast to seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supports argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genital pool is due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights on plant materials, which is therefore always restricted to shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, employs itself in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability. it found that about one-third of all subfleet features are protected as intellectual property, which means it is either not useable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Other plants are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby discouraged that massenish plants were patented like wheat in a greater style, as side salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visit</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics, such as their taste or their colour enhances up to those who prosper in certain environments because of which they prosper in certain environments.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaducts acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activity. with a total of four gender banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States set up the company to preserve the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It does not contradict that intellectual property, other breeders, because "patents and the protection of plant varied innovations." a patent is basically taken as a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is not inhibited to innovations, but it promotes more material and know-how by the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton does not look like this: 20 years to wait until a patent pending, you certainly does not tap any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long, to be able to breed plants, which have been adapted to the altered environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common condition and continued to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monochrome incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept to patrol plant features: "we do not create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form themselves as breeders themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea of how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who are breeding a variety, has its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who are working on industrial agriculture with large farms and monoculators, for which cultivation herbicides are needed, stimulates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents), it can survive the majority of smaller seed companies, also without having to survive it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant engineer Frank Morton requires salads in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patenting: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new products, stronger than enterprises that patroned.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new stuff for my catalogue, because I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent for 20 years is protected from competition, so in my opinion it is quite easy to make. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Indeed, the US seems to be leading to the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept has meanwhile spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the newest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government announced the website of the New Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) that documents human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue their work and efforts to respect human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The book Network for Human Rights Information continues: despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the constitution because it was never so difficult to pursue these targets in this part of the world. however, even though it was never so difficult to overcome these goals, so it was not so important to overcome the lock and do not follow. we insist to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first-censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent News page Mada Masr, Arabic language of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera Network from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web side lockings to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnists and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt for not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he raised in order to circumvent the Zensitic of the Egyptian government, was the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is home to Ziadas blog, is also accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while it was reported on the student protests and capture a video as the police forces physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles turn mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed its locking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelaytah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blogs is not meaningful for the world, it is because of two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been successful to mediate me the feeling of skill, arrest, attempted murder, unloading of the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web site which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the item of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have closed it and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) locked Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 pages. this gave technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of providers by making it possible for Internet access and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we became aware of the lock of websites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice refers to the intention of the government to block content and filter it, to filter and filter access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also wormated in addition to the fact that the fensurities are closed behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to have no legal status, with which they can proceed in judgment against those actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will she attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a forced financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Even the United Nations, Brazilian NGO, called Global Justice to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexuality, etc. everything that happens in Rio will be released in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative way, so as journalists don't close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minutes video that was dealt on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision was no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure to be:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video there was a journalist in the newspaper, that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories there is to be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We realize that a war discourse, when it is distorted, if it is distorted, atrocities of the police, which only shoot and then asks questions to be missed.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Are the term "war" more than it used it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist argued that violence as "war" is argued to describe the violence as "war". this may be more difficult for a justification of the failed security policy through the media and might be difficult to educate responsibility in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra for the analysis of the military interest rate in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and historical and self-counterfeit neglect of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't tell it then, she knew that she would not see her son very long again - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning of dawn the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara were suddenly conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hate on the Hazara-known Taliban, came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a cohort. the work was difficult and sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left out of his low wages and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign land along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Today, like today, Afghan refugees were minted in Iran about misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf came in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon before open windows, so that we don't drowned at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and prepared himself for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and raveled on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day to food in need.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers due to a relatively high point of asylum seekers. it is true, however, that conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering under a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special advantageous centres. there are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared workers."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an emergency centre if they officially granted a motion for asylum - which may go up for months after registration of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbaffectionful life of life helped him to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made different work in construction industry for several years, Asharaf occupied his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well, that after a while he had a second hostel and a fast food outlet.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now theme of the documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (german: "behind the Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017, which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution based on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the last years, some of Afghanistan managed businesses, including cutting eries, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmaddi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience, where the waiter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna, and the Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs goals tend to go far beyond the Italian Gastronomy industry and retail trade, and aim back to the country that he had to leave unrivedly as teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happy when I know my people suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also works plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where humans will learn packaging and preservative techniques. "thus, they can sell their crop excess on the market and improve their financial situation." he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development for the successful entrepreneur was a trip through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghanistan on this path.</seg>
