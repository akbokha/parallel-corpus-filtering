this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times journalist .
long before the man had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , he wrote a book , in which he spectacular , that N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed down dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who was not right in the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and urged him to name his alleged springs .
in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and incar@@ n@@ ate journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Treaty , media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ aged them .
so when the government dropped at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous reporter had already done before him . he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they are ongoing for years , it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped at R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide themselves .
instead of fail@@ ing and to bring back to the statements , this also could do his own foot@@ prints for him .
and thus , the investig@@ ators , without his permission , were worried about his telephone conversation ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , finance and ban@@ kers , his credit rating , and even travel documents with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn for Jeffrey , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ er .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama ple@@ dged to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower in his sei@@ z@@ ure , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has become too much of their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so , we are putting the pressing work out of the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government has more possibilities to cut out all .
but just as technology of the government allows to avoid the rights of rep@@ airing , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , you can contact it from the moment in which they contact us , rather than in the desc@@ endant , in the witness .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when he had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source file system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by us from the internet of Internet , which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there , you can upload documents or send documents , as with any usual contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can &apos;t describe more information about it , and many of the information they would like would be from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments and all over the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that are all endangered .
it is to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den has a possibility to manifest ab@@ et@@ ates . it is equally important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower .
who wants to tell about ab@@ u@@ pris@@ ings at the supply of soldiers modest and of over@@ crowded hospitals , or the next environmental worker , the alarm for f@@ ou@@ ted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ paper Insider , who warned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that real@@ ities and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have hidden an explanation . &#93; this week , we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week , we asked news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents covered by Panama &apos;s Law@@ son Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
the prime minister of the Island became prime minister .
also , there are reports that an ally allied of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad made postal companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous to the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now the plot sounds like the plot of an agency owner , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
however , the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax phases , and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret control phases are used by some few , their fortune to hide and conce@@ aled - something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people will appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax phases work .
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ doll .
so , one firm has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those building .
it can be very difficult for law en@@ forcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no more prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , which were present in these sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ fts .
but by principle , after which these tax phases work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Island or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have seen much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to specify a firm to start a firm than to get a library .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed it to fold school children to school children .
it has ai@@ ds to fold , especially an@@ vil @-@ off@@ springs .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 attor@@ ney companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , to a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked , that all the right to a lawyer asked our investig@@ ator as he could transfer his money .
all these were pre@@ dic@@ tive . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nothing was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with that system .
it is also important to consider that not as individual accidents .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our missing investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top leader , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very hard @-@ minded , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing changed ever , it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot that I have started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen pre@@ bug to more transparency , regarding the owners of firms .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been caught in central regi@@ sters at national levels , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US lag@@ ging behind here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Par@@ liamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax phases , as a means is used to provide more transparency to the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need exec@@ utives in the economy that rise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this way to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story how I once ab@@ duc@@ ted almost and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das would have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a shop sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked up my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was in the city alone and just made a trip to the whole country . after that he would go to the peac@@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says that he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to throw away in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I fro@@ ze at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken ?
a wild living in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out from bed , on ti@@ p@@ toe at the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he had bought from me today , hangs up today in his class@@ room . he now is a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers have been sold , actually friends who waited for them to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air@@ mat@@ ri@@ ze was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a short break , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something like this . our apartment is offered to a designer Bed and Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , with a mattress and breakfast breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ee tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said to have passed our last guest and the door moved to the castle , Brian and I moved to us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent .
things came to rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website dedicated to the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing if you come over .
over the Internet , they can then invite people who invite people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would burn .
but she did not do them .
no one who still is still with consol@@ ation would invest in a business , the foreigner allowed to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we were all learned , strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you think about the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree of confidence we cont@@ ended .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will take you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to make you lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked mobile phone on your left seat .
this silent port of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when she opening the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
but sometimes so , who now has Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is di@@ ved for the President of President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had only been introduced with his name ; if he tells us how he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine you have 150 beats , all of which say : &quot; it can really hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ called feedback system strength@@ ens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard to enter the people , negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest were submitted to their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is to trust people each other , depending on how they are in terms of age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar .
the more the differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
it becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three powers , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation in common simil@@ arities .
so , the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ root pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re talking too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells a lot , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have trouble with my mother &quot; -- -- will the request be rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ ar art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we had not expected , the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredible lot of luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the shop is running very well .
of course there are times if not everything goes well .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties to celebrate or have destroyed homes .
guests will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront of the forefront , when trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s hurt if I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment , which one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there was only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays a small fraction .
because people trust each other .
when trust works , miracles can be created .
one of our guests had holiday in Uruguay and suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to main activities .
the area is beautifully furnished with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who save life even though they do not know correctly .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay expi@@ res .
but these relations behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I came over this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions relate together ?
it is all about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to call it , the thing is not just right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises the human relationships .
people have a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when one is going to travel nowadays , this is to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and dep@@ endable , but less authenti@@ cally .
what if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in every place we visits , a group would wait to wait for a group there to be a thoroughly defeat and to show a bar at a bar at a bar , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could prefer to learn a five @-@ star cook ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground to inter@@ connecting ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would be accept@@ ing the thoughts from common share ?
I imagine cities , which allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and imp@@ ot@@ ation .
the project has already begun in South Korean , Seoul , and has many parking spaces that belonged to the government .
people have now been offered to residents . students who were searching for a lead ,
people have convey@@ ed themselves to humans , whose children were come out . they were incub@@ ator programmes ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform only 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are invited to guests at a stranger or even hosts .
so the idea seems not to be mad how it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t invented the wheel .
there was a hospitality before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why does our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
down@@ right to overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da is passing to me .
we know of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I wonder how we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? a team of experts ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , undergo a brain la@@ under@@ ing , a terrorist act ?
or quite simply a delay in the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
the media is the same as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ powered , double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ eg@@ i@@ ke fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual mus@@ cular .
but not like Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born .
I decided to draw .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ st me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends but as mus@@ cul@@ ine . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you pressing yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , just opposite the pressure , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to fit me with a perfect and imm@@ utable beauty .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought , turned into question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow dedication to deep@@ en himself with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k causes me to weep .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel that somebody is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you completely understand , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the Egyptians , my career as engineering .
later , after my marriage , a child , I lived in the bottom of the &quot; Egyptian &quot; American Dream . &quot;
then came the dre@@ ad@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express cover . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people spro@@ uts out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock changed quickly to indignation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country had been attacked , but in the n@@ u transformed me the acts of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the integration study .
I remember as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was scar@@ ed for the first time to be known as mus@@ cular .
we stayed in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I beheld , and read , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Under@@ stand yourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings were : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were un@@ mistak@@ able , and I heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were held to Muslims , were un@@ locked and defeated .
there was really bran@@ dy on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this land , we attacked our country .
I have ri@@ pped the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to tell itself .
I have no questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the alleg@@ ations , which are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to put Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumour in the body of the United States .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ icious or good ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor was removed as a whole and a good tumor , one holds only under observation .
alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the inventor of the Te@@ ach@@ ers and the Te@@ ach@@ ers and Olymp@@ ion@@ ers .
will the closure of mos@@ ques the Americas make a safer place ?
it may be some parking bays , but not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque also leads to consider people of other faith toler@@ ant , and larger bourgeoisie .
and as a director of the police in the Washington , D.C. recently told , people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you are radi@@ c@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radi@@ cally process , it is determined that it starts online . as a result , the person is being cut off from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors her behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or of the faith .
if we want to prevent the radi@@ c@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS justified their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a nut@@ me@@ g as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add ourselves to their suburbs , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons of their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you throw a look at it , they don &apos;t drives what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had vor@@ ful to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every cler@@ gy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her heart for un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
it was inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of their anger , it was a main goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Ima@@ m set the connection to God and its church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her con@@ structive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she gave to the IS to join the IS .
that was a gli@@ mp@@ se of how Islam@@ opho@@ bia broke me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that when we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
we are more accept@@ ing a authorised government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if using test persons reported , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims left upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it was on the ap@@ ron of the war of Iraq and during two elec@@ tive periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mozambique terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool designed to manipul@@ ate the public in order to caves the foundation of a free society which has sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear troubles us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to declare themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in the Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most generous , generous human being , whom she knew .
she visited him there , and showed her his CV . she was afraid and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when should I have become such an experienced young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne at her brother and wife , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be im@@ mor@@ ally , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone towards the mosque or remained we safe to house ?
we discuss it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about to leave America to our children : one that would control us through fear , or that , in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided to the mosque .
we went up with our son in the seat of the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and put my shoes from him , and went into the hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us .
in this moment , I collapsed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and Fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go back to number ?
or will they connect to those who think : we are better than the ones .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have encountered a nerve .
but I ask myself what you might say that you &apos;re going to hold a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thinking with deep dive work , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say about those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive not . I am absolutely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
when people look to Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the largest such study on the Muslims in the whole world , people want normal things .
they want charity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as a rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to become a Billi@@ on@@ aire business shortly before .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air packs into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with ro@@ pes .
by connecting them , air @-@ units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to react to nature laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possi@@ bil@@ ty in the autonomous flight .
in order that a system is autonomous , it has to know collective intelligence , where the mobile objects can be found in the room .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alizing technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our lab@@ ors .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest point for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device , trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other starters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
contrary to most of the starters , it can be floating , and so great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a limitation of h@@ ed@@ lings is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind ro@@ ckets .
we develop new control units and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device no matter in which position is able to obtain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practi@@ cing .
okay .
during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions that are related to the core of the cause .
such a question would be : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to realize the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate in to hurt you .
many decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote control units that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear h@@ ed@@ der .
unfortunately , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ op@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est control unit . it was invented in front of a short term .
it only has a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ sts , no further pitch wheels or controllers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens much so that it can fly stable , and can move over in space .
nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right correctly .
the probability to throw it right if all of you see is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video which was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ os@@ inner is a practice in gen@@ ot@@ ation , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
through this he receives the quick@@ est ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is dar@@ ed in models , the rest is learned directly during the fly .
let &apos;s look at that .
if passengers should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and dep@@ endable .
this machine here consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this is clock@@ wise
and the other one to clock@@ wise .
when one builds them together , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a somewhat cro@@ f -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine again , although limited .
we will now demonstrate that we are able to make half an air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the great number of autonomous , coordinated units provide a range of aesthetic expression .
we ate commercially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate this demonstration to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there I want to be a flying lamp holder on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us there is a reward in the development and the works of the company .
it serves as a rec@@ olle@@ ction of how wonderful and magical is our universe , and that it allows creative , smart events to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is on the other .
thank you very much .
about 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far away galaxy , two black holes traveled together to each other , so they walked in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy .
this short moment , they were brigh@@ tened as all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big buttons .
they did not replace their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been given into space @-@ time record itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , the most recent life was made on earth .
since then the Earth has produced quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people , and -- God arise , -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a huge laser detector in order to seek after gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ating black holes .
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough men recognized them as a crazy genre , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , design , and extremely hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : laser inter@@ fer@@ vent @-@ based gra@@ vit@@ ation Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , which improved the detection output enorm@@ ously .
therefore , it is called the Advanced L@@ IG@@ O Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the use of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colored black holes were through the ground .
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my father &apos;s father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating spirits like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ation waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a c@@ abling in the g@@ ging of space and time .
when passing the shaft , space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and turn into the other .
for illustration in courses , lec@@ tur@@ ers often lead to a right al@@ ber@@ y dance in courses of theory .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched to the waves of waves and st@@ amped . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . on this reason , the L@@ IG@@ O @-@ workers explained to go crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nucle@@ us radius . that &apos;s Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties under construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are inher@@ ent and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott refuse to L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear than one eye .
I would like to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us : fac@@ ial trains , the size of your cell phones .
that is quite practical . for example , you can produce a picture or map of things by allowing you to perceive that of several points ahead .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
it is therefore very difficult to produce a picture of things that can give you a lot of things :
about the face of your child .
instead , we wait for certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind .
&quot; now I talks to Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks her . &quot;
&quot; number Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can no longer make pictures of objects in all .
but by touching changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
so , when we convert wave pattern into sound , we can listen to all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation , too , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott worked very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ turn@@ able holes , zir@@ pen easy : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn out very quickly , you can hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional audio change . it sounds like that : w@@ u @-@ bo@@ g @-@ bo@@ g @-@ g@@ wu :
it is a kind of movement of movement , engraved in the wave form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O Fol@@ lowing : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; Note : this is known as the sound of -- SH , ... two black holes with 30 times the mass mass , which are about as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : superior us briefly , what it means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 sun , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
in this there is the lasting importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O kick off a completely new way to explore the universe , as it was never before .
this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can - practically or general -- do not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ages stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
the exciting physical processes are , however , at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through , since these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are penet@@ rating iron , when it would be transparent glass . the pri@@ st@@ all : I would never want to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is veil@@ ed by his own neighbor .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible until back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimi@@ stic about that in all things we have never seen , which we never will never see and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O did not expect in the first run of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars , which produce black holes , like L@@ IG@@ O they are watching , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so @-@ called the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ uns for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to make a completely different look at the events in all , at the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as only possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atory -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on the earth and in all .
because what could be more beautiful than the urine itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
take your dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared because of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous , made me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
I wanted to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : I was afraid , when I was afraid , and removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes , I changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , who changed my life , on a unexpected item . it all started with a question of my least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the little ones , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statements , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates , I need milk for my be@@ ak t@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her to see if I could play with her , when I was just in the jump . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this too was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from there I listened to them always with them , as soon as you are looking for to it . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wherever I go , I say always Yes -- each single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently , I was really certain that &quot; Yes &quot; sin@@ ks to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things , we@@ ave it for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I professional television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time .
every show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days , four shows , plus four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs that are at the same time : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series are running succession on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I create myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sol@@ ete . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world burning .
do you know who this is still doing ?
no one , this is why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work as hard as you can now take a firm , a land or a class room , so that I say that I am not just around the computer and creative , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that there is not a dream job of dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I fall into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is creating a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up troops , as painting I painted on a canvas .
as a dream , one a high tone , running a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and sil@@ ly , cruel and reasonable , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there &apos;s so a change in me if the job runs well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grow , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go on for ever .
many people participate , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I will say that writing is joy to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with TV production when I began to work and work together to create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot act elsewhere than according to size .
the feeling that is not to be different than according to size , no matter what price .
this is what we call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it is gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s called E@@ go .
maybe it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I was not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I will , more episodes , more episodes , the more work there is , the more things happening , the more I write stories , the more I write story , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I do about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , ex@@ agger@@ ated , over@@ run .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters were acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells you : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my ann@@ y . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimates , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ es .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , processed weekends , no repentance , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleep does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was sum@@ mer@@ se and the sum@@ s was I .
what do you do if that , what you do , the work that you love , is suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ crit@@ es you from , during the author of Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , one loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you love one another and that &apos;s one of the sum@@ s , if you know the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s even if the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart hear@@ eth , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m looking outside , late and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell me when two things are aware of :
first , I need to say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , they didn &apos;t called me &quot; prize . &quot;
you don &apos;t call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ony &quot; . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan I and my sum@@ s get drunk , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
and this is how she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and hold their sisters , we have a lot and I read off dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ik , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the corporation , can &apos;t do anything except that .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land that I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they do not exist anymore .
all that exists a sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , qu@@ ills and song , in which it &apos;s slo@@ ping , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The Iron Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close to that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy ub comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the h@@ um , the titanium surface , that &apos;s only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I say to you , who I am when I will send me using ship@@ ments and TV , and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is non @-@ working .
it is dep@@ endant on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dep@@ ended on love .
the sum@@ s is the power that comes from life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , expectations and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe whis@@ per@@ ed me to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I am doing this for a fixed rule , so that I can deliver me as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic from any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in play , I don &apos;t like it .
play does not play ans@@ at@@ as to me , how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to be at home as home .
this confession is painful , for what a person does rather than to be in house ?
well yes , me .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too Rel@@ ax@@ ed , none of them is .
we r@@ ens around in the garden , back and back , go back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how one lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can also say it ! they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for n@@ ai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ aming .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me , till they want to make something else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ eller or K@@ eks will replace me .
and talk to me my teen @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not need .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a sun@@ day mood !
15 minutes on piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no cooling .
the day is short : dinner , ready for children .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my char@@ le@@ makers , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for peace of mind .
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
give yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out it and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I have victories . friends meet , reading books , read the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show , when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why don &apos;t allow a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it accompl@@ ishes me and my soul . you reject me with new ideas . I use it in full tra@@ ps and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of labour is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying to me that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more cle@@ arer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I create , the marathon , I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , up@@ beat , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think of things I would like to make you life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit bear@@ able .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too much work and to play .
Titan@@ es do not have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; low @-@ stag @-@ stimulation . &quot; in this case , you im@@ plant@@ ate an electro@@ de deep within the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson , who suffered severe trembling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ Healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician , working day and night in the emergency .
I often found patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain d@@ ull @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a is sensitive to the brain and rising the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure .
to save life , you have to reduce the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure pressure .
in this case , sometimes you have to remove a part of the brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this fabric .
that is no easy task .
cells of a tissue piece grow , comparable to all small children who are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ology classes that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nuts of the brain .
it is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells out of the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slowly divided and after a few weeks , they even died .
we therefore saw a new , strange cell @-@ population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand what they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our hi@@ den@@ ial cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ g@@ us , they care for the division of the brain .
but why do they remain ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but that is not so safe .
one thing is , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that enables the bra@@ id healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells in this way , as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark the color of far@@ ther , in order to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we planted them on the site of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we do these cells in normal brain tissue honour ? and what will happen if we offer the same cells in sh@@ itty old brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks , they had disappeared completely , they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we prepared a violation and seem@@ ingly p@@ anti@@ es exactly the same cells and now the cells remained , they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which have been pl@@ ung@@ ed .
the proof that they show is these small points . these are the cells that we t@@ apped in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here , of course .
do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained keys with a manual de@@ x@@ ural strength .
they had to take feeding pellets of a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable success level , we have reached the engine mot@@ ion@@ ic area in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex .
then the monkey was paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic bra@@ id mechanisms . you can recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side you see the monkey , which recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from inf@@ rin@@ gement of injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now you see , when we planted the cells in honour : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation of the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still going to im@@ planted with human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the resources to heal themselves .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who you need . &quot;
I definitely have any case .
of course the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it will take , until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate treatment , whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply to a multi @-@ centre study .
one must first re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable dam@@ aging .
we believe that capitalism is forced to inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large after@@ im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven to doubt that it is indeed possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democr@@ atically .
in fact , democracy is van@@ ishing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece , the newly elected Greek government -- was declared un@@ equi@@ voc@@ able to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- will not be influenced by the economy that was implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sow@@ ed friends who would repeat me that the democracy would be abolished .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves to democracy , but that we need a truly and advoc@@ ate democracy .
because without democracy our societies are ob@@ serving , our future g@@ ame@@ fully , and our great , new technologies are spar@@ ed .
as an example , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently has been threatened by our hosts .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . they know and acknowledge him as the mountain den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few are recogni@@ zable to his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which might seem to be anxi@@ ous to invest there , where it would be productive and income , with which one could carry out the debt of debt , and could also produce all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in the United States , in all the prosperity of goods , such as industries , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sound a lot of money until it compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 trillion $ , which at the same time compar@@ es in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the Bör@@ sen re@@ b@@ ates and gr@@ abs the real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit that are not out of the usual market mechanisms .
the outcome are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds are unemployed , and thus making a low overall economic demand that could not invest in a low demand for investors who could not invest in a low demand . exactly as Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , which could not be justified in fear , that his Son would kill him when he is grown up ,
un@@ wanted to hand the circumstances that lead to kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with Capit@@ alism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing our lives , developing human resources and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a company form , where the free and poor control the government .
of course the ath@@ etic democracy was of course too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these fail@@ ures .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she was the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial to them , which they gave to them the right to political participation in question of state pet@@ ition@@ ing .
true democracy has not kept long .
like a candle , which is very bright , she is also burned down quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have its roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ etic democracy was focused on the free citizens and strengthened the labour , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for mist@@ ress .
because the liberal democracy was only able to form a complete separation of politics and economy and the democratic process has ended on politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - a democracy @-@ free zone became .
in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the date , in which this separation from politics and economy began , an in@@ herit@@ ated struggle between the two , by pushing the economy into politics and liber@@ ates them .
do you wish to be wonder@@ ing why politicians are not so much more like before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is that one can be in the government today , but not in power because the power of politics is descending into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which under@@ nourished the animals , from which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end of this .
it is similar to the economy that regul@@ ates the policy so far that it grows through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations increases , economic demand increases and the managing director of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the successful capitalism in the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; cut off the democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the wealth of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we must bring together the policies and the economy , and it would be better when the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t strange .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it , by producing low wages , by automation and robot .
the problem is , as long as economy and policies are separate areas , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste increased , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
thus , we have to re@@ shaping the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and in order to democr@@ at@@ ize the recovered area , otherwise we end in a health monitoring hyper@@ tension , which suggests the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is , not whether capitalism has brought the technological achievements , which he has brought forth . --
an interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of the society in &quot; star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving the people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations of life .
I think we are not allowed to be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it mean , how could this look like to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in the brief , some examples .
in the area of the company , please imagine a capital market before you make money , while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then , all the income from capital and income from waste and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those whom the companies belong , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there , but no more wage differenti@@ ated between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and savings , and ultimately no more thr@@ illing twin summit .
in the area of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; will be issued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trading income of the country , into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment resources are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a unified policy and business .
the world that I describe you is liber@@ ally liber@@ alized at the same time , in which they are privileged and fav@@ oured , and Marx@@ ist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ast@@ ically , globally ke@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous .
but above all , it is a world where we can introduce ourselves real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography , as liber@@ ating Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ si@@ is : if something of what I have just said is , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... Do we do it , the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry sum@@ mers are known as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis of one part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise , Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how key@@ nes I , and therefore , I am perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have told you very clearly what you think from the view of the West to China .
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , during the area where most of the sector plays , -- the area of the economy -- a fully democracy @-@ free zone .
in some respects , when I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the United Kingdom of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically viewed .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what can be observed in China , quite similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now , to propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious to share your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I realized that this comes .
BG : yeah ...
how do you look back six months later to the first six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone .
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to self @-@ proof , and the den@@ ial den@@ ying that a massive over@@ throwing line was passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity based on the Greek pre @-@ slaughter -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion was revealed to this den@@ ial --
it is right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain a economic system that is not vital to life through political will and Author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be possible for a while , but when the change happens , it passes ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what ways do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro area has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness , ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , particularly in such a sp@@ oo@@ ed situation , he claims no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made errors .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for extending the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t give it .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the dis@@ gra@@ d@@ ations they ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to remember that they led a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders that imposed us this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the Euro Area towards someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , they will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extracted flow forces and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not alone have cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be dre@@ aming for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
the most still never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an iris and describes Twitter as &quot; Movi@@ es , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and content that will produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any of them .
he must find shows that are very , very well .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height indicates how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; - all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after one has looked for a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
that kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going to end at the end of the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not concern himself to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes himself more thoughts about the mean be@@ ating , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like this , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk their risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps performing a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where each one can watch for free .
and if Amazon does not make things out for free , please do it right ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re watching when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team that record everything .
you capture when one starts the show , when you p@@ auses , the parts you ski@@ p or look again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them to produce .
in fact they collect the data , process this and from it gives the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US transm@@ itters . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always searching for this a super show , and he does not use the data for it , but it does something different .
instead of running a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , thus the reviews they give to the shows , their changes , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows they like producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , this is the question : what happened here ?
it has two very competent , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
how is this ?
because the logic somehow says that this should work at all .
if you collect million data , for a decision that meets , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , this is something terri@@ fying , because we live in time , in which we live more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions , far beyond TV .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with that , you are in prison .
if someone is here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium television , 22 minutes , that may be real bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . it is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems is not knowing how to use data .
the data diversi@@ fied companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was possible to prevent data analysis out@@ breaks from flu , the worst way , - by data analysis of the Google search .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news ens@@ ation . the success culmin@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , it was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are reversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes .
in spite of all these errors , data will be reflected in the decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal status , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of an medication . I have recognised some patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
to solve this in a complex problem , do not do two things :
as a result , put this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , you put the individual parts again to hold a decision .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and re@@ iter@@ ate them again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to tear and understand his parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we are all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble pieces and pieces , even if the information is in@@ complete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if the brain is of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and understanding , where they belong also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why it wouldn &apos;t have been able to meet their audience , but the decision to put together all those parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show for this show , which meant that they went on a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they w@@ ett@@ led TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision , because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I think things run wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and that &apos;s not forgotten is this device quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will be demo later with a technique demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , and I would have to listen to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little more cl@@ amping factor , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
however this does not change the basic structure .
so , perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er , and wis@@ er . finally , it is to us to make decisions , if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that , in spite of the great amount of data , it is still paying out to make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing , and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks where you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
