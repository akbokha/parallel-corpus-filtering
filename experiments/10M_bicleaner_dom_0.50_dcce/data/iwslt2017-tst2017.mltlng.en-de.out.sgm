<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before the man had heard of Edward Snowden, he wrote a book, in which he spectacular, that NSA has illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed down drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who was not right in the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and urged him to name his alleged springs.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn Whistleblower and incarnate journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Treaty, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the couraged them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government dropped at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter had already done before him. he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they are ongoing for years, it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped at Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and to bring back to the statements, this also could do his own footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, the investigators, without his permission, were worried about his telephone conversation,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, finance and bankers, his credit rating, and even travel documents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn for Jeffrey, a CIA-Whistleblower and Riser.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama pledged to protect Whistleblower in his seizure, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has become too much of their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a Whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we are putting the pressing work out of the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional complaints, because the government has more possibilities to cut out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to avoid the rights of repairing, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, you can contact it from the moment in which they contact us, rather than in the descendant, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when he had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source file system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by us from the internet of Internet, which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There, you can upload documents or send documents, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't describe more information about it, and many of the information they would like would be from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments and all over the world develop new spy technologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden has a possibility to manifest abetates. it is equally important that we protect the next Whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to tell about abuprisings at the supply of soldiers modest and of overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker, the alarm for fouted water of Flint. or a Wallpaper Insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest data sheet of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that realities and Mighty] have hidden an explanation.] this week, we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] this week, we asked news about a Leck of 11 million documents covered by Panama's Lawson Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister of the Island became prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an ally allied of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad made postal companies in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous celist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous to the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now the plot sounds like the plot of an agency owner, or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">However, the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax phases, and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">These revelations are phenomenal for my organization, Global Witness.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret control phases are used by some few, their fortune to hide and concealed - something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax phases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matrjoschdoll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one firm has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no more prominent Americans in these revelations, which were present in these scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax hafts.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these tax phases work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Island or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have seen much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to specify a firm to start a firm than to get a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed it to fold school children to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has aids to fold, especially anvil-offsprings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 attorney companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, to a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked, that all the right to a lawyer asked our investigator as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">All these were predictive. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nothing was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with that system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as individual accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our missing investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top leader, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very hard-minded, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing changed ever, it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot that I have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen prebug to more transparency, regarding the owners of firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been caught in central registers at national levels, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax phases, as a means is used to provide more transparency to the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that rise and say," "" "Intransparent" "" "is not good for the business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use this way to end this type of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I once abducted almost and in the boot of a red Mazdas would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a shop sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood and looked up my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and just made a trip to the whole country. after that he would go to the peaccorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says that he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to throw away in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I froze at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out from bed, on tiptoe at the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he had bought from me today, hangs up today in his classroom. he now is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers have been sold, actually friends who waited for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my airmatrize was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a short break, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something like this. our apartment is offered to a designer Bed and Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, with a mattress and breakfast breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omelee tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said to have passed our last guest and the door moved to the castle, Brian and I moved to us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent.</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we would like to create a website dedicated to the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing if you come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite people who invite people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not do them.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who still is still with consolation would invest in a business, the foreigner allowed to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we were all learned, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you think about the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree of confidence we contended.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will take you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to make you lock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent port of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when she opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But sometimes so, who now has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is dived for the President of President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had only been introduced with his name; if he tells us how he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 beats, all of which say: "it can really hold very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-called feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to enter the people, negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest were submitted to their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is to trust people each other, depending on how they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more the differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three powers, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation in common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So, the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-root preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're talking too little, for example, "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells a lot, for example," "" "I have trouble with my mother" -- -- will the request be rather not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "Tolar art works in your apartment! I'm doing vacation with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not expected, the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible lot of luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not everything goes well.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties to celebrate or have destroyed homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront of the forefront, when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it's hurt if I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there was only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays a small fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracles can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests had holiday in Uruguay and suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to main activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautifully furnished with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who save life even though they do not know correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I came over this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions relate together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is all about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now just" "" "tense" "" "to call it, the thing is not just right." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises the human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People have a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When one is going to travel nowadays, this is to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and dependable, but less authentically.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place we visits, a group would wait to wait for a group there to be a thoroughly defeat and to show a bar at a bar at a bar, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could prefer to learn a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground to interconnecting?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would be accepting the thoughts from common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities, which allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and impotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">The project has already begun in South Korean, Seoul, and has many parking spaces that belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">People have now been offered to residents. students who were searching for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">People have conveyed themselves to humans, whose children were come out. they were incubator programmes,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in Share Economy. over our platform only 785 000 people in 191 countries are invited to guests at a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be mad how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was a hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda is passing to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us when it had this great influence, I wonder how we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a team of experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, undergo a brain laundering, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or quite simply a delay in the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">The media is the same as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-powered, double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealegike fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual muscular.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga is singing, because, baby, I was not born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to draw.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to oust me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends but as musculine. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you pressing yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, just opposite the pressure, which I felt as 17-year-old felt to fit me with a perfect and immutable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, turned into question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow dedication to deepen himself with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik causes me to weep.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel that somebody is perceiving you, you completely understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, a child, I lived in the bottom of the "Egyptian" American Dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the dreadful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Express cover."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people sprouts out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed quickly to indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched to the TV channel and heard:" "" "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country had been attacked, but in the nu transformed me the acts of others by a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the integration study.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as we were silent -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat, and I was scared for the first time to be known as muscular.</seg>
<seg id="304">We stayed in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world felt.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I beheld, and read, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "" "Be careful" "", "Be careful" "", "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Understand yourselves" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings were: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were unmistakable, and I heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were held to Muslims, were unlocked and defeated.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really brandy on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, we attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have ripped the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to tell itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have no questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">"" "" "" "there are the allegations, which are hard." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to put Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumour in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malicious or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor was removed as a whole and a good tumor, one holds only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are the inventor of the Teachers and the Teachers and Olympioners.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques the Americas make a safer place?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be some parking bays, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque also leads to consider people of other faith tolerant, and larger bourgeoisie.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a director of the police in the Washington, D.C. recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radically process, it is determined that it starts online. as a result, the person is being cut off from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors her behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or of the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent the radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS justified their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a nutmeg as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add ourselves to their suburbs, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons of their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you throw a look at it, they don't drives what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had vorful to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her heart for unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">It was inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of their anger, it was a main goal for instrumentalisation by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "" "" "this Imam set the connection to God and its church." ""</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she gave to the IS to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a glimpse of how Islamophobia broke me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that when we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more accepting a authorised government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if using test persons reported, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims left upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was on the apron of the war of Iraq and during two elective periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mozambique terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool designed to manipulate the public in order to caves the foundation of a free society which has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear troubles us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to declare themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in the Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most generous, generous human being, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her his CV. she was afraid and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when should I have become such an experienced young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and wife, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immorally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone towards the mosque or remained we safe to house?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discuss it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about to leave America to our children: one that would control us through fear, or that, in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We went up with our son in the seat of the children's seat, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and put my shoes from him, and went into the hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thank our guests, because half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and Fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go back to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will they connect to those who think: we are better than the ones.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have encountered a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself what you might say that you're going to hold a TEDTalk, a thinking with deep dive work, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say about those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say deceive not. I am absolutely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When people look to Muslims in all over the world, and I did that with the largest such study on the Muslims in the whole world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want charity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, the rule is often broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, is about to become a Billionaire business shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packs into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting them, air-units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turmoil and to react to nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibilty in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order that a system is autonomous, it has to know collective intelligence, where the mobile objects can be found in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localizing technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our labors.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest point for example" "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device, trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Contrary to most of the starters, it can be floating, and so great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedlings is that they react sensitively to turmoil like wind rockets.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new control units and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device no matter in which position is able to obtain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions that are related to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to realize the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate in to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Many decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote control units that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear hedder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monopinner, the mechanically simplest control unit. it was invented in front of a short term.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinges and cross-rusts, no further pitch wheels or controllers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens much so that it can fly stable, and can move over in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right if all of you see is low, so I'll show you a video which was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monosinner is a practice in genotation, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Through this he receives the quickest ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is dared in models, the rest is learned directly during the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If passengers should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and dependable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other one to clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a somewhat crof -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine again, although limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are able to make half an airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, coordinated units provide a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We ate commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and fit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate this demonstration to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there I want to be a flying lamp holder on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us there is a reward in the development and the works of the company.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a recollection of how wonderful and magical is our universe, and that it allows creative, smart events to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is on the other.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far away galaxy, two black holes traveled together to each other, so they walked in a tenths of pure energy in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they were brightened as all the stars together in all the galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big buttons.</seg>
<seg id="472">They did not replace their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been given into space-time record itself and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, the most recent life was made on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people, and -- God arise, -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector in order to seek after gravitation waves, which are caused by colliating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough men recognized them as a crazy genre, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design, and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: laser interfervent-based gravitation Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO increased significantly, which improved the detection output enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called the Advanced LIGO Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the use of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colored black holes were through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating spirits like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitation waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a cabling in the gging of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and turn into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration in courses, lecturers often lead to a right albery dance in courses of theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched to the waves of waves and stamped. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means that 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. on this reason, the LIGO-workers explained to go crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandths of a nucleus radius. that's Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "technical difficulties under construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inherent and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">To LIGO. Scott refuse to LIGO be more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial trains, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. for example, you can produce a picture or map of things by allowing you to perceive that of several points ahead.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">It is therefore very difficult to produce a picture of things that can give you a lot of things:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we wait for certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now I talks to Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can no longer make pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by touching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are in the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So, when we convert wave pattern into sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation, too, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-turnable holes, zirpen easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn out very quickly, you can hear the same cirpen with an additional audio change. it sounds like that: wu-bog-bog-gwu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, engraved in the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Following: [Surrender of noise] Note: this is known as the sound of -- SH,... two black holes with 30 times the mass mass, which are about as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior us briefly, what it means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sun, the other with a mass of 36 sun, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the lasting importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO kick off a completely new way to explore the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">This way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can - practically or general -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massages stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are, however, at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves are penetrating iron, when it would be transparent glass. the pristall: I would never want to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is veiled by his own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitation waves, it should be possible until back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic about that in all things we have never seen, which we never will never see and of which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO did not expect in the first run of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars, which produce black holes, like LIGO they are watching, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so-called the Saurierknouns for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to make a completely different look at the events in all, at the origin of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a completely new generation of observatories on the earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than the urine itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Take your dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say" Yes! "" "" I feared because of whom I feared. "" "</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, made me in unpleasant situations, I forced to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: I was afraid, when I was afraid, and removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, I changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, who changed my life, on a unexpected item. it all started with a question of my least.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the little ones, called" "" "statements," "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimates, I need milk for my beak tasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her to see if I could play with her, when I was just in the jump. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This too was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from there I listened to them always with them, as soon as you are looking for to it. no matter what I'm doing, or wherever I go, I say always Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I feel very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I was really certain that "Yes" sinks to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things, weave it for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I professional television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days, four shows, plus four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs that are at the same time: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running succession on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I create myself, and not only produced, so still obsolete. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world burning.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, this is why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work as hard as you can now take a firm, a land or a class room, so that I say that I am not just around the computer and creative, and it's true if I say: I understand that there is not a dream job of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I fall into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is creating a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops, as painting I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream, one a high tone, running a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and disturbing, clinically and silly, cruel and reasonable, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There's so a change in me if the job runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grow, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go on for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate, if I tell them the sums that I will say that writing is joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with TV production when I began to work and work together to create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you cannot act elsewhere than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that is not to be different than according to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what we call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I was not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I will, more episodes, more episodes, the more work there is, the more things happening, the more I write stories, the more I write story, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I do about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, exaggerated, overrun.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters were accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells you: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my anny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanes.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, processed weekends, no repentance, nothing delegate, a titanium sleep does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was summerse and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">What do you do if that, what you do, the work that you love, is suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some people think:" "" "hypocrites you from, during the author of Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you do, one loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you love one another and that's one of the sums, if you know the sums, if you stop the sums even if the sums stops, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart heareth, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "presents me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm looking outside, late and she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell me when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I need to say Yes to everything and secondly, they didn't called me "prize."</seg>
<seg id="675">You don't call anyone more "estimony". "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums get drunk, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And this is how she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and hold their sisters, we have a lot and I read off dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panik, in solitude and in the absence of the corporation, can't do anything except that.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists a sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, quills and song, in which it's sloping, or whatever the girl leaves in "The Iron Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close to that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the hum, the titanium surface, that's only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I say to you, who I am when I will send me using shipments and TV, and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is non-working.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependant on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is depended on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power that comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, expectations and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe whispered me to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this for a fixed rule, so that I can deliver me as a workaholic from any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in play, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play does not play ansatas to me, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at home as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a person does rather than to be in house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too Relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rens around in the garden, back and back, go back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"" "" "" "my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me, till they want to make something else." ""</seg>

<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no cooling.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, ready for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charlemakers, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and store it.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it accomplishes me and my soul. you reject me with new ideas. I use it in full traps and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of labour is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's annoying to me that I am a titanium. I've never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>

<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I create, the marathon, I run, the canvases, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, upbeat, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think of things I would like to make you life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That's the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit bearable.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too much work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanes do not have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most well known, the "low-stag-stimulation." in this case, you implantate an electrode deep within the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-Healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician, working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often found patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain dull-traumata is sensitive to the brain and rising the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull-pressure pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">In this case, sometimes you have to remove a part of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">That is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue piece grow, comparable to all small children who are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biology classes that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nuts of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells out of the surface tissues of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly divided and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange cell-population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand what they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our hidenial cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fogus, they care for the division of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that enables the braid healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in this way, as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark the color of farther, in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planted them on the site of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we do these cells in normal brain tissue honour? and what will happen if we offer the same cells in shitty old brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks, they had disappeared completely, they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we prepared a violation and seemingly panties exactly the same cells and now the cells remained, they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which have been plunged.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show is these small points. these are the cells that we tapped in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here, of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained keys with a manual dexural strength.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable success level, we have reached the engine motionic area in the motoric Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkey was paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic braid mechanisms. you can recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side you see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from infringement of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see, when we planted the cells in honour: the same monkey, two months after the implantation of the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still going to implanted with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the resources to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who you need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely have any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it will take, until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate treatment, whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply to a multi-centre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable damaging.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is forced to inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large afterimitators in Beijing have proven to doubt that it is indeed possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratically.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is vanishing with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece, the newly elected Greek government -- was declared unequivocable to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- will not be influenced by the economy that was implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sowed friends who would repeat me that the democracy would be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves to democracy, but that we need a truly and advocate democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are observing, our future gamefully, and our great, new technologies are spared.</seg>
<seg id="914">As an example, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction, which currently has been threatened by our hosts.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. they know and acknowledge him as the mountain denberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few are recognizable to his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which might seem to be anxious to invest there, where it would be productive and income, with which one could carry out the debt of debt, and could also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in the United States, in all the prosperity of goods, such as industries, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sound a lot of money until it compares it with the $5.1 trillion $, which at the same time compares in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the Börsen rebates and grabs the real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit that are not out of the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The outcome are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds are unemployed, and thus making a low overall economic demand that could not invest in a low demand for investors who could not invest in a low demand. exactly as Ödipus Father, which could not be justified in fear, that his Son would kill him when he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted to hand the circumstances that lead to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing our lives, developing human resources and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a company form, where the free and poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the athetic democracy was of course too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minate the job value of the Athenian democracy due to these failures.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she was the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial to them, which they gave to them the right to political participation in question of state petitioning.</seg>
<seg id="935">True democracy has not kept long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, she is also burned down quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have its roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athetic democracy was focused on the free citizens and strengthened the labour, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy was only able to form a complete separation of politics and economy and the democratic process has ended on politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - a democracy-free zone became.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the date, in which this separation from politics and economy began, an inheritated struggle between the two, by pushing the economy into politics and liberates them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wish to be wondering why politicians are not so much more like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can be in the government today, but not in power because the power of politics is descending into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of predators, which undernourished the animals, from which they are nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end of this.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that regulates the policy so far that it grows through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations increases, economic demand increases and the managing director of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful capitalism in the "demos" [the people] cut off the democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we must bring together the policies and the economy, and it would be better when the "demos" retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, by producing low wages, by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and policies are separate areas, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste increased, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus, we have to reshaping the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and in order to democratize the recovered area, otherwise we end in a health monitoring hypertension, which suggests the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, not whether capitalism has brought the technological achievements, which he has brought forth. --</seg>
<seg id="958">An interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of the society in "star Trek," in which machines are serving the people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we are not allowed to be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it mean, how could this look like to have this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you, in the brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company, please imagine a capital market before you make money, while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all the income from capital and income from waste and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those whom the companies belong, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there, but no more wage differentiated between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no more thrilling twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets] will be issued.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency --" "" "Kosmos," "" "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trading income of the country, into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time there was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a unified policy and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is liberally liberalized at the same time, in which they are privileged and favoured, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesiastically, globally keynchronous.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can introduce ourselves real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "matrix" - similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography, as liberating Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varousiis: if something of what I have just said is, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... Do we do it, the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry summers are known as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis of one part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise, Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how keynes I, and therefore, I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have told you very clearly what you think from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, during the area where most of the sector plays, -- the area of the economy -- a fully democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, when I may say so provocative, China today resembles the United Kingdom of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China, quite similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now, to propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious to share your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I realized that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yeah...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to self-proof, and the denial denying that a massive overthrowing line was passed through the eurozone, and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity based on the Greek pre-slaughter -- the way, the first suggestion was revealed to this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continued to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain a economic system that is not vital to life through political will and Authoritarianism, it may be possible for a while, but when the change happens, it passes abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what ways do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro area has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness,...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, particularly in such a spooed situation, he claims no mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made errors.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for extending the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't give it.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the disgradations they ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to remember that they led a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the lenders that imposed us this policy," "" "this was a colossaler mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these, and despite the aggressive sound of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Euro Area towards someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, they will be" "" "extracted flow forces and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not alone have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be dreaming for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">The most still never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an iris and describes Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and content that will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any of them.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very well.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height indicates how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "- all the shows that are addictive, where, after one has looked for a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">That kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- "" "" -- that should tell you enough what is going to end at the end of the turn. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not concern himself to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes himself more thoughts about the mean beating, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like this, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk their risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps performing a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where each one can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon does not make things out for free, please do it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they're watching when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when one starts the show, when you pauses, the parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact they collect the data, process this and from it gives the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember this show, because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always searching for this a super show, and he does not use the data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of running a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewer, thus the reviews they give to the shows, their changes, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: which shows they like producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together, they went a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, this is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">How is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow says that this should work at all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect million data, for a decision that meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work so, this is something terrifying, because we live in time, in which we live more and more to statistics in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with that, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium television, 22 minutes, that may be real bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. it is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems is not knowing how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data diversified companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was possible to prevent data analysis outbreaks from flu, the worst way, - by data analysis of the Google search.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news ensation. the success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, it was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are reversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data will be reflected in the decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal status, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of an medication. I have recognised some patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">To solve this in a complex problem, do not do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, put this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, you put the individual parts again to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and reiterate them again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to tear and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we are all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble pieces and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if the brain is of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and understanding, where they belong also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why it wouldn't have been able to meet their audience, but the decision to put together all those parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show for this show, which meant that they went on a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they wettled TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision, because they always could say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I think things run wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and that's not forgotten is this device quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely," "" "exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be demo later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, and I would have to listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little more clamping factor, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">However this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So, perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser, and wiser. finally, it is to us to make decisions, if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that, in spite of the great amount of data, it is still paying out to make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks where you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
