Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are going to meet young people .
a pit @-@ chapel , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is buried for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ ker promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying if maps are not present .
this knows everybody who had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i , instead of a Um@@ r@@ ying road , displayed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern regional government , are all other than currently - but are very impressive .
especially when compared with current online maps .
then , it is clear that cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich office since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a patch covering , which you can &apos;t know as such .
in the vast plain map for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves , were incorporated .
this was produced according to the Bavarian State Department , between 1810 and 1864 , and jump in the first dimension of Bay@@ erns .
your principal : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 the French army leader was occupied during the Second Coalition War in Austria .
Napoleon requested an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns , of course , for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops went up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , today &apos;s neighbours , which created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ele@@ ctor Max IV . Joseph understood the project , founded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian Authority website .
the comparison early / Today , the example of the state capital is the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ stitution , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , joined the district in Munich .
today , sub@@ missions is in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ took to focus in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ road , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the western park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming appears , a smaller map with dozens lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ination , &quot; derived from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; little plots present there today no farmers , but rather small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , was the place of the Oktober@@ fest , in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete coast .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the primitive position , in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , reads not only the names of the street &quot; at the lu@@ str@@ ust &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road , one once represented people with ma@@ dness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; was created in the Au@@ er ventilation .
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that of the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the sett@@ es of the so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ der , who employed himself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients was first place , and later was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the rotary inde@@ xes in hair in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is there since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist Germany .
at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities .
West lies the football pitch of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built in an architectural style on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance that had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger Street &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change caused by the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big still remained until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pits from the Middle Ages were once on Mari@@ enhof , where these days work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place .
with the shooting star the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights organization published travel warning for Missouri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for supporting colored color has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board , which is to come into force by August 28th , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , where you could have particular attention to the state as a number of frag@@ mentary , terra@@ ced out@@ ages in the entire state and noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes people harder to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as prosecution of the state that are disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately upon minorities , said the Group to release the travel warning , &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have the injuries of the civil rights , the human beings .
they are defeated or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear symptoms in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the Group benef@@ ited as r@@ assi@@ stic violence against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was charged by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by Missouri , which is shown that black drivers will keep 75 percent more common in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what might happen in Missouri &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring us , whether they bring Cau@@ tion money or relatives , that they may travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the end of 2015 , Missouri came out in Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from Hass@@ elt &apos;s report of the FBI to set the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th ranking of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states of immigration authorities undertake to imp@@ ose the local law en@@ forcement agencies which contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to further development pro@@ filing .
changes are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
consecr@@ ation project is elementary
the fish@@ eries electric fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac was a picture taken place on the spot .
at the rec@@ lam@@ ination of the family of Schwen@@ demann , representatives of the CD@@ U city council met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann entered into its operation , in which he works 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young homes and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ed accommod@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , as sw@@ ing@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste only is regional .
since he is also the C@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit up on such steep sections .
the green area has a lot of work , much needs to be processed using the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have strug@@ gling with the conditions and to fight with the top photography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sized off &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ic@@ able operation and manage this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it lead no bio@@ operation .
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the Leader promotion . &quot;
farmers need to be supported at costs between 3000 and 4000 Euros per hectare .
we hope that , so that the refresh@@ ment of the faces could go out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their farm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in the criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open @-@ based surface is 40 hectares , which can not be en@@ for@@ ated by at least 20@@ 23 .
a quarter of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by the total of EUR 71 and a quarter carried by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers stay 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained an@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmer and women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White resi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state community line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of Wei@@ de@@ c@@ ences .
the aim is the opening of the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn conveyor drop .
furthermore , the in@@ consistency area must not be drag@@ ged ( hang@@ ar above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the refresh@@ ment .
currently , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a fence of 16 kilometres on the fence .
the conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change @-@ up , it is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciated this as well as any other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s disappearance on the Fir@@ dos village in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , did certainly know what he did when he had a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN on the proposals of the President to dra@@ stic immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not take the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have felt him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta imp@@ lied : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correct but how he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it concerns the contemporary response to the sha@@ king words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only include any ancient immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your rub@@ ble , your poor , and your oppressed masses , looking for free , / the end of your rich coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ e@@ tr@@ ash &quot; was to be seen better on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criti@@ que - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps America .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down in order to place her words after her death on the basis - knew quite good that they had completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by showing the femin@@ ine car@@ ess of freedom in a worn classical representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the coupling with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change this back long by the right wing .
the great shout of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not in fact , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative that the American flame has to present into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding .
it should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch shall not shine on the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is down here on something .
the importance of the statue is wholly or even a question of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see how she was seen of the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear .
and this is not the perspective of creating Miller and Tr@@ ump ever .
her torch shall not shine on the way , but the hatred , who is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain
Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds himself of a while when only two mar@@ ries belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the performance director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ person Scottish cont@@ ingent quota will contribute to a solid contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland , something special &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find out until we find out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of things is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m track , while Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to team mates .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ ie is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that Ei@@ li@@ ie entirely restored , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sc@@ ot@@ tos in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir lead on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will be part of 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gr@@ otto that one is looking for a great season to watch the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembers their first world championships , as the only other gr@@ otto in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the management capit@@ alists states that they &quot; enorm@@ ously pro@@ ud@@ ly &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only to the team , but in some cases also in the medals and with the fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about it is to be the team that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates have voted for me and voted , makes it something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dies .
what my speech concerns as a capitalist ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
so , it is really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and there will be a great atmosphere as out there . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not throw yourself a public office if you do not wear the heat of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of the domestic policy up to its political principles .
he imp@@ lies with the criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken from - and , dum@@ b and mute , we are led to the sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland at Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted the opinions on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union mourned for him in the early days of this week .
the governor of the Govern@@ ors rejected the law@@ suit as a vol@@ vol@@ ution , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence of principles .
it was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters , and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons appearing on the side of the govern@@ ance - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary , and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ ess &apos;s spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ ance and argued that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the picture of tro@@ mb@@ als or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ aul@@ ted people who make search the whi@@ p .
the Post said with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , re@@ thinking , and not prof@@ essed .
the pastor wrote the Bible in his post and appealed to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ ayed , but she asked to hate him .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other new messages , &quot; she wrote in the comment area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people in the same theme takes place , then they are dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called &quot; collective &quot; and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pron@@ unci@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to assign a message by simply plug@@ ged into a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn with critical cuts and to stick or to sweat or to sweat .
but exactly that has just happened .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that critic@@ ised for this , that he imp@@ lies Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County violated the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a voters from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter driver beat his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised his position about the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med their ministry , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
free speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to our nation &apos;s basis .
and true leader means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of home comforts , since the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the links to the final round in the past year before he lost up to Paul E@@ ales , has been united with the new venue and act as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a eager supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time even though he has won his 32 @-@ year career with both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly in , &quot; said the player in South@@ port , located in the port of South@@ port .
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken in the year after I won them from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always be appreciated . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on homeland .
this event will be the first Scottish show since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more if you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel the additional pressure too .
I really enjoyed it to play again , and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how to go there . &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ d .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce includes six competitions on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 a car with two or more in@@ mates .
all proceeds from Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoke
over the past two decades , less people are dying due to passi@@ vity from lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estim@@ ations , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he attained a dedicated study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passi@@ v@@ smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove itself as very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work on Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moder@@ ately in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected since there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noticeable in the plans .
the traffic , which hin@@ dered the construction work again , represents a big problem for the under@@ growth of the firm St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance driver in front of red traffic and bul@@ locks is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she does not use stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife typically puts a sweet potato h@@ is@@ ite - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the knot@@ ted scar@@ f is taken out of di@@ ligent , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture , where she also leaves her daily work , e.g. dresses with fro@@ sted water out of the nearby S@@ ands .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , you were not assigned their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around in the village at 17 o &apos;clock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into everyday life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken after a controversial referendum in Indonesia in 1969 , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were killed by a public eye li@@ ft@@ ment before the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal affairs .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo sticks , and out of corrugated cardboard , which were converted to various yellow tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , sof@@ ten journalists , and practically no foreigners .
before Christian Mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans became a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to bear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i and imp@@ lies on their bu@@ zz , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , its dar@@ ker shirt and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in earlier we had only leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the Indonesian province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates and alpha@@ bet rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia of Indonesia .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , an inland province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua contains wooden resources worth $ 78 billion worth of estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia is preser@@ ving a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a report from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Author@@ ities and Units from 1998 to 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ rop@@ claims after bigger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden sp@@ ans and are treated with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned .
massacres of par@@ u@@ as in Pap@@ u@@ as in the 1970 @-@ s were made to genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peac@@ efully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All Calcul@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is contained in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Brisbane in 2016 , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are especially popular - and brutal defeat in peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts are reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as Resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ es@@ ian War@@ ung Cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ us@@ au@@ ce served .
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables from traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local who went to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local Pap@@ ua - the m@@ om m@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - have cost their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , also known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle the ine@@ qualities and the law ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed a little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we tuned in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children said to them , that they should place their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers went on to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , and pursued the group with their guns , spake sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers hum@@ id into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ um@@ o , was so difficult that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set al@@ ight , and the situation escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
it was carried away to sm@@ em@@ ated fighters and led the Vau@@ d dance - in the circle and a bird ha@@ iling - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to s@@ wap stones on police and military posts .
when the senti@@ ment was heated , the soldiers was sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses did more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it was not released in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ oping danger and called for peace , and called for the multitude to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned myself , I was suddenly shot in my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who being fired , but says that the ball from the ranks of the soldiers were gathered .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and enter@@ tain his body to be sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries just a name like many Indones@@ ians , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese police spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repe@@ ats that his officers wanted to secure their station &quot; only &quot; because they would be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many more wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; filtered it to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and s@@ ware to tackle the historical mis@@ eries in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case is immediately solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Security Council of Security Wir@@ anto said that he would judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism to the state of historic human rights violations .
but the failure began almost immediately .
&quot; the majority of the injuries occ@@ ured long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these bre@@ aches , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat than he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who demanded the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence voting in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai suburbs .
in the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims , these alleg@@ ations were contrary to an in@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , to be shot dead . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in panic have fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the army , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the dead bodies , the army sought me for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting conditions have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location firm .
the police told that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , re@@ acted by ref@@ using warning shots .
the locals said that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there &apos;s reven@@ ge will be , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who was living in the proximity of the hospital and was a witness to the landlord here , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to draw the officers to account and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident in the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the satisfaction of the family @-@ related Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , strug@@ gling with spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PD leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya , Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to these years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and were arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; ensuring national sovereignty . &quot;
some people never appear again .
under the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , forgotten place .
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is the same but range .
the people here build everything that they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf b@@ ins .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of fresh potato .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian Ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the period , economic disp@@ arities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new flooding at the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers .
the few work stations that exist in the region are usually reminiscent of the better trained and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of the coverage of international media are ten@@ se .
in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of the lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the movies .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign campaigns were able to raise limitations on reporting to promote transparency and development , not implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report the Indonesian un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : vis@@ as , and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , N@@ au@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Solomon Rights Council on the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the involvement of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to rape the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
the people imagine that more foreign governments are aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ hand ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and thron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but kept anonymous .
Indonesia has opened a new presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ tan .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai foam , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the council .
he wants j@@ ok@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people knows that it lives under the permanent threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ian military , is located in im@@ pover@@ ished educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , will consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of thre@@ ats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the pan@@ i@@ ai shot led a last symbolic act of faith : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a terrain opposite the police and the military station .
they may not know , but at least they don &apos;t forget to surrender their crimes , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthy head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai to its en@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 m heighted , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that lies in just two years through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is by acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we slept with the fire al@@ arms and at the scre@@ aming of people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; there was a resident who calls his name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Ci@@ vi@@ lian Author@@ ities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool .
the government said they work on the provision of self @-@ catering flats .
the incident may ask questions about the security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study carried out by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the greatest part of damage caused by the covering , the external cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels to isol@@ ate and covering at the London Gren@@ ad@@ di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that died about 80 people .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , it was intended to play for this sport revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup single , only to play two @-@ thirds , and is not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although the most often very long but also very well known five @-@ set classic will remain the traditional way to the traditional way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member states do not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ con@@ ian and historical events , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the suggest@@ ion had come to fill the final at a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to host the host in the next round in the first round .
to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in matters will need training places , etc . , and players will need to complete less official media dates in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. trav@@ ellers bring down objects to the plane , there is a survey
a survey carried out under flight connections revealed that over 20 percent of China &apos;s security security have been deliber@@ ately passed on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while they were acci@@ dentally powered knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they would have discovered that they had traveled ir@@ reversible with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , and also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers seem to dis@@ regard the rules .
of the surveyed said they were knowing that they were able to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of the mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the Generation X were .
the most common items that have passed on T@@ SA agents are intenti@@ onally tow@@ ed , foods and liquids were used .
more than 3 percent showed , knowing items in blades carried by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed confirmed that they were intenti@@ onally banned drugs into the airplane .
the company said that travelers were interviewed in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged goods have been carried out through the airport security and how many things they have done .
it is no surprise that people who are on the most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ knowing - those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company pointed out that T@@ SA guidelines are something complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ ure what liquids can carry them away , or how much .
so , it is not a surprise that the greatest amount of fluids in the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects .
for a time the people thought that T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k has no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ clients &quot; Order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k will enjoy the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
to date , he has so far failed that some of the customers have withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ing figures for sales increases and more gigantic targets , Tesla @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k , for the first time , announces the release of the latest quarter@@ ly account for the first time : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often applied for the new car in recent months with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car .
therefore Mus@@ k was trying : out of the 5@@ 18.000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always have noted that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla is pay@@ ed the € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
at the moment 45@@ 5.000 such non @-@ binding reservations are registered , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of some 12 percent of all orders have to be solved so far , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument is : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles in the past year .
in 2018 it is supposed to have taken together all models - 500.000 , one million by 2020 .
demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently made .
if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you may expect delivery to be delivered in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla created it to drive its brand new , never in practice , without greater interrup@@ tions , with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts predi@@ ct that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , the ability of reservations could be Tesla for Tesla .
because then , the company cannot come up with satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions because of the execution of the Rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew its former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g caused air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities against re@@ ac@@ tional more than previous administ@@ r@@ ations .
he did not mentioned the complaint against his previous place in a federal state of profession .
it is about a period that ran off on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for the under@@ floor zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have to do a year in order to study the plan more time to study the plan and avoid growth , &quot; to inter@@ fere with local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a very reliable enemy more stringent environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regul@@ ating or delayed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change of Wednesday is the most recent legal return to the P@@ ru@@ sion regular roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court has decided that the EPA administrator did not exceed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reducing methane de@@ cks to delay .
in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt presented that his revers@@ al of Oz@@ on@@ standard is simply the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of justi@@ fying the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administ@@ r@@ ations , the EPA often did not meet the dead@@ lines for performing and then waited , of activists and others to be tried , and in an agreement an agreement for the execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in the case of jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the Law and authority that exists to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ suffered its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awareness of the delay and all others are legally binding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress pushing a more comprehensive revised version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the final month of appro@@ vals , the implementation of the Rules of 2015 shall be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set to vote in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric C@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , who had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , the group stated to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and more than 115 million Americans that are directly related to Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schneider &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying how much pressure is needed to receive this reasonable step of the responsible for the protection of the air we in@@ hale , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 am invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade .

the salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and supporters of the tum@@ ours for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chapel was mentioned in documents for the first time mentioned in the Wür@@ ttem@@ bür@@ g@@ ian Order &apos;s documents , Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , with the sigh@@ ting of the Fle@@ et Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the word , the Word was standing on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , beside the former parish church , belonged to the church or the patron of the patron , and not vice versa .
so there were people living there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as of the description of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freuden@@ stadt @-@ 1858 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; description , next to the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the area of Tum@@ ors , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the village , the village of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 are the historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early medieval suit@@ case .
one Lord , who built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained his owner of this Church and also he was able to inherit these pec@@ uli@@ arities .
thus , the right to use a priest or to add a new parish to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger one of the two breaks on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell stopped for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the window pan@@ es were stolen and the bel@@ fry pieces were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
1796 the French troops landed in the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and n@@ aves , and used them as a fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened by 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from au@@ wel@@ ers .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us church was demolished .
only the bell tower was standing .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm broke the steep@@ le and the half collapsed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only today the tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .

Club wants to test permission from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim refused &quot; is not a legal foundation for the construction and has therefore turned into the Council of the Council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim refused &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andrew Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to re@@ use its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Vier@@ sen , there is a wind power concentration camp at the time of Vier@@ sen .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone does not include exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; recovery &quot; of the landscape .
although the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , a few days earlier , however , the District government of Düsseldorf had not been approved because of a mold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning regulations , the approval decision is un@@ lawful for the decision to be left un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council once again decided the wind con@@ centric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , an author@@ ization of the District government is still available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the division of author@@ ization for the establishment of wind energy systems plan@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the input of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re@@ consider the matter .
however , they do not represent that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view of the current trial at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle was unable to express itself on Thursday with regard to the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning on an area of four meters high wind turbines on an area of Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
in the past year the company had already been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved in which P@@ acht@@ al contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares were closed .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power demand of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the power demand of all four households .
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave green light to purchase three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ nich in Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district .
car and tractor together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning around 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between low @-@ wall@@ men@@ ub@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was wounded in the process .
two other people were seriously wounded .
the country road was closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich entered her passenger car with her 53 year old mother as a companion to the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ ders &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops within the city center in September .
the business park and the city authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to attract residents for shopping tours to the city centre .
as Chairman of the profession of profession , Christian König , announced that the &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customers for it , which offers its own city on the usual market of supermarket .
it is planned to be a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
local companies will also present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to be loaded up to the &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
yet , the action is not only for residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation for advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the editing weekend , then Christian König .
municipal administration and business park are collabor@@ ating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
as a result , the commercial Club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive City . &quot;
these include new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , together with the so@@ ff@@ ened Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment park charges on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer @-@ potential customers are supposed to be re@@ opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
at the end all of them will help to revi@@ ve the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that had a wider range , the king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of the HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thurin@@ gian towns were participating in the nationwide &quot; home shopping centre &quot; for the first time in five Thurin@@ gian towns .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , you are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ ja , Heiligen@@ stadt and ble@@ ach ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its importance to the community of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the lead of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment by itself .
two dead and more wounded after explosion at US school
during the construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .

tr@@ ump placed after secured tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the limit wall
tran@@ scripts of phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President imp@@ lied him because he den@@ ounces the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; We cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started out his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and swore that Mexico had to pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull was also published and revealed an appealing exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said that a trade for the United States of refugees who immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call , after he had told Mr. Turn@@ Bull , &quot; that is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford &apos;s massacre : activists perform r@@ assi@@ stic Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and had shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man @-@ aged man in a needle strike - took a long turn in his cig@@ ar and looked round through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -@@ r Roger ! &quot; she cri@@ es .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es out of the silence , as a young man of young man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
lu@@ ck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them had very real diseases in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights for Moore &apos;s Ford bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ speak@@ able that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we know them in our commun@@ es , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who assi@@ sts in the organization of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia for Georgia and a civil war .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice was never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to have healing , we want to be reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to heal and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial commentary on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ a , on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI files , that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , people say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the entire city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice gave the black citizens to Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer .
at the same time as the election st@@ ach , according to the FBI , the black colour but@@ cher Roger Mal@@ com settled a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby , which she had , was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white estate owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and their cou@@ sins Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they came to the prison , then the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge set closer , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring around the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it arises , it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes a FBI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law en@@ forcement , which was not only involved in the killing , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
bro@@ oks formul@@ ates it even more impressive .
&quot; it was a right to vote , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you agree and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ order of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that it is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne because we are confronted with all the appe@@ ti@@ bility in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish my relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day there were almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black - in a room and l@@ ous@@ ed when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chef C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said that it will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story of life because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room we tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester cried and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ ang@@ er@@ wi@@ den the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the most difficult .
&quot; what ? ! ! , &quot; An@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people were &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; n &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in space , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there is cri@@ es , nuts and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads to cheap holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice declares at every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of around four dozen people caught silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , in order to see the performance , many of them just come down the road .
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as cru@@ ising moisture for nearly eight hours , when bro@@ oks they run on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ c@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
if the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the bodies .
children ho@@ cks to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mur@@ ders a little boy , as if he would like to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene of the quantity - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ s@@ eil away and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ ho@@ en@@ ar@@ chs two of his players and then she cri@@ es in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance ultimately breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; says one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience puts together with the actors to dinner together .
on a table a white pair of Atlanta is excited about the im@@ position with a black pair , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which has to leave the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who like to look and do that because they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does this mean to me , I believe that the Lyn@@ ne is still going forward &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police sh@@ elling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks yard lasts at his table , he eat@@ eth and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reference is inspired in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not know his own story , he who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconciled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , Director Frank Cast@@ at puts on a colourful , high @-@ strength st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ storey back@@ drop .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optional road corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ stics and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car in which the Rhine @-@ Class cars will pose a rock @-@ girls or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
the fo@@ iled oil tan@@ kers remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs conduc@@ tivity - money , power and gre@@ ed - which draws up by his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine Falls - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ se@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , gr@@ ind in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a body in the trunk and give the ri@@ ot cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious fi@@ bro@@ us Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight holder .
brutal the scene when he kill@@ eth Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
in stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , is celebrated in a modest and wor@@ sen@@ ing hands to the Merkel Rau@@ te .
there is great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra which first shows on stage - in view of the big heat again in empty leisure clothing .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ el and his Reg@@ i@@ et@@ eam label with tension .
in 2013 he had to leave a demonstration of the Pfei@@ f@@ le over himself , there were five years later , in which the sol@@ itary &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about that .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ or , but it is also an understanding of its visibility .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunteer year right at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture train , once a week I can save here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
how are your experiences with that ?
a lot : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
now they are 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made high school education .
and then , a civil engineering , we say , successfully stopped .
I knew for me that it is Fal@@ se for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what you do .
do a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see as it is on site , in focal point perhaps too , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social situation .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , do a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it will always be on it , where you will be FS@@ J .
you can do it from age @-@ home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also part of the O@@ gs , i.e. in the afternoon care .
for me , this was just the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it is not about to expect statistics .
they always have other people in front of their own head , each with a completely different story .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , has been brought out of the family - you always have to go individually .
very interesting .
and you don &apos;t have any contact troubles ?
quantity : for that I am not the guy .
there is a range that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also sometimes negative moments , but so life is just this way .

EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay the government regulation of Obama , revers@@ ed that the states are obliged to em@@ ulate the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late in Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and hereby we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ ddy had announced in June the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , to establish where sub@@ sections need to be made to comply with higher quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit against the Tuesday , and said that the effort is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental regulations , which was imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that would boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the back of the demo@@ crats and biological reserves , concerns concerns about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hale of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , &quot; and the respiratory symptoms can enhance &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal council aims to concern
at the end , the decision was made clear : in case two counter@@ parts , the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ alty decides to set up the establishment of a community living in the future retirement residence .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still lack of land was signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to take it until the Church of church belonging to the church , however , there is no planning event for the project to st@@ em@@ ulate a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would have a living space - around 55 square meters - and a adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council is before , such a common room just as the meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ic living room , but open to the church .
for example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision made by the provision of funding for the current household have already been decided in autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a joint area would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden reported , with 60 per cent of a 30 percent stake .
the decision to show that no b@@ ill@@ ets can be put between the legs in this regard , that in this regard , no b@@ ill@@ ets wants to throw from the legs - as well as a roof @-@ height - what reduces water level and construction of economic power - they would be possible .
unnecessary , that doesn &apos;t only mean Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanimously , he happens the board .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call to the many own buildings with which one is not getting ready for it , but they rest now in common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so difficult to do so . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne State is absolutely talking to the community space - but absolutely against a communist participation .
it also sees a covered sub @-@ payout in any@@ ways or any foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give a grant , but I get a real value worth in a doubt that is the counter @-@ speaking .
on request , Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to apply the decision to apply three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
thus with two counter@@ parts at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller has thus summar@@ ised , &quot; If we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a giant , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z of Star
in Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; star@@ ry ad &quot; will be created .
this plans of the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; to meet the information needs of many resin visitors , it was named .
he exclu@@ de nature , science , movement , and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route tablets and inform them about stars and constellation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase up to 2018 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ automated installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ question come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the sheets are to be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
this is why the site selection has a good mobile network reception .
also accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; the viewer sees a great deal worth knowing , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
moreover , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star ligh@@ tened more than another , although it was much more distant .
also con@@ veys , in which constellation is to find a selected star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , located at the highest point in northern Germany since 2014 .
the location of the National Park of Har@@ z , according to information from the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way galaxy and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy is clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to Planet@@ arium &apos;s initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Islands - the planet &apos;s planet .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Equ@@ al ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the single planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately placed in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter while the sun measures 70 centimet@@ res standing at exactly 75 meters away .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light is required from the sun to the Plu@@ to approximately eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would last a half a year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ah@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia should be in a coll@@ ision course to set up the most exciting box@@ ing combat in the near future below 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia the failed World box@@ ing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion went down to welcoming Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion .
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ conductor world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday to show time , both fighters are members of the top five P@@ ound @-@ for P@@ ound list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he stretched out his right hand , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it you champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ah@@ enko defended his gir@@ dle against Miguel put away on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
as the pair for photographs pos@@ ited , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters &quot; would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather of fe@@ ather , &quot; reminded Garcia .
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to be downloaded to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and we fight .
they ask for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko approved .
&quot; box@@ ing needs to fight this fight . &quot;
the climate asked if it was to fight at pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight at the next summer with Garcia one date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 bone b@@ outs ) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and she pushed back openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other name can produce this type of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
he said , he insi@@ sted Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous com@@ bat@@ ants , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday @-@ battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought at the generous praise of Garcia , and said that he was thinking of the Tri@@ une Champion of Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry for the K@@ o @-@ Aus . &quot;
he said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum , feeling for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the struggle to be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have waited for the top @-@ com@@ bat@@ ants , and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four last conver@@ ters to the tyre board
during an accident on the A7 motorway , four people were seriously wounded in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 shortly before the connecting station market is probably to control the control of its vehicle .
the passenger cars moved to the right into the ar@@ u@@ ation , where he turned over and then stuck on the roof of the ridge .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service the A7 toward the north for about an hour was blocked , then the traffic on the left chassis could be guided by the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; shooting chain is better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er against Braunschweig , so that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points will bring points .
with the first win of the season , And@@ re Hoffmann was happy with the result , because there was not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotary chain should also be optimized .
and a gate after a fre@@ ak will not want to catch their re@@ ins even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes better in preparation with the tor@@ sional chain better than with the quad@@ ron chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ y , but Hoffmann is his matter safely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we &apos;ve just got to build on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a requirement for us , but that we can do even better , and we cannot afford a lot of ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you &apos;ve decided to talk to a mis@@ erable start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points , we will surely be able to concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly be able to talk of a special season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Radio , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony had to be interrupted due to a temp@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ y and Hoffmann believes that the players from auction might be even more fr@@ ying , as they couldn &apos;t have heavier and complete game like Fort@@ una for a rise in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhineland &quot; make a slight favorite on Sunday into the meeting at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we may feed them , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is blocks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ body , whose balance is quite positive in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to hit from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas boss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet such statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and super@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ body doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of all tested people are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( F@@ os@@ medi@@ al ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they are to take a closer assessment of the ages during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ rant authorities ( migration breakdown ) were critic@@ ised because of errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , migrants ha@@ iled 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is asked to question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly increasing during the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years means does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose to &quot; the susp@@ ect person 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , made by the cor@@ onation of wisdom teeth and MR@@ T photographs of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a Sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went early or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to assess this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ s@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , in this case , this figure is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full of plan
work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of concrete concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern region of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it is running super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction manager at the Department of Transport and Traffic in the governing committee in Freiburg .
in April , work began at the same time on all three san@@ iti@@ oned bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge built with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , she has now come to the years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure stability and transport security , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now reached a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
this is a mar@@ g@@ inal attachment , which is also used as a operating way .
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian is to run .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .
special finger@@ tip has the laying of lines due to the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected .
residents were kept informed by hand@@ writing through the project on the eve of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be swept out .
for the bridges , between the construction building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher outskirts , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed .
the costs for the three bridges are 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in German potato salad
it &apos;s not so often that parties move on a strand , but if it comes to Germany &apos;s alternative to Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat .
the party represented in the chal@@ k Vol@@ can@@ on Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance , which indicates that day the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites for a poster called &quot; Great Ele@@ ctor open@@ ers &quot; .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Director of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic is planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers themselves .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the For@@ ums A World and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green potato salad which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence also in the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes recorded by the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ opy , he has endeav@@ oured to get to such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ s@@ dorf initially demanded in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there is not enough parking spaces available .
well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he tells a look at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good law of the people , the cause , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an area provides a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young .
in the hall , there are about 200 listen@@ ers to wait for the general election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy General of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence has remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the pre@@ site have a longer breath , but also there is a stop after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move back - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one hits trumpet
a song with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is available in the Series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ ts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the convent church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in the bel@@ lows .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international cont@@ ests and have a position of Sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European top orchestra .
thus , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is located at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i , the SWR Symphony Orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both of them uni@@ fies the lust , not only to exceed the limits of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach joins the two as in a new clothes , Daniel Car@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical music , jazz and the free games to a fascinating complete art work .
this core piece of the program was premiered in the spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ itt was specifically written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher convent church with its special A@@ cou@@ stics is conscious of the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people like gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try out everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Stewart &quot; openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a gr@@ illed cheese once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the one of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went out bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all , the brun@@ ette performer facing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I have changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten was telling her that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always lived du@@ alism and really believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or disabled .
I had never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them I have suffered &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , as she dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this is really hurt .
when I was eleven , the children said I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and embar@@ r@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and remember me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public , they don &apos;t like to tell their love life : &quot; people expect you to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps I may design@@ ate me some as ung@@ rat@@ eful but I don &apos;t like it to justify me before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Wednesday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats got away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump missed a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a carbon store by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave a declaration in which it said : &quot; party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather be working as to work for our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the f@@ ew@@ est of the f@@ law in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last ref@@ usal of a party that is not able to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news .
CO@@ E commends &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of the Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a manifest exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken up again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Group CEO D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the federation of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) not@@ ices of state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will begin to compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , on Friday in London , in accordance with the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a recovery .
drug tests are still insufficient and in@@ sufficiently active . he said rep@@ lication in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
fun@@ eral act for Mali killed in Mali
at a fun@@ eral service in the north @-@ h@@ edi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister for Defense Minister Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
they called the two umbi@@ li@@ fied pilots , but as a &quot; cor@@ onation of her expert . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we incline us before this highest sacrifice , which they offered in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff retired from Northern Ireland were killed on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their wor@@ ries were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a tot@@ ality of the Armed Forces in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives participated in the Church .
after that , the fun@@ eral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the army and politics began .
there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ torate of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the grape harvest laid down ro@@ ses , and the other hand had arm in arm to the S@@ är@@ gen .
before the Church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers fell on a canvas in front of the church .
the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen have described the ri@@ fied soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and en@@ cir@@ cled .
the staff owner has built the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ lau@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , said to which the soldiers belong , &quot; If these crew didn &apos;t turn down the crash , nobody would have disappeared . &quot;
in doubt , there was no doubt about the UN mission in Mali : there is no doubt that the government was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the S@@ är@@ ge was brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no details .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife beside his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral &apos;s cathedral in Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard completed a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the queen may agree with the decision of her husband , he named it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a meal that he was not happy with his title .
he would have been the King after the succession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired to reti@@ re and also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ ing . &quot;
as Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function , he didn &apos;t want to see himself against his wife , not as equal to death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by stated that he was the chief speaker of the Danish Royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old ultimately became still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French native country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
born in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , a son of a French arist@@ ocracy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the symptoms always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old rules for the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did is critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk t@@ aps instead of sn@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ge , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , and the researchers in this country had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope in the sight .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and will not be ashamed .
these were the same two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister , Weil wants to re @-@ fix re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
the prime minister of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is attributed to the loss of red @-@ green government multip@@ licity for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was said to be on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising departure of a Green Party from its Land@@ tag in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code lost the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover for its almost one @-@ vote majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ KA founded its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Chief of Staff Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship had been revers@@ ed .
the new day of Land@@ tag will be elected for the next year on January 14th .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they would continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil keeps it indispensable for ever , that the land @-@ day would rapidly choose his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the governor &apos;s day of the Prime Minister keeps confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be quiet in tranquility , if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West @-@ Step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a bit cur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political scientist himself stressed : &quot; I am not a judge .
I feel very good . &quot;
they called itself as a tra@@ des from black @-@ green .
the Green Party demanded the ab@@ duc@@ ted dep@@ uties on the return of their country &apos;s day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course going out that she has received their country house that gives them back over the green list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry for the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no differences of differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemned the over@@ comes of the lower Saxon Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ons to the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bund@@ esch@@ ef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he re@@ signs the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ start the land day quickly .
the Austr@@ o @-@ green will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her Fr@@ ust her personal interests in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ation game and tries to beat out the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
objec@@ tivity , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recru@@ it his M@@ EPs , El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the west before , with Personal Car@@ ri@@ er@@ ed@@ ding the result of the election election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD , the SPD and the Green Party had a small majority in the land before the SPD .
the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect against poison , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing in@@ fest@@ ed eggs .
how did the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumers protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Minister for Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the sten@@ cil printer .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though after all , we are currently aware that health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
now Al@@ di now takes over the best crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture will not be perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately , and since the announcement of the subject of Germany in a close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all the information and risk assessment are accessible to consumers .
trade has the same way as the manufacturers ensure that the selling products and health are un@@ think@@ able .
if eggs in the back@@ drop level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exceeded , they are not traffic @-@ capable .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time , the establishments are not to blame .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after that pass@@ words , the production plants meets no immediate debt .
rather , it must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of services .
as always , there is a little controllers in the harvest .
is it missing only on the personnel or on the main jurisdiction ?
however , there were just the official controls which have uncovered the procedure .
however , for the truth , however , food@@ stu@@ ffs and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
just this is a consistent education of such events and hand@@ over to the state agencies in the cases where offen@@ ders can be submitted , of decisive importance .
I have already made several times , that I expect a l@@ us@@ eless ligh@@ ten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm device really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get solely safe and transport @-@ capable foods .
when an in@@ authorised in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are to be received .
through the driven resources , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
principle must be clear : the illegal use of the in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ offering animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately .
it must be consistently working on all levels and work with high pressure .
I am expected from all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact will be dra@@ fted and un@@ locked .
how the financial rules of the football ball on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted issues of the European football matches will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA UEF@@ I , for the leading organization that the European game supervised the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) in order to buy the Brazi@@ lians out of his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loosely , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ takes and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich ruler of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must communicate with legitim@@ ise dispos@@ ition sources that allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA Presidential president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had their success in their quest to success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ently conce@@ aled and ris@@ ked to ruin , if banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration to liabilities of the club to monitoring their losses .
the amendment meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch was originally purchased in Chelsea - a club with potential , and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to be a harder matter .
for the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P processing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take up to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , its UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be afraid of leaving excessive output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with the Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package deal , it can distribute the amount of the invoice over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a half year contract , so that the redemption price for the next five years can be reached in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ lists their financial support by adding up their income by companies that are linked to owners of a club .
while a cataly@@ tic company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should not exceed the default market rates , the UEFA EURO will not apply as legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA of Qatar was initiated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar will come to Qatar over the payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be easy to find out a big maneu@@ ver for the UEFA Champions authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA still is to be attentive to note the rules of the audience .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said the people that are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports published that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 5@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive to a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League had clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s trail by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a cle@@ arer case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , Spanish daily AS in terms of cat@@ ars , last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that co @-@ financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of the football ball in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a land has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
for the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y onboard chocolate has been produced for Swiss Life .
now , the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline makes the job new .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the News Agency S@@ DA a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current plans , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed and subjected to a quality control every two to three years .
&quot; we are very happy with the current vend@@ or supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red packed sh@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ ers are distributed to 14 grams per year . the flight att@@ endant before landing to passengers .
Swiss does not want to make any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ der estimate the total order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the M@@ IG@@ RO@@ S subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but important is the advertising effect : for a jo@@ g producer , it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants will give it to the new call , the Swiss don &apos;t want to betray the Swiss franc .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .

field Ath@@ le@@ tics - Dis@@ co @-@ Olympi@@ ad Robert Hart@@ ing reaches the World Cup final
the three @-@ month world champion is fighting a medal in the final on Saturday .
his brother Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , was failed in the National World Championships and was able to watch the flo@@ ppy competition only from the grand@@ stand .
also with the first attempt , the Polish tit@@ le@@ holder Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ag@@ owski , who threw himself for the final fight for the final battle of 6@@ 5,@@ 13 meters .
no@@ stal@@ gia is going into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche .
this repet@@ ition of the story is no@@ stal@@ gic due to the glorious day of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to major things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but when fran@@ chise it feels , then the time would be short .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its lack of hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for the speaking of the vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by looking at the core of the flags - actor middle ages play g@@ aps children , which are grown up - yet , they only create the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotional roots and its par@@ ody gets more after the gig principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( The hand that cra@@ ck the cra@@ dle ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point , a character is named by Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has never lost its vir@@ gin@@ ity forever .
and there is another crazy plot that is included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ tras are the best part of the Franchise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d who plays Matt D@@ avi@@ lions &quot; sta@@ che of &quot; singles &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old h@@ acker .
these are the moments of random not@@ ion that could heat this fran@@ chise , as a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches the band as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of the form of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his east @-@ against @-@ West ring attack .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created a comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the path of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main role - a hard fleet Gregor and an ide@@ alistic h@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ ues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to look ( the police force the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ per@@ ately propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask , is involved - that it is often as one player .
with six long episodes , it goes on and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been reduced to a lower length , could visit its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re , as Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef has always occupied the American embassy that always occupied by two thick men who swal@@ low a he@@ aps of Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can do everything to feed .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own younger history and ours .
blow against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for how the public prosecutor &apos;s office was on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 certificates were arrested for the age of 25 and 77 , and warran@@ ts issued warran@@ ts of arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials presented larger amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are likely to be delivered to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were used in total .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and supp@@ ression .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office against organised drug traffi@@ cking was established in southern Germany .
between the state agencies in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
hence the big application was accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the visor of the investigations , some of all Italian national associated with respect to Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , during which several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , is likely to go to the band &apos;s account .
how to compl@@ ain large g@@ aps in the foreigner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who are not to emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners regi@@ sters in Germany show considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious fail@@ ures for asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has reportedly made attention to a media report in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ Central Registry .
with asylum procedures , asylum procedures could lead to partly serious fail@@ ures , &quot; in a manner in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; exists .
according to the data , ten million people are recorded by foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data was not sufficiently cared for , the data quality in parts has not been well so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer on life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and in fact no longer be able to emerge . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data collected may be considerably slow , &quot; says the report to the previous report .
in statistics , over out@@ ep@@ her@@ ent people are covered by the EU citizen who would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such a wrong co @-@ ordin@@ ance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a dist@@ orted debate on the handling of women &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously began to return refugee families with under 16 year old children to return to Italy if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New &quot; &quot; New Years &quot; Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures for families with children , except for infants and young children - in Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation was on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state may return it back to the travel destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , this article write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increases substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy I left warran@@ ties for the recording and accomodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) keep this commitment for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inside of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children arise because of the defic@@ ien@@ cies in an Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood living in Ober@@ rei@@ den@@ bach has already been provided for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
he is going to know Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile distributed 100 litres of blood with its meanwhile 100 million donations .
traditionally , the community has traditionally claimed multiple will@@ ingness to donate the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is gen@@ ius , as our bodies are created for it , and we will respect the don@@ or respect , which you provide blood for strangers , with the Mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood@@ stream helps several people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circul@@ atory leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , since preser@@ ves are broken into its constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that are carried out in the spring of Ober@@ mat@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 spins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DR@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coordin@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the Theat@@ erhaus has led to higher number of participants within a few years .
prior to the time , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Scho@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ ens were awarded the annual blood don@@ ors for each 50 .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slow@@ down of inflation would have fought spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a steady pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) , the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.25 % , with this month less members met a rise , because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarter@@ ly inflation review , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and from 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would likely increase to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but they are sign@@ alized that in the coming years , interest rate would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation , and it said that the credit costs may be more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut economy package that was issued a year after the break .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide the funding for funding from the next February , although it is now expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds higher in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real@@ time of households remain in@@ crimin@@ ating consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be expected than markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step@@ wise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s projected growth progn@@ osis for this and next year , compared to the projected 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change is made after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rates have risen to rise in interest rates and has increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter although it is easy to recover from the Bank by the end of the year .
the most recent annual rate of inflation offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and mar@@ gins , as the dis@@ advantage is getting worse before it becomes improved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income of income in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that wages in the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will recover significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision returns a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ eral .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will achieve the prices and economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank at interest rates , the fame was increased after interest rate , as inflation increased the pressure on harsh budgets , with three political decision makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to put it back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its aims at the relation to their target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have a weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Black@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive more competitive , as the len@@ ders are seeking to end in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those with which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) Should Under@@ stand HIV @-@ Dro@@ ve 10,000 people
in September , following a fight against the drug in the N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevalence rate .
N@@ HS England admitted that one of the recorded pre@@ text phy@@ la@@ xis ( P@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk factors by around 86 percent , now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was ready to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court last year , according to that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
Thursday announced on Thursday he was welcomed by N@@ HS England &apos;s chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( N@@ AT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be eligible for people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ text phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission with infections .
p@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medic@@ ations can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question , belong or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants will agree to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner , whose presence of HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered at a dent@@ ist can also register for a potential participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines in this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by analy@@ zing clinical interest as well as in a large scale specifically designed and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complete the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in terms of one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at N@@ AT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the struggle against HIV .
pre@@ EP when it is targeted to needy and endangered people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ison@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine was created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow of health , said : &quot; the start of the P@@ EP process is due for months of delay and delay in implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dissemin@@ ation of HIV in society a step closer .
the big living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have changed this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ note with a passion for real estate , reduced to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 from a great house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has packed up their bags and sells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived with my Ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have made myself in love and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .
that was my requirements , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Architecture and Design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill who had 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative in order to solve the pre@@ ference .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked on each other without paying a g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just a simple platform to build , but to put the steel so that it had the right height at the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ der plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it for longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all best@@ ow and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
thanks to perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can connect the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to use , so if you push the door , it is very easy to guide . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make space for the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and they are helping to create an emotional relation in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electric sockets in the walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square footage of a little more standard into something completely nar@@ rative .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a meditation due to one of the largest real estate markets Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , valued at over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business can be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers received 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , gathered since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
the money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now covers offices in the city centre , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ bs as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - from Paul has described as &quot; main driver and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial acts indicate that Colin made his own value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved itself as a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those of Colin proposed resolutions have left him with the left which I thought for the best objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first sc@@ an@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attacks , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now struggle for control of the existing business , as Colin as Paul affir@@ med to be excluded .
Colin argued that it was not true , but raises Paul , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says that he would hope to conv@@ ene the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , P@@ it@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading legal lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and held by both sides .
Ms. De Luc@@ is and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and in the early se@@ venti@@ es bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin told that he began to West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years the High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to pass her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to end the brothers before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is company group , with Colin claimed that Mark during the leaving the company were paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Luke and Mark are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made herself back in Colin , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to compl@@ ain and compl@@ ain about the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would like to finish in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair is lo@@ osed from the dishes in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps of new staff plans to limit the media dis@@ st@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
politi@@ co reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ters Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first day of working with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps in white house that he wants to repair : bad information she is in the hands of the President .
Kelly said the employees that they should flow through it - whether on paper or let@@ tering - because the President would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to counter cad@@ res by super@@ vis@@ ing his media .
President Tr@@ umps on TV goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV coverage is still strong .
&quot; if the cont@@ ingent cont@@ ended due to un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he had received a fair reporting of places that were convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against politi@@ co .
Politi@@ ken Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it under control , is to make sure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ ster price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter has ever been under control &quot; is ri@@ di@@ culous .
perhaps this Kamp@@ er officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps is without their interventions could still contain more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the dr@@ ump is not sent .
if his staff might create it some times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tro@@ ut controversi@@ es .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that communic@@ ating from competing parties , always try to introduce their own agenda by promoting cad@@ ence material that may improve their views from the world .
politi@@ co - all with this story - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ing advis@@ ing the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example of reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it desc@@ ends to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February when someone willing to re@@ charge a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the Website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster to be at the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past , and ref@@ uted them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that be folded ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still seeking influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Master requested de@@ crimin@@ als get postal service by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and are hoping .
the police in all of Europe shipped this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the selected s@@ words are not known to be known , critics from the population are hoping and tested .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences could have shown that many volatile destinations in holiday destinations , it was named Euro@@ pol .
I compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there is the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ly , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online coun@@ ters have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
passengers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est living owners of West Mid@@ lands have come again with some terri@@ fied travelers on war , which have acted one of the indigenous tren@@ ches to withdraw a field in front of their houses .
trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have horses , babies , and an army of transportation , having been kicked out only in May , without being deported by a tren@@ ch out of the Council of excav@@ ated tren@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defensive systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
angry residents forced the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous citizen said : &quot; they arrived there on Monday evening after they were sent further by Bentley Heath , where they were cast stones onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action in fact , as he was us@@ eless as dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were in May there , have been moved and are now back again .
more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ mitt@@ ances in order to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am living at the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my local tax , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a people who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures show this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ s said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road , working together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps to move on as quickly as possible .
to support our we@@ iss@@ ance collection , it is very important that as many people are asked to report a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour during the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to prove when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house from the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently renovated and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the time of the company Bir@@ k@@ enhof from April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights spent per year and revenues by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in light of increasing numbers of refugees that came into the District , the hotel building was offered to the land office building as a collection accommodation , which led to controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers through the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but in particular , the Lord Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site , and he spoke to the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ausen with managing Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary sur@@ pass in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the Three @-@ Star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Gar@@ al@@ b .
your name is Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been placed before the entrance , and when you enter the house , what extensive renovation work will be made .
floors have been pulled out , ceilings to a part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large outdoor showers , the entrance to the entrance is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area , and a meeting room belongs to the facilities .
if one wanted to position themselves on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ se , but already on a higher city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are wide put forward , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual tourists , groups or business professionals are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are the same as the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also , the outdoor facilities are brought to front , that is clearly visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace , which is open to the public , will be open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : American Special Jury Com@@ mitted Grand Jury
in the Russia affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller shall have a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee in the last weeks started work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote under appeal to the thing known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CNN reported that it is already the first inv@@ itations of the board in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps &apos;s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted in the 2010 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were dis@@ agreements between Tr@@ umps Ele@@ ctor team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to act as an advisor to the re@@ public@@ ers of the Republi@@ can .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a private and more bol@@ dly private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump personally put into the center and search the accus@@ ation if the president may have disabled the justice in the course of the affair .
the main outcome of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide evidence of evidence of evidence and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore called Pro@@ secution .
mostly they are turned on when larger and controversial cases are held .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to accept persons under oath .
according to the CNN , CNN have already been exposed to inv@@ itations to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r , Tr@@ umps consultants and law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging election of Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in conversation with the conversation .
right @-@ wing professionals said on Thursday night in the US television that the objection may show that Mu@@ eller should not leave in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it is not necessary that the Grand Jury will be on on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the creation of the Gre@@ at@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president took a speech in West Virginia in order to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme give the demo@@ crats an opportunity to feel good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t have anything else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he did not know anything about the replacement of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in sec@@ rec@@ y , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the special issue on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be opposed to the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in mind , it was said in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this accus@@ ation , charges against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he has disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to ask an attitude to the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under huge pressure because of the investigation .
after the production of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its employees .
the spec@@ ulation spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be dismissed .
unlike an independent special issue of Congress as in the Water@@ gate affair around the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller did a position in which he may seem to be fired from the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties intend to bend such a step however .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were elected to bill , according to which the special issu@@ ers could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Arctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg broke out from the scar@@ ring scar@@ cely seven times in Berlin .
this was shared by the Bremerhaven @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large colon@@ el is driven out now to the north and will probably be two , three years until it is melted .
it is one of 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ic@@ e@@ ders that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people will not go out of him .
however , when climate change has played a role in the crash of iron , research information is un@@ clear .
in total , there has been a series of unusual cl@@ ashes of ice @-@ ov@@ ens in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a Fak@@ ent background .
according to many scientists , this can be combined with global warming .
the broken col@@ on had previously been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C flock .
cra@@ w@@ ls are floating on the sea and is fed by large glac@@ iers .
therefore it grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ bow is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this flock was the balance of wa@@ x@@ ing and ab@@ rupt a few years ago .
a complete cra@@ w@@ ler @-@ like may fall there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it is quite a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C flock &apos;s risk is in danger , because the front edge never withdrawn as far as currently .
furthermore , the iron plate arise in tension and can be broken down , if there be a piece of a key .
the melting of ch@@ el@@ ine and ice @-@ berg increases the sea level not because they swim in the water and pushed the ice as much water as it yields the melting itself .
however , the loss of a seal is that the glacier can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small extent , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
after AW@@ I data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ melt is the fourth largest scar@@ city of Antar@@ cti@@ ca according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural event and does not have direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most widely retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C flock are back @-@ up or come back in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ ly said , and added : &quot; our models tell us that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if this researcher did not withdraw this gigantic ice vineyard on climate change , so in the past decades , many ice flo@@ ats of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are broken down .
this long section of the Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches for South America .
according to data from the British program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to decline .
in the past 50 years , Antar@@ ctic Peninsula was heated by around three degrees and thus count to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest rising .
CD@@ U wants to cope with the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy more difficult places , the CD@@ U calls out of the employer &apos;s employer to become more attractive .
shortly before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ day has achieved 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the Kreis@@ Administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have lost their first working day .
the apprenti@@ ce at the circle are obviously very sought .
in this year , around 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are currently 50 occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
amongst other things , physicians and engineers are being sought as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U is now to take the initiative in the C@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG .
administration should develop a concept for personnel recovery and personal development after the desire of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements of professionals , but future oriented towards the application short@@ ages , is it .
the overall concept should be orient@@ ated within and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ operations and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is looking forward to a good approach .
because the circle it has to do with personnel problems , which you did not know before .
other towns have good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive terms .
speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age caused by service .
thus , the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter W@@ ise , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had a thick surprise in the C@@ ret@@ a for a thick surprise when he publicly exhibited the human resources , and the rest of the parties bl@@ oss@@ om .
people want to be verified all the ways to be checked out from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come short to a satisfactory solution here , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gy@@ ms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; needs to strive together with the trade unions - a household tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U , the employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than it actually looks for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , increases or more money , if you are in higher level when they come to a higher level .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the new pro@@ stit@@ utes protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound to NGO @-@ migrants rescue boat
in Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not hold new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new Code of Code , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ n@@ itis warning arrived a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat to the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ aster &apos; , because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a manner that ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration .
the relief organization that has been in operation only since one year , refused to express themselves to an exec@@ ut@@ ary pen@@ alties of the Italian Nation@@ ality Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of the human life remains our top priority . so we &apos;re very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge any exc@@ uses that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities watched the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that the crew of infl@@ atable boat migrants will be delivered that they can be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive them back , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the pro@@ xy , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of susp@@ end on the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , rescue imports in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not inter@@ linking to any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly board an Italian police officers who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and life principles have so far been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they were no &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is .
Min@@ n@@ iti said now that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharp@@ ly , in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal waters and the collaboration with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were plans for people with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin State post , &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate region to enjoy four days of Trieste and tourist attractions .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wat@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ te@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , one of which could have seen far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the bearing levels .
between them there was always longer asc@@ ents , for a long tri@@ ght to be rewarded .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and to the folk festival guard market .
again the view point to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flo@@ g@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many meters were told .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and inc@@ iner@@ aries brought low breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the open air in@@ hale infl@@ ating healing .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga for E @-@ Sport
are the sports stars in future sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating in wind and weather over the stadium of the stadium ?
fact is : E @-@ Sport has long been a serious industry for a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high vibrations .
these have also recognised the first federal states that increasingly engage in this field .
in the beginning of 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded a E @-@ sport unit in mid @-@ July and gave two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the management board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven quali@@ fies .
Robin D@@ utt &apos;s great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football team has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old people that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sport athletes under the contract , it could be far more often present on these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ity to Asia .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or the soccer simulation of FIFA at competitive edge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the Asian games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is safe to need .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bed has also been dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions you can also find in classical sports , for example , increased heart frequencies , stress @-@ actions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it contains cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a spe@@ edy response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise in the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Hotel is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ bers also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
controls are hard @-@ run at online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport failed .
in positive results , the scientist lifts the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are on the way around the world , which is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consultancy firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Ministry of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) reported rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly over advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are to be 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ic@@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international are already continuing many countries .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ b@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team NR@@ G @-@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
a lot in Europe also does a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ bers .
according to D@@ utt &apos;s soccer clubs in the Netherlands and France , they are now oblig@@ ated to set up a E @-@ Sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B management board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in no@@ stal@@ gia , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is no longer enough today .
it is about to keep the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to prepare a modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can not hold fast that only with football , everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , forced Conrad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend with lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind grid and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was condemned in June for negli@@ gent hom@@ icide of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is indig@@ nant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a psych@@ ic illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions were killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor to the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she was not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no repentance shown . &quot;
but the lawyer &apos;s attor@@ ney said that it was a horri@@ ble res@@ s@@ ment that she is totally regre@@ t@@ table . &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their intellectual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no day in which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will be wearing for eternity with us for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pro@@ secuted by finding knowledge &quot; that she will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or being a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this one person , with whom I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain that I will keep to keep for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a justi@@ fiable preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , bringing it to a crime to commit any other to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ oxide in 2014 in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention to himself , after the words revealed it to him that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suspension you , spring from a building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know there are many ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent her death in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to activate the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit through some of the press .
the case has shared the law opinion .
among the few that Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder on their British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .
Mr@@ s Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and assistance , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i made the captain of the Audi Cup as captain , is not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern ple@@ ases the Con@@ gol@@ an Cup winner for a big season - extra motivation does not regret .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New came to see it , he made his hur@@ ried to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ tra@@ cker Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good that I could have a better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character from the coach was able to suggest so .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ant and just taken out of the holiday ann@@ ot@@ ting professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he .
su@@ gar@@ l they are distributed to those who want to hold much to those who want to keep in the mood .
so who has been chosen to compete the inheritance of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation is just fine .
K@@ imm@@ I confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was used as a mini @-@ Lah@@ ti over the field .
to the right behind , this is his position , the white bin@@ ds at the arm put their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting report as the one who can take the und@@ o@@ thing as best into the hands .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the eye for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al therefore , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ate almost ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , come out on the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in her first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Trieste do not fall negative .
this is all pretty good .
Sü@@ le ran along next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defence , both were sovereign .
the nam@@ ly occupied Napol@@ i storm is very difficult . moreover , Sü@@ le tried to successfully tried a couple of times even in the game construction .
indeed , his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the outcome was &quot; not so as we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed an extraordinary performance at the debut .
the raff@@ le , tem@@ pe@@ tion : &quot; for this style I was also fetched . &quot;
how un@@ used this Bayern world is still for the new processes , one saw in the game after the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs no one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ I passed after a few funny statements on the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase , &quot; What is going to go here now , I already noticed .
in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the New .
al@@ aba motivated furn@@ aces for women
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our E@@ FB @-@ Women

the Bavaria @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary is practically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ Capit@@ än@@ in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ver@@ ed with our Lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian soccer player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .
our ladies may well need the famous Bavaria @-@ Du@@ sel .
companies satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Foreign Minister : Wirtschaft , Wis@@ d Tempo
it is often designed to be ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , Minister of Economics from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate was .
this is demonstrated by more than one year in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the greatest turn@@ around looks at Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the connection of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands up at the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 is to be the right of construction .
a role in the plans of the country will also play the western tre@@ aties of Trier , which is on the basis of the federal government &apos;s basis demand .
the aim is to take the circuit in December 2020 , says the Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the industry and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) is stim@@ ulated in the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales growth in supermarkets and the trend for ten years to stop the German wine exports .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , Pra@@ ise the Chamber of Commerce .
the master chamber of Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent master@@ examination and 2,500 euro is provided by graduates within ten years after the master training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
the road construction of the planned road construction will be fast facts , at the same time , the country &apos;s necessary staff , Jan Glock@@ auer , says the main business leader of the Chamber of Trier .
to date , only 29 positions have been occupied by the 56 new engineers to build mobility .
the Chamber is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ct@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Aud@@ itors , in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of local roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the automotive angel in the region .
moreover , the old broad@@ band expansion in the country is also available .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in a chamber survey conducted only with the Note 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still standing in the supervisory board of the wind company Pro Wind .
in April , the Green @-@ group left Lem@@ ke to become a President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already returned the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ors face up with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said , BMW would be able to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is smar@@ ter options for travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus it is based on European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on - diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that emit diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and as@@ thma .
the cost of the automobile manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles are also ready to install , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreciation equipment to regulate the emissions if a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is not protected from extradition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German criminal investig@@ ations@@ in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of having installed a system in order to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and a demand that focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could use Volkswagen hard : the luxury car manufacturer carries over @-@ proportional to the gain of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order to take away the Is@@ ar visitor , tomorrow morning a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message .
on Saturday again the Is@@ ar moves on to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ tern and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building doesn &apos;t want to clari@@ fy .
there is a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ent in the raft .
there is a gar@@ bage dump .
the pre@@ lu@@ de to a public awareness campaign to app@@ end to the Is@@ ar @-@ visitor .
with the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen@@ ed as a protected game flow .
already last summer , the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are other actions and measures to achieve a crazy and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines and the laughter against the suffering
mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published carto@@ ons dra@@ fts@@ men , the bu@@ sti@@ bles of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 % of Argentina he is still working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as a drawing for happiness postcards by what he asked him fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job , &quot; he once said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
ever again the artist had inspired him to inspire cities .
large , dish mor@@ dil@@ lo @-@ figures were st@@ rolling in drawings with the push tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on drawing , working day almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches can continue its dro@@ oping figures as much distribution worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es in his drawings - which has a thousands of starters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
for this reason , he reli@@ es on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is being produced .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence , threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the repro@@ duci@@ ble conditions and because of diseases @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers attemp@@ ting to find solutions to find great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM was in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively vulnerable , because the plant had been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has much less rain in the spring , and in autumn much more .
this has impact on the lifespan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there is a lot of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil isn &apos;t only enough for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and weakened either missing or weakened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ or@@ ation from the ground , but also the testing of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa are celebrating its 1200 th anniversary this year .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce will normally meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days in order to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ cess@@ ory drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of a attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 or let them go home .
safety experts have written three words on a plaque in front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ ale , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ en feeling .
there are drug g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , journalists who are suspected of making the state of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no breaks of violence , and throughout the country there are more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has resigned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stood after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now , there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their editors and inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear T @-@ Shirts , who show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to handle the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the protection of journalists .
as in most thousands of mur@@ ders , who are linked every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put in court .
with Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are uns@@ afe and although the territory is still av@@ eng@@ ed .
without information about the killer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security is little useful , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we trust everyone . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the Office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the shooter tos@@ sed in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to be able to ro@@ b in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is nothing but silence on the topic of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it does not take that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of delayed , two @-@ story m@@ ol@@ aters for drug royal , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal states with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) was a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings has contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interview with the Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ist cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this publication may have off@@ ended the children , assumed power members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in it , Val@@ dez did not force to force after the arrest of another newspaper , which had made the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without pushing on the cra@@ d@@ ote of poison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper picked up a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honourable reporting , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it to publish tough final studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat them .
she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for eight years after the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , &quot; she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in that same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in tracking the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the presence of many dead ... Why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse the boy@@ friend , the friend , gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar from the office , going to sit still at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine labor ?
his death has also forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions to question , how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their little shops , their home @-@ and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ retreat and self @-@ maintaining .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells , stay away , stay away .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening to Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no longer than in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other States , where a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ abs , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce came to safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it was known that Spyware , who is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside were two polic@@ emen outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ piece building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an in a central part of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half of the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who described the governor himself as not trusted .
it is months ago since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape , where drug are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has kn@@ itted on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the national spending , which focused on the home town of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite site of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a reporter had learned from public recordings that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which prevailed almost all the century all political levels .
most recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with corruption due to high @-@ cali@@ bre cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ r asked the reporter for writing in this eating house , among them one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers had the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez for the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something of what they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez on a few signs and walked in the next morning at a demonstration due to another journalist at the Prosecutor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame van@@ ished three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ dly in the whole country by writing journalists in organized Prot@@ ects &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and bring them to the truth , because they have said the truth .
she has so asked that she is sub@@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has violated its objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico took place of organiz@@ ational crimes against the government officials and a similar society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who put together the organized crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the Mor@@ de has a terrible effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay next to their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close like the paper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach , in March .
others continue to do , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their native states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they pursue after the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , believes that drug traffi@@ cking are dis@@ ma@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I was reporter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting at the side@@ walk ahead of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones started to sum@@ p@@ ate .
a series of shooting paintings with band@@ ed belts and security holes in the vicinity of the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the stap@@ le edge , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ els close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , having held the watch to see if they were read@@ iness in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose finger @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can also only think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was murdered the same day to the Javier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practition@@ ers asked me to send them on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a sc@@ ary .
now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ ns of a Canadian mountain work were so good that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could find out that his g@@ aun@@ ching skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the man@@ ned Din@@ osau@@ rs , the ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition , researchers that believe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; bl@@ oss@@ om
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met on something which seemed out of the surrounding rocks , and decided to take a closer look .
discovered by him F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal ty@@ po@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology in the Royal ty@@ rant Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of severe ear@@ ump .
after all of this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blin@@ ded only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that they slept &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal ty@@ po@@ rell Museum , where the creature has to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science than one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with a ru@@ pul@@ sion , resembles a changing tank that was probably threatened by meat @-@ consuming dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily damaged dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technology that is known as anti@@ lic@@ ally , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to avoid itself better in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten their enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now shown in the Royal ty@@ po@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and mun@@ itions on his body .
they discovered the sha@@ dy , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the confron@@ tation is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals live today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs are hun@@ ted enough pressure by flesh @-@ e@@ ther dinosau@@ rs that the evolution of the confron@@ tation was bene@@ fici@@ ent as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals , who have the confron@@ tation - think of deer or sh@@ ear @-@ animals - are much less and inf@@ ring@@ ing as a prey , what is indicated that this no@@ dos@@ ing was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong pir@@ ate behaviour on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs had to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his fourth performer , to find out what it did as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where it sank on the back of the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta has been as warm as Southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ ing rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ ving your skin but also maintained in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you throw only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal baths , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth was gone through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus belongs to this , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists who appear the latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk in the sea after death in the sea and in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he died on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the preserved dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was in@@ hib@@ ited by the Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded in the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ rs keep his armour in exquisite item detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well received , that the skin step is still going to cover heavy tank panels along the dinosau@@ rs
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a gain in the lottery .
the more I see it , the conf@@ using it is .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low@@ ly tank panels that carry the skul@@ ls of the beast .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are r@@ amped up .
I can count the sheds on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
severe accident on the A8 night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous Ver@@ sions , kilomet@@ er@@ onal St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) .
after the first dis@@ closures of the police at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the junction Order of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a wit@@ ters about 30 cars , among them probably also trucks .
concerning the exact number of the publishers , no data were published before .
it is about light to moderate injuries , said a polic@@ eman .
an enormous adv@@ ent of life vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 motorway was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ stone was formed .
as a AZ reporter reports , it was also on the opposite way to massive disabled - by numerous G@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire bri@@ gade took the mark of the vehicle &apos;s gl@@ en@@ ker , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
in doing so it was a coll@@ ision between a car ship and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group scores &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is seated in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and awak@@ ens an unclean , or breaks the driver in the middle of work@@ flow .
driver control .
but the time of interrup@@ tions are over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the non @-@ existent driving control .
you simply use the phone that you have taken his seat and thus util@@ ises the ticket .
at present , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get the offer , we extend it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available to many more remote routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train to the chassis de@@ valuation without a manager .
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which should already do most passengers anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the App &apos;s App via the DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable way of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one increases in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; .
then on the test customers a button on electronic de@@ valuation will appear .
the train att@@ endant got on their mobile devices a message that B@@ g@@ ast X has taken in the train and the booked seat area Y has taken .
if the train att@@ endant with the driver control to No. Y , he knows that a passenger with a already valuable online ticket is seated .
so you can continue to sleep , keep going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the clients , one for the train - which is to use the passengers again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our train crew , would just like to check in the DB &apos;s navig@@ ator .
this allows passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board by DB Fern@@ and .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are often walking , you know that , in addition to delays and adapted the ticket controls are among the most important off@@ ences .
for often , in any case , one of the users don &apos;t have any documents yet , which you need to use online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or a document must be found either .
the consequence are endless discussions between train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the part or greater area and delays in the control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is also on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell ten@@ dered to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just been killed an 18 year old child and still exists on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand @ the@@ e@@ Pharmac@@ o@@ ah was constantly ad@@ ored on its tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen at Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; remembered Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she laid her mobile phone , later to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police had just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , he secured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , saying , &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot; animals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled its statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and who we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment , I felt sho@@ oters .
I was mad and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home on the next day .
after landing at 11 a.m. she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , the love and power of power that consists of the strength and resistance of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell passed with her daughter , who had a cau@@ li@@ flower and a suitable crown , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they think ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it is necessary to know and see it and raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I was lucky to give her a experience in which she personally experienced not a ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women child .
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived at Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police agency , which became a camp@@ ground , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have connected with local business partners , which made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m started to embrace the form of fer@@ rell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after August 9 , totally changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ ur@@ se Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
following , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you document , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ti@@ cism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as follows in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , have not cent@@ ered their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
the post had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m over death @-@ in@@ sect in@@ mates .
his commitment was closer to Fer@@ rell the project together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so will I be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ing &apos;s experience - in order to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls lives , how she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain cred@@ itors in this work and in human purposes of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who have led the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media following the kill@@ ings of the black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , s@@ ule women have to carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement truly is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is no longer creative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell ten@@ ds to be selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although she was at the front front , because with a life in these Kreuz@@ ts as a black , gay , woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have gone long since , but ra@@ cial links between the church and the police continue to exist .
he@@ rell ten@@ dered on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that they call her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ashes on a song and she feels committed to this memory , since then she went into Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern outskirts of the pedestrian zone has been sp@@ inning as the population of advoc@@ ate and opponents in 2009 .
cold the subject hardly makes it cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one used to tell a bit of a bit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or very plain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents make sure that a gallery goes to more customers into the city , the rest of which also benefit from the rest of the city , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot , on which the farm market stands , in which 13 direct marketing will offer their products .
this will end with the start of the construction .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall to the new building - and to the Bed@@ a square with opportunity to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the women are always happy to come back .
we have discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sett@@ les at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should be quite low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; what is shopping branches in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ills or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty here - some have been standing for months and years .
but since there is not even a ordinary weekly market , it is all more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle will remain at least .
because all the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is indeed inexpensive .
as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping center only of larger firms , because the rentals are often not portable for a single re@@ ta@@ iler .
too bad , special shops there is almost no longer and what is still left , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle fits not for me .
and the gallery does not fit for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market place during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery gets actually at some point .
or does it create the ghost @-@ gallery previously , to drive out all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s just not going to work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but there is no space for a farmhouse ... thanks to the mad many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmhouse is done , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost unlimited - which depend on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ es and Hair Pieces , which were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analysts decided to serve a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison after having opened diplomatic news about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , means A Bec@@ oming Res@@ identi@@ al ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous dis@@ co whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like man with these genom@@ ic data , a sharp , if also something intellectual comments could not only be created for the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ations of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but has already been informed about the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six charges against the sp@@ y law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is sitting un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a platinum bl@@ onde per@@ gap - which she has been associated with her .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
therein , the artist portra@@ ys the portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts , such as cigarette stub@@ born and chew@@ ing gum , extracted in the DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of what these people could look like .
this was the point where she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg stated at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit that time , and she couldn &apos;t shoot at this time , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were invited to un@@ cover letters that replaced several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a shoot of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; supple@@ mental images , &quot; which would be able to convert a future in which the president of Chel@@ ci@@ de would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter ways to fix the rigid cre@@ ams , which he had to fix it further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a wall written on the wall of the gallery written Mann@@ ing with its superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation would have been sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and an Ace , written in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nuclear oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as astonishing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully will be able to take care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , trace back Mem@@ ories , can also be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is one page from the top of the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing as it dives with a free @-@ free fall in the hand of the disciplines of the United States of the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they want to be cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so it is never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get hat@@ eful when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was supposed to do in the com@@ ic book - but if it was supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room of mas@@ ks , of their own genom@@ ic simulation , which are gathered together as hormone products .
this was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , which were written by using a pencil with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of human being , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western University and an employee at the Oxford University of Oxford
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is currently in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been examined as susp@@ ects after a man had been explored in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ sia ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the records of the district court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several engra@@ vings died .
a common warning system by the police station in Chicago states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the site of events for dead , and detec@@ tives examine the engra@@ vings as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ wn has been a professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ wn it now in assessment and was excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University has co@@ operated on this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cub@@ bage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a senior officer at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were in contact with the police in Britain and ready to assist the United States investig@@ ative authorities in any conc@@ ei@@ vable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and wanted to be sho@@ cked .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Regulations of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he meets the susp@@ ect the susp@@ ect of the authorities .
&quot; the police have a presentation of their position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to susp@@ end the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a convi@@ vial tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ wn and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ched a variety of motives including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of the criteria for the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ A@@ DA @-@ timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ A@@ DA schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the site of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that might cause Russia to concern .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and W@@ A@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have approved the reported results of the W@@ A@@ DA research approval by the Canadian At@@ tor@@ ney of Richard McLaren in the state @-@ funded D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has received a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not give something which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v has problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but then said : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report re@@ str@@ ates positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als of D@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main quarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ A@@ DA @-@ General Director : Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

it has called people from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen , to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the preparation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to discuss special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ g@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite exec@@ utives to turn back directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used by companies to measure employee engagement .
salvation has said that they think a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and pol@@ ls of certain teams , there is a heat map of the company that show a view which units have most complaints and which exec@@ utives low absorption results - so that you can drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you don &apos;t have been involved in the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee describes a blog post published in which those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .

like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company will send tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; pol@@ ls , collect confi@@ dential answers in real @-@ time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report to the staff .
and when the main shareholder is involved , complaints direct to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by Consumer Bo@@ y@@ k@@ ott , employee @-@ fu@@ gation and cler@@ ks , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and process and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
in the meantime , as the company Conver@@ cent creates problems , problems , who were at the presence of managers , were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair inter@@ ns , identified and addressed .
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said vit@@ rano that leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and legal disputes . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and co @-@ workers commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke down due to eth@@ ical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that their dirty clothes went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and debit the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both supported start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the entire capital to $ 47 million .
having secured a total of $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and completed its total funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff is more than expected from their work@@ stations than before .
Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only , in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are glad to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you do is profitable , then they feel stronger to do this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Au@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In that both both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are well run . companies are running fine when employees are involved and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools do third promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employees &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , there is a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management of Kot@@ ter International , the company who have seen themselves too much on gathering data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you worry about it ?
and if you do not take care of it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who passes through monthly surveys , was able to lead measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so deliver@@ er .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights into the staff , and it hopes for a long view , that leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose human beings , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses .
the N@@ C@@ AA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers will talk on one side of the new practice fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved their trimm@@ ing parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returning after the three hours exercise to their final tests before they return to the water Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ t @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ C@@ AA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has indeed extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already full pack@@ ers of players .
the compromise of the two days is more than a day when the brood moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ times in West@@ wood exercises practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the formal playing preparations for their kick off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ takes the control of the N@@ C@@ AA , even if the player provides comprehensive routes to the player another point .
&quot; we put this enormous burden for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they pier@@ ced them , they move on , and they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it is really magnificent . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices , as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear visibility of its fields from a neighbouring car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been kicked out with foot balls , which is a protection network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task .
brood @-@ ins are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spati@@ te one could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ brought to think that people can rent there a room and then set up there to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and an exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
therefore I don &apos;t have a great wor@@ ries about me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ feit messages from third parties and their results below the original entry , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight the F@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible counter@@ feit messages , and they may send them at the Fak@@ itors , the possibly results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 United States presidential elections .
the problem is also become a major political topic in Europe , with the French voters flooded out in May with wrong stories , and Germany is supposed to have a plan to be punished according to social media networks , if they did not succeed one @-@ filled post@@ ings like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a review of the new facts examination .
&quot; apart from finding the third parties &quot; stories , people want more context to meet well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share &quot; , &quot; said Sara Su , Product of Facebook for Facebook News in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that Facebook continues to be able to test his feature in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with other changes to its messages , to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; I just re@@ acts on the thum@@ b of a letter that was re@@ acted by a double star in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and they went up to smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if he himself would be .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with old papers that he has been supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I have lost my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; New Castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the mon@@ ted hy@@ phen@@ ols in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , gar@@ dening , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust got its full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates said &quot; Oh , they described it on the attic . &quot;
letters , letters from the period of the English Emp@@ ires , maps , which they had : &quot; you might think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought for two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to make a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man , who is leaving the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a ri@@ ot that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmer arose in this area and I thought a insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The prim@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , which hidden the family of Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , represented by the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell out of the 18th century , filled his own fun@@ eral , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;@@ favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be considerable f@@ aun@@ ting , making money again and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell ten@@ ds to extingu@@ ish their debt crisis by taking rich women &apos;s women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ b experiences
he has brought a double @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ blasph@@ emed ki in the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ required by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to be ready with the dam@@ n life &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Camp@@ a@@ ign : over 300 years old Mari@@ &apos;s Chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the wra@@ pping of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ &apos;s Chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday their campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z logo and its slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to be the cul@@ mination of the campaign a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the M@@ acher of the promotion has been asking for posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think of this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them online at their yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm belief that we know as bath Hon@@ our citizens around the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to form@@ ulate a lon@@ ging pledge , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she is standing in the competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef can be due to its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear before the army
every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) graduated in Off@@ er@@ ings .
like this a week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part .
they were civilians in the Y@@ as in the over@@ count .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
general Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air force and the Navy have been removed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , Secretary of State Tor@@ og@@ an 169 has fired 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire rope of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who had been involved in the coup attempt immediately , this week is being negotiated in Ankara .
on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an called on the overthrow of God &apos;s gift &quot; as he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an did really get a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general rule , concerns concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , who manifested themselves among other things in the repe@@ al of the head@@ lines for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , &quot; wrote the newspaper .
the bulk handling in the army and the security holes goes on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent a further 73@@ 95 state operator , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed like an ear@@ ths about the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the masters of the country .
three times they sli@@ pped under appeal to their role as the custo@@ dian of the world leaders .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed forward the power of the military step for step , not least to appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an was driven by a targeted Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer who was seeking asylum from persecution against persecu@@ tions abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years .
if this applies to it , NATO could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , there are doubts about the alliance in the alliance with the service of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he is able to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , strictly forbidden regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the president .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way of citizens from other countries to Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains on migration and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the funds given to the financial means to support himself and knowledge that are coming to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate the route for racing transportation
over the past few months , over the future of the racing transportation sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , on the quiet road , the tourist railway station is to be built .
in order to secure the future of racing transportation sh@@ utt@@ les , according to the transport of the German Ministry of Culture , this year , construction work will start on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order the route Ilmenau @-@ Race platform , the country is especially responsible for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Transport State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route transported to approximately 2.5 million euros .
this sum obtained 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , is currently un@@ matched , S@@ üh@@ l explained .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen railway than operators were agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles used , and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race platform @-@ Shuttle should be ordered in regular jobs on December 2017 .
the racing shuttle bus is one of the popular train connections between the Ilmenau railway stations and the railway platform .
during the last months the course of a pilot enterprise has been tested , if the route of sufficient many people is used to order them again regular in the future .
in addition , the distance is di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried .
just as they thought that in 2017 , there can be no more failure in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex @-@ robots are currently a major thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do make them funny , but the companies deliver any amount of it , and we will get them more often more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern head@@ lines have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon tissue , which feels warm , with aware of the human reaction that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its convi@@ ctions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select anything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot through the shape of ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there will be more sc@@ arier , as many robots own &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would like to make a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ des have evolved into robots with a silicone .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties that they are attra@@ ctively finding , such as rel@@ ap@@ se .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ses and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the web site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day their m@@ oods - quite like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many sc@@ and@@ ing aspects in this promotion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ contra@@ cted female features , the play@@ lists on rape , if one is going to take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : ref@@ unding ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Me@@ an Ro@@ xx@@ xy negotiated with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex lighter .
their birth and its increasing refin@@ ement refer to something dark and deep in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a wish for sex with sub@@ jection as an optional addition .
most men are of course not holding sex robots , and while the FR@@ R continues its rising popularity , they still remain pre@@ limin@@ arly on the edge of consumer culture .
but what is sick@@ le out of the mar@@ g@@ inal zones , in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until they give the free market to them .
there is a certain persu@@ asion that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a time where the rights of women are threatened across the globe , in which the White House has a pre@@ sidents who has ended sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that are swallowed up bodies and the cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gene@@ tics want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can not separate or go away from their companion .
they do not have a medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing which suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination .
expressed in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the expressions of speech by 2017 :
tr@@ umps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of wholes@@ ome human mind
it has become a binding era of the tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions , which have polari@@ zed the U.S. voters , have also split families in small size .
around Christmas and thanksgiving , there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the hor@@ rors of Tr@@ ump &apos;s relatives .
we all allegedly tried to burst into our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ ices have been noticed by power Tr@@ umps , family .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ alig@@ ned po@@ etic , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lics in our family for a long time this week has visited me in New York .
it reminded me that the unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everybody knows whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship that had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side .
to the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks to itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency has the power to push all the right to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tear , we refer to the gra@@ ce@@ able possibility that our kittens of one day could no longer stum@@ ble .
there is , however , there is a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , in which the b@@ ump of Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alizes that suddenly in comparison to its standards , suddenly appear as a statement of deteri@@ oration .
I find myself nowadays of an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ antic version of dec@@ ay - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in fact occur as a very mild criminal .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ uss@@ ers of New York &apos;s Park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in town , if no caffeine needed .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning to watch full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the col@@ li@@ ent music gives it a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just a righteous man .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage in fact - the themes @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since two two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given him a full score , but fortunately nobody asked them .
on the other hand I was comp@@ elled to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale ranging from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in a coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to purchase the rating with a 15 % tip to purchase anything about the cargo table .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what was actually a neutral exchange , but also exec@@ uting pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I tired the experience , you submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time in a hospital visit .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of schn@@ apps , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder following an appeal by the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , taking it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria for her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention to put an appeal against the six @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence from Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too l@@ ent .
the national law en@@ forcement authorities said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa against the objection , and the objection may be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quad@@ rup@@ tions from F@@ iers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released to the school holidays and the leading schools .
three of the de@@ fer@@ ment students will in future go to gymn@@ asi@@ um , four at the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed parents and representatives of public at the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the school@@ children , the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der gets a young eagle that grows in poultry , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The e@@ agles of the chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it hat@@ ch of his chickens .
instead of chicken broth , a small eagle was released .
however , the hope to make a chicken sm@@ ashed out of him , spreading the eagle on a high mountain of its wings and escaped .
afterwards the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Eagle stand for the integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the other kittens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination be to be free .
they wished to every four @-@ quad@@ rup@@ y that he feels himself in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former school@@ master , Michael Mu@@ eller , who will always jump in training courses , and the parents .
the cooking time is over now , explained class @-@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she does not leave their students after two years of lessons only , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ quad@@ rup@@ tions .
the closing of all students will sound a song of summer time and holiday season .
and with the children , great joy broke out .
for the new school year , eight first kl@@ ets are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal detention camps in Greece , distributed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently a investigation is running .
the State Department told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians was released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened the control over the free Camp@@ s and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the subjects need to know now
how exactly does the software update place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behavior of cars of the Euro 5 emission standard and Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 Diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE car Club Europe gives up ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action legally oblig@@ atory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann Software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the upgra@@ ding has been ordered by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers inform about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy completion in the next few months , but is not called an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write any person concerned .
if any inspection are due , this will be done within the framework .
how long will the restructuring costs remain overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains from the commitment to the manufacturer and from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ aker will not act on the issue of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should this update ?
the upgrade could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming may be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , which do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE av@@ eng@@ ed to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would go back , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive prize fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where passengers are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas , there are no value @-@ loss for older diesel .
the ACE is advis@@ able to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in the Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promised to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the prestigious awards listed by the renowned Kennedy Center .
in this year , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ ographer , Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) , and the TV @-@ producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
they are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the winner of the L@@ ear @-@ based TV series now announced that L@@ ear has already announced to ren@@ ounce its participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to be negle@@ cted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arts and Human Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and the funds charged me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city life worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ ch@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the upcoming year .
the passage is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ ch@@ meister is .
and the work still makes it great fun , as he con@@ veys in the Press Conference .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is wonder@@ ing that no application has to fulfil the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
so - under the contemp@@ t of the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for an elab@@ oration .
since H@@ lach has been set for the administration of the authority as a sub @-@ wing authority , the applicant must assign appropri@@ ately .
for this function does not want to keep the city on any event .
if they were unable to fill them out , the citizens would have to drive for consultations until Offen@@ burg .
but people near the city and himself are important , &quot; says W@@ acker who reports from a good working climate and good senti@@ ment between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have been collected , based on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future offers varied projects at the agenda : the conversion of former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ist parking space are joined .
the cinema bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium premises is still subject .
the latter only will hit the latter with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; is h@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the gre@@ enery is mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye that fits , &quot; if new@@ buildings are approved , &quot; the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ ch@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility anyway .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end all things will be on my table . &quot;
in case of care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( High building ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain with the place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operation , but also for the more design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Roland W@@ acker wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker , a degree of degree of graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture should have a degree of expertise in the areas of building and building planning .
the municipal office building underground and deep construction , building planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ age affairs , management of urban properties , municipal enterprise with building yard and municipal gar@@ dener , as well as sub @-@ mining authority , including monument protection .
thrown bikes on lines : south@@ side track blocked .
according to the police , the unknown perpet@@ rators had previously thrown the blue bike from the railway track shifted in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged , that the se@@ ah@@ able freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male workers and seek after them for the night of the night .
close to the Tat@@ ort of witnesses , a ro@@ sy chamber and bike driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch said to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , would have put themselves in great danger and also at risk of train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the installation , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the costs for rail transport , also pi@@ cking clients could be provided to the perpet@@ rators .
overall , according to a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ person said .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities .
there were just ten people on Friday afternoon , two of them related to the correspondence .
goods did not fall , but they did not delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged some 200 meters high speed lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red me@@ ats , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel movements )
red me@@ ats and chocolate may sound for your digest@@ ion system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study is exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases might relie@@ ve the symptoms .
the un@@ think@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causes mag@@ nets and blo@@ wers , recur@@ ring or bloody ra@@ ins , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the subjects are normally deb@@ ated to relie@@ ve flesh and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ine patented , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide themselves in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are capable of sol@@ vent inflamm@@ ation are compensated by cells , protecting the tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance of convey@@ ance immun@@ o@@ deficiency occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the buildings of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an in@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han diet can toler@@ ate food toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory intest@@ ine , if the same system is also affected by humans .
Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan visited a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study m@@ ages such cells had such cells , but there was another group of the same tribe that had not been separated .
they thought that the difference to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the po@@ orer of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were removed in a ster@@ il@@ itary environment , so that a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers left L. re@@ uter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to imm@@ atur@@ ation cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells evol@@ ves to toler@@ ate cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people are able to toler@@ ate the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us have L. re@@ uter@@ i on our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han products from L. re@@ uter@@ i the cells in humans develop like in mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , because these cells control inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the bo@@ wel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ de@@ values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to a expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening he had his debut on S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impres@@ ses in the holders as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Beli@@ ever mar@@ ched .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and gave only 45 minutes to win M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started his start @-@ XI from the start of the season as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
in this week , The Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho loved three more new eng@@ agements , but he insi@@ sted that the club had made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four prime ministers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screen the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new show for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
like the wind , however , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was head of the SPD politician , the prime minister @-@ democr@@ at @-@ prime minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no wind from the Bund - was the most important desire of the electoral campaign .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , the fundamental has changed .
since then , the employees look at the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus and increasing the events in the SPD @-@ moved state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described in the approach .
there were lows .
and one after another .
the Federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and gre@@ enery .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot be dep@@ rec@@ ated , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ ction@@ ction of a Green M@@ EPs set out the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the country code lost its red @-@ green coalition with its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the Green Party executive director Michael Kell@@ ner to admit their mandate to the Saxon Green Party El@@ ke T@@ enth to release their mandate .
the over@@ comes to the CD@@ U means a clear violation of the choice of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ Asc@@ ent must immediately restore their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign of the Green Editor &apos;s Green Editor network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a SPD won a campaign , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ary message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ comes of the green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ ons to the CD@@ U without its own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ related associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the failure began with unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ ming down the com@@ rades .
according to the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and that &apos;s what it became clear - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the de@@ mar@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ura sp@@ aw@@ ed the party smooth .
the com@@ rades re@@ acted back in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next deep sleep with him .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD h@@ aul , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ t@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he was doing wrong in the crisis communication so pretty much everything one can make wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z strug@@ gles against his political survival .
now even Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ emission standards and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ prime minister has already been in criticism since the past .
mi@@ ese transfer@@ ed values came .
nevertheless , maybe , or perhaps , therefore , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ entu@@ ate acc@@ ents in the league .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was also hidden by com@@ rades in the Martin Schulz environment .
they let him give him , because they promised to be a St@@ abi@@ lization of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
on this occasion , Weil meets the Lower Saxony Green Party in the valley are no gu@@ ilt .
and Mr Schulz do not .
in times , the com@@ rades will make an effort to keep their own ranks .
their wrath is set up on the Green Party , and here especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in the v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy nar@@ rative , such as Mrs. T@@ enny puts her own career dinner on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party Left Party in the SPD Parliament Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ Asc@@ ent is not elected as a direct channel dat@@ in , but by the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens into parliament , so the sa@@ x@@ onian members continue to continue .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate within four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal kar@@ it@@ ators of a future CD@@ U representatives det@@ ects the electoral result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ordered to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more informations of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years , may soon be supported by the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development took place on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look back on the past events .
since 1991 it has been in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation .
at that time , between 1991 and 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the contribution was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , not only to include new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government of Government Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ organisation III .
the funding tot@@ als 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which cu@@ res 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community .
how will there be a sanit@@ ising area ?
one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ ate .
where appropriate , the area limits may also move again again .
the j@@ etty started on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the content of the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program in which the san@@ ction would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of internal cities , improving the residential and working conditions and maintaining and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objec@@ tion@@ ately , that is , in the plot .
the san@@ itation area would then be determined as a statute .
the funding period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the current inventory would be carried out once again , as part of which involved in the refurb@@ ishment involved in the refurb@@ ishment .
in November or December , the proposition should take place as possible , in order to begin with the s@@ lan@@ ders next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every community has had to carry out preliminary investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore necessary to evaluate the urban abuse and decide when san@@ iti@@ ed and in what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will also be entered for the respective land also a re@@ organisation in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann become even more busy once again and a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel pointed out an important success factor for the project to be the participation of the involved parties .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that can be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it goes among other things in order to build the construction and refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and Hou@@ sing arm , &quot; the details , spl@@ itting , and residents of a housing can be made .
the blue &quot; arc &quot; is to be filled only if they are operated in the building areas .
however , at the same time , Got@@ zel pointed out that a questionnaire which is not the same at the same time is an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding is according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ ists &quot; function - who first comes , gr@@ ind first .
you can &apos;t reserve the funds for later . &quot;
at the end of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; project were shown to make a renovation work . &quot;
British inventor itself supports a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that it will open its doors to enter his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index , and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and a dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the Company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American manufacturing within the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which have been left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Hel@@ icop@@ ter Hel@@ icop@@ ter was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House requested the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( HM@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the HM@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior naval aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7@@ pm on July 17th at the South La@@ wn at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would need for return flight .
during the event , the occupation of the flight was under the helicopter , while the personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the period .
the records presented by the TIM@@ E were not clear if a second flight crew was finally necessary .
the Hatch Act for@@ bi@@ ds the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that HM@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we set was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are sealed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as official event from the White House and had not been covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the President had a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ens@@ ing government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was driven in front of its first round of Kamp@@ ag@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ way , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the assistant director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
HM@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise re@@ prim@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany , HM@@ x @-@ 1 led the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted the flight needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps which were presented on the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to face the helicopter on South La@@ wn .
HM@@ x @-@ 1 has no budget terms for the presidential routes , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the funding of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D registration rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estim@@ ation rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand study from 2015 , the fees for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former Press@@ conference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which many Americans have un@@ ti@@ ring .
it is , of course , reasonable to empha@@ size that . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down into the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and v@@ asses with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three thereof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss about tri@@ cky task
the leader of the Second tennis player starts at Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will begin tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leader in the Second tennis Bundesliga has been making sense for reality .
at any rate , team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay decided to respect the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
straight on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V mainly the imports coming from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to entries in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , And@@ re Go@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ ben , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will be as always difficult for us .

how America can hurt the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump did not succeed , when on Wednesday evening , his signature was set under the law to en@@ act the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his haste to adopt the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and in Brussels ashamed of the US crash .
after all , the draft resolution , European companies will be able to help the Russians , to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors from the OM@@ V domestic product , co @-@ financed together with other European firms , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East In@@ sof@@ ar Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ y@@ ness is enormous .
nevertheless , it was too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact Donald Tr@@ ump should indeed have to raise the sanctions as an executive order to life .
twelve weapons are at choice for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could defend , and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

central back@@ wards : the city sets up 46 kitchen spaces
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lun@@ atics itself again .
with permanent partners for the children and an order to the team .
the watch is turned back in the urban kinder@@ garten .
on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply to the urban pedi@@ atri@@ cal facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own risk .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ ance , Assistant director in the field of youth welfare , is that a good news : &quot; we all really enjoyed it . &quot;
he continues to cook outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled .
the city operates 46 day@@ time centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a warm meal .
in the past kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not only children who are cared for by 45 lessons , at the K@@ ita K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this offer applies also in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay till 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces have from 1 September food service : they heat up the delivered food , supple@@ ment@@ ing the meals , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , leave the food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are allocated to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ sets as well as se@@ minal facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it concerns : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ strength to the team is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is entrusted to them , not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita spaces - so far the task of the chi@@ pper forces - is done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen @-@ performance , also the charm , which is in the cost equal to self @-@ reg@@ ression and foreign exchange for the city as the most economic , it is from the Press Agency .
and that , although 46 particles are set to be re @-@ employed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not as strong for approximately 750 people in the parent &apos;s area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can be only representative when all members of the society , including women , plays a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning leaders of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women shall be in the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ aries for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and cre@@ dible , when women participate in unlimited and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have released thre@@ ats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting in an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time passed the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan @-@ independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women of all registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
one trade union would like to make sure about the long term commitment of the Bis@@ c@@ ite @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long term commitment to produce in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland stated that the company had silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be first experienced when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s demanded , &quot; concerns that financing to moderni@@ ze production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity of the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross country , affecting our members .
generations of families have been working here and the labour force concentr@@ ating strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social benefits .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and from the background of the Bre@@ x@@ ite , the rising civil service costs and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a fl@@ oral productive presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ ale of T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , since we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions have been openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , check our businesses constantly - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are recogni@@ zing the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changed at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in its pursu@@ it of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve his overhead lines , but in Barcelona they have been warned about three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has created the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for most paid professionals in the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has en@@ forced its way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board is that the club always has its best in order to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for the club to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know when they touch one of our players , then we will be standing in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have crossed the line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly stated that they would not allow it to go to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ ora Spar@@ rows Report Hol@@ ds pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ple@@ Spar@@ rows report to the abuse rub@@ b@@ ish by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ bre@@ wing sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to be held for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ g , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained in the publication opposite the German Press Agency , as well as President Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the quoted Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their back assessment of the processes .
in contrast , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the coverage about violence in the Dom@@ atzen with &quot; two measures &quot; would be measured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as regards the attacks in Regensburg , no one would have to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and damaged deeds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would be punished and prevented in the future ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the degree of media mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis explained in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will gladly go on to the church and this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fres@@ co@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a whole ordinary educational media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , just as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the ab@@ bre@@ aches , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared in connection with the reports about the abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg to the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
in total , a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ inion had been used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high pl@@ otted vity &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ don@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , this means that from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence .
in the case of a high emotional level , the punishment for the pupils could be even more fer@@ oci@@ ous .
in contrast to numerous other claims , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. valued and thus in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explained why the final report to the ab@@ bre@@ wery andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against protective devices , is a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one lift up many students in his &quot; Hum@@ anity . &quot;
for the other , it also appears as a cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the econom@@ ist , when a domain name was not a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
there are only eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or dow@@ sing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violent interest at the pre@@ school was held outside of its active sector .
you can throw it at all , too late , or have not taken the first reference to be taken seriously .
the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gramm@@ ar school , on which he worked , was recognized by virtually all the respondents - &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellence , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discreet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as very goo@@ dly teachers who provided the boys regularly with cake , bis@@ cuits and bonds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of grapes from children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotions , which also led to che@@ ut@@ out breaks .
that he didn &apos;t just cra@@ ve on the ground with chairs and threw the keywords , but also put out ear @-@ like boys to the hair or ears , he has already admitted already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and have been dis@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
it must , however , must be said that such gu@@ ardi@@ ans methods in the fra@@ grant period , in the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents such as teachers .
do you know such bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born in 1968 .
I also experienced it in a se@@ cular school , a national high school .
compared to what it &apos;s actually about in this report , namely , the terrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre@@ school are the free excav@@ ators .
it is wonder@@ ing if it does not want to do with his acquaint@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media had just collapsed .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never did him understand might still be ze@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report ent@@ rails Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , it was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral Spar@@ rows .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also have any processing or knowledge with regard to sexual abuse of burden ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have been entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subject of interested in the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and sisters , then definitely not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do we evaluate the Dom@@ inion students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ing student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had enough findings in which he would have been unable to stop ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been unable to stop the appropriate perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for real absurd , to assume that it is calculated to be in@@ sist@@ ent or cle@@ arer , or rather re@@ opened , compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ managers , confi@@ denti@@ als , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in advance , people affected and / or their surrounding areas could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is then to access from any co @-@ knowledge .
he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradi@@ cting crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; non @-@ violent &quot; was to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral Spar@@ rows .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is charged in the report . &quot;
do he have to live with this privilege ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ on from sexual abuse and violent crimes and somewhere , in the middle of inside , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that &apos;s a mis@@ use of the report .
there is then clean separated : between pre@@ school and gymn@@ asi@@ um of dom@@ est@@ ants , between sexual abuse and violent crimes , as well as we say once , other pre@@ st@@ entions .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir manager of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ fic testing education , the cases where the boys of sa@@ c teachers were quite sus@@ pen@@ ed and dre@@ aming , all of them suffered during the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have ruled .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gramm@@ ar school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was how the very most witnesses empha@@ size the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : since it was already discipline , but no secret violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report concluded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates the general humanity of R. valued and thus in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the throw remains to have looked aw@@ ed at the most .
however , despite all efforts , the report could define just two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( such as the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
lost Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gramm@@ ar school , which the report even re@@ produces .
in this point , he insi@@ sted this point , &quot; that in the pre@@ school continues to be pract@@ ised . &quot;
in view of the risk of negative pres@@ sions , he recommended an urgent matter .
that was , of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as inspec@@ tions were banned in Bavaria .
before , they took place in a legal sky , like everyone else knows us .
it was also difficult for him to estimate , where the victims were perhaps ex@@ agger@@ ated or destroyed , and where really the allow@@ able limit had been exceeded .
but one can not say , he would have looked aw@@ ed ever .
that &apos;s just not correct .
only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we truly talk about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past to today &apos;s moral standards .
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , who had respect to all times , and not for what was bre@@ ached in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s bodies , that goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all very dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally processed .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , as all that had nothing to do with him .
its funds to discipline and pun@@ ishments , so ear@@ ne@@ cks and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
after the punishment of physical punishment , he was also strictly prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what has been played by George R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with you in the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of inspec@@ ting also related to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the dom@@ inium spar@@ kl@@ es just a secondary role .
but I didn &apos;t wear it , because he did not have a regim@@ ent there .
but this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world heritage , true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not make a big singer and stand before each success , right on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ conqu@@ ering .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks with their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep little faith and heart of good people , from which one could not imagine that he could not only do a fly with a fly .
I do get regularly with how many former domains would still come to him today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family .
those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
today , most dom@@ est@@ ants are grateful for him that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them near to the world of music .
and that he always became a good , v@@ ener@@ able teacher - a stringent father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up today and honour her .
and please , once again clearly stated : all that designs for him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have recently over@@ came this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is highly un@@ fair , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently for a more prominent brother to take a medi@@ al sinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evil intent that stands behind it , just too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the rising area would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace .
