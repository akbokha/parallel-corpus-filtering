<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münker promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not present.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everybody who had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi, instead of a Umrying road, displayed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern regional government, are all other than currently - but are very impressive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, it is clear that cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich office since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patch covering, which you can't know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the vast plain map for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was produced according to the Bavarian State Department, between 1810 and 1864, and jump in the first dimension of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800 the French army leader was occupied during the Second Coalition War in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon requested an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns, of course, for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops went up with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, today's neighbours, which created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph understood the project, founded" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Authority" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian Authority website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today, the example of the state capital is the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is substitution, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, joined the district in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, submissions is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses undertook to focus in 1856 along today's Plinganserroad, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the western park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming appears, a smaller map with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "Urination," derived from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "little plots present there today no farmers, but rather small gardener of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was the place of the Oktoberfest, in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete coast.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the primitive position, in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, reads not only the names of the street "at the lustrust" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road, one once represented people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenaissance "was created in the Auer ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that of the psychiatrist, who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the settes of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haider, who employed himself for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, and later was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the rotary indexes in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is there since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football pitch of TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built in an architectural style on the origin of the Irrenaissance that had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was" "" "main square" "", "the shopping street was called" "" "Kaufinger Street" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change caused by the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big still remained until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pits from the Middle Ages were once on Marienhof, where these days work and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil rights organization published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for supporting colored color has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminating politics and racist attacks by the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board, which is to come into force by August 28th, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, where you could have particular attention to the state as a number of fragmentary, terraced outages in the entire state and noted here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as prosecution of the state that are disproportionately upon minorities, said the Group to release the travel warning, "said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have the injuries of the civil rights, the human beings.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are defeated or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear symptoms in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group benefited as rassistic violence against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was charged by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by Missouri, which is shown that black drivers will keep 75 percent more common in the state." ""</seg>

<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring us, whether they bring Caution money or relatives, that they may travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">By the end of 2015, Missouri came out in Hasselt, according to the latest figures from Hasselt's report of the FBI to set the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th ranking of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states of immigration authorities undertake to impose the local law enforcement agencies which contribute to the ACLU to further development profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Changes are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Consecration project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisheries electric fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag, Peter White and Kordula Kovac was a picture taken place on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the reclamination of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the CDU city council met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann entered into its operation, in which he works 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young homes and in five apartments Ferienged accommodates.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwald milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, as swinging." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste only is regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the CHV-chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence project as "elementary."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit up on such steep sections.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area has a lot of work, much needs to be processed using the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have struggling with the conditions and to fight with the top photography," "" "emphasized off" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elicable operation and manage this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it lead no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the Leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers need to be supported at costs between 3000 and 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that, so that the refreshment of the faces could go out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their farm," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-based surface is 40 hectares, which can not be enforated by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">A quarter of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by the total of EUR 71 and a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers stay 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained andemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job without farmer and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White resists:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state community line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidecences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the opening of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR-drawn conveyor drop.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the inconsistency area must not be dragged (hangar above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the refreshment.</seg>
<seg id="95">Currently, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build a fence of 16 kilometres on the fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The conservation area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change-up, it is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciated this as well as any other - therefore the fall of Saddam Hussein's disappearance on the Firdos village in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, did certainly know what he did when he had a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not take the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty Imitators would have felt him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta implied: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct but how he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it concerns the contemporary response to the shaking words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only include any ancient immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "" "your rubble, your poor, and your oppressed masses, looking for free, / the end of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eletrash" was to be seen better on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary critique - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps America.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down in order to place her words after her death on the basis - knew quite good that they had completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism by showing the feminine caress of freedom in a worn classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The coupling with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this back long by the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great shout of Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not in fact, but rather an early Neoconservative that the American flame has to present into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine on the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh is down here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is wholly or even a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see how she was seen of the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective of creating Miller and Trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not shine on the way, but the hatred, who is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminds himself of a while when only two marries belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-person Scottish contingent quota will contribute to a solid contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland, something special" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find out until we find out." "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of things is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen from the team to team mates.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie entirely restored, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 scottos in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance Muir lead on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will be part of 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another grotto that one is looking for a great season to watch the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, as the only other grotto in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The management capitalists states that they "enormously proudly" on the fact that many of their compatriots are not only to the team, but in some cases also in the medals and with the finalists.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing about it is to be the team that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour to know that my teammates have voted for me and voted, makes it something special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podies.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech concerns as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So, it is really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and there will be a great atmosphere as out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not throw yourself a public office if you do not wear the heat of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of the domestic policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He implies with the criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken from - and, dumb and mute, we are led to the sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland at Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted the opinions on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union mourned for him in the early days of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor of the Governors rejected the lawsuit as a volvolution, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence of principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">It was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters, and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons appearing on the side of the governance - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary, and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hoess's spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governance and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the picture of trombals or spammers or hassaulted people who make search the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post said with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, rethinking, and not professed.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor wrote the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hassayed, but she asked to hate him.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other new messages," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people in the same theme takes place, then they are disregarded as a so-called" collective "and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the employees of the governors as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would others" "" "pronunciation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to assign a message by simply plugged into a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn with critical cuts and to stick or to sweat or to sweat.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that has just happened.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants that criticised for this, that he implies Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voters from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter driver beat his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"" "the people who used pseudonyms like" "" "Valerius," "" "Belisarius," "", "and" "" "Portius" "", "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised his position about the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed their ministry, according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Free speech, disagreements and discourses belong to our nation's basis.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly created bell stopped for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>

<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm broke the steeple and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was canceled.</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim refused" has prompted Landrat Andrew Coenen (CDU) to reuse its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Viersen, there is a wind power concentration camp at the time of Viersen.</seg>

<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">In the past summer, Viersens City Council gave green light to purchase three wind turbines at the wind farm Linnich in Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm plant in Übach-Palenberg district.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirements, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architecture and Design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill who had 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative in order to solve the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked on each other without paying a gaps." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It wasn't just a simple platform to build, but to put the steel so that it had the right height at the top or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For mezzanine, a classic copper window of Retrouvius can look down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of spider plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave it for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer space for all bestow and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Thanks to perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can connect the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering was there," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's important to use, so if you push the door, it is very easy to guide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the floor area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high-quality materials that make space for the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and they are helping to create an emotional relation in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square footage of a little more standard into something completely narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Indeed, as Joanne, you could decide to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar property</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a meditation due to one of the largest real estate markets Victorias, valued at over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former Director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business can be split.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on separation is held in the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - from Paul has described as "main driver and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial acts indicate that Colin made his own value of $316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading legal lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and held by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lucis and her late husband Luigi, Italian immigrants, dairy bars and delicacy stores from the late 1950-s and in the early seventies bought a business in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first day of working with leading employees, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trumps in white house that he wants to repair: bad information she is in the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that they should flow through it - whether on paper or lettering - because the President would make better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to counter cadres by supervising his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps on TV goes back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV coverage is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the contingent contended due to unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair reporting of places that were convincing," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politiken Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit under control, is to make sure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobster price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter has ever been under control "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this Kamper officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps is without their interventions could still contain more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, the drump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff might create it some times, anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trout controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house that communicating from competing parties, always try to introduce their own agenda by promoting cadence material that may improve their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - all with this story - reported in May on the preference of advising advising the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it descends to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when someone willing to recharge a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the Website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster to be at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false allegations in the past, and refuted them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "in addition, Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the trump" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that be folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still seeking influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make the Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin to have targeted in the 2010 presidential campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigation, several men are supposed to act as an advisor to the republicers of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a private and more boldly private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote some weeks ago that the special issuer Trump personally put into the center and search the accusation if the president may have disabled the justice in the course of the affair.</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the creation of the Greatum of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the West Arctic, a giant iceberg broke out from the scarring scarcely seven times in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhaven-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometer large colonel is driven out now to the north and will probably be two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is one of 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest iceders that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people will not go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">However, when climate change has played a role in the crash of iron, research information is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, there has been a series of unusual clashes of ice-ovens in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a Fakent background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many scientists, this can be combined with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colon had previously been a part of the Larsen-C flock.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Crawls are floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Therefore it grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelbow is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this flock was the balance of waxing and abrupt a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete crawler-like may fall there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It is quite a lot to say that the Larsen-C flock's risk is in danger, because the front edge never withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Furthermore, the iron plate arise in tension and can be broken down, if there be a piece of a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of cheline and ice-berg increases the sea level not because they swim in the water and pushed the ice as much water as it yields the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of a seal is that the glacier can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">After AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelmelt is the fourth largest scarcity of Antarctica according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although there is a natural event and does not have direct connection to climate change, the ice sign comes in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most widely retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is contested whether the Larsen-C flock are back-up or come back in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckly said, and added: "our models tell us that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not withdraw this gigantic ice vineyard on climate change, so in the past decades, many ice floats of the Antarctic peninsula are broken down.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long section of the Antarctica stretches for South America.</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is safe to need.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbed has also been dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport, because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions you can also find in classical sports, for example, increased heart frequencies, stress-actions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Besides, it contains cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a speedy response.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the consultancy firm Deloitte and the Federal Ministry of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) reported rapid growth in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly over advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ichockey," write the Deloitte consultant.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most published cartoons draftsmen, the bustibles of his figures are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85% of Argentina he is still working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he presented himself as a drawing for happiness postcards by what he asked him frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Ever again the artist had inspired him to inspire cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, dish mordillo-figures were strolling in drawings with the push tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits on drawing, working day almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Klein, t-shirts, plush animals and watches can continue its drooping figures as much distribution worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence, threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the reproducible conditions and because of diseases-borne insects, which scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions to find great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM was in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively vulnerable, because the plant had been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has much less rain in the spring, and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transfers Zwergzikades, and with very dry weather there is a lot of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil isn't only enough for vacationers, it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and weakened either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">To the solutions that are considered, include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the testing of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to dry.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly magazine Riodoce will normally meet on Wednesdays in order to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and uncessory drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of a attack with grenades in 2009 or let them go home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a plaque in front of the room: opponents, neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdomen feeling.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug gglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, journalists who are suspected of making the state of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no breaks of violence, and throughout the country there are more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 stood after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now, there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word "Justice" on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-Shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to handle the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most thousands of murders, who are linked every year with drug trafficking and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists are rarely put in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodosice, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unsafe and although the territory is still avenged.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security is little useful, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why we trust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the Office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with the "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter tossed in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be able to rob in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is nothing but silence on the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not take that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people will be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of delayed, two-story molaters for drug royal, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal states with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60) was a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings has contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of a interview with the Damo Lopez, a leader of a rivalist cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans children.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the children, assumed power members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in it, Valdez did not force to force after the arrest of another newspaper, which had made the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism, without pushing on the cradote of poison," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper picked up a reputation for courageous and honourable reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish tough final studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat them.</seg>
<seg id="1849">She received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for eight years after the formation of Riodoce, "she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In that same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in tracking the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the presence of many dead... Why did you not say what went ahead?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse the boyfriend, the friend, generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar from the office, going to sit still at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine labor?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to ask their own assumptions to question, how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their little shops, their home-and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-retreat and self-maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells, stay away, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, no longer than in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, where a toxic mix of lucrabs, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce came to safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it was known that Spyware, who is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside were two policemen outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-piece building in Culiacan in a central part of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half of the shear, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who described the governor himself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape, where drug are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has knitted on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the national spending, which focused on the home town of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite site of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter had learned from public recordings that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which prevailed almost all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Most recently, several PRI governors were charged with corruption due to high-calibre cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarr asked the reporter for writing in this eating house, among them one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "was a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something of what they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez on a few signs and walked in the next morning at a demonstration due to another journalist at the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame vanished three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and civil servants say, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become loudly in the whole country by writing journalists in organized Protects "SOS Press" on walking and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and bring them to the truth, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has so asked that she is subdivided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico took place of organizational crimes against the government officials and a similar society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who put together the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of severe earump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you blinded only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that they slept" "", "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal typorell Museum, where the creature has to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science than one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with a rupulsion, resembles a changing tank that was probably threatened by meat-consuming dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily damaged dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paragliding technology that is known as antilically, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to avoid itself better in its surroundings and to soften their enemies, experts predict that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now shown in the Royal typorell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and munitions on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the confrontation is customary, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals live today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs are hunted enough pressure by flesh-ether dinosaurs that the evolution of the confrontation was beneficient as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals, who have the confrontation - think of deer or shear-animals - are much less and infringing as a prey, what is indicated that this nodosing was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong pirate behaviour on a massive, strongly armoured Dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs had to have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his fourth performer, to find out what it did as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on the back of the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta has been as warm as Southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosing rier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserving your skin but also maintained in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you throw only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal baths, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth was gone through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured Dinosaurs was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">The Acrocanthosaurus belongs to this, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists who appear the latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death in the sea and in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio, when he died on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant carnivores was inhibited by the Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded in the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well received, that the skin step is still going to cover heavy tank panels along the dinosaurs</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, the love and power of power that consists of the strength and resistance of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell passed with her daughter, who had a cauliflower and a suitable crown, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even though I was lucky to give her a experience in which she personally experienced not a eklatant racism, it is not different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police agency, which became a campground, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have connected with local business partners, which made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As follows in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, have not centered their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">The post had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism over death-insect inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was to focus on Ferreling's experience - in order to show that it is not a messiah leader, but about a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, how she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain creditors in this work and in human purposes of black people." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern outskirts of the pedestrian zone has been spinning as the population of advocate and opponents in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject hardly makes it cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents make sure that a gallery goes to more customers into the city, the rest of which also benefit from the rest of the city, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the plot, on which the farm market stands, in which 13 direct marketing will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will end with the start of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall to the new building - and to the Beda square with opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the women are always happy to come back.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drills or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty here - some have been standing for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a ordinary weekly market, it is all more important that at least the Markthalle will remain at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because all the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is indeed inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores are rented in a shopping center only of larger firms, because the rentals are often not portable for a single retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops there is almost no longer and what is still left, then will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle fits not for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit for Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery gets actually at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost-gallery previously, to drive out all the shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it's just not going to work.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But there is no space for a farmhouse... thanks to the mad many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmhouse is done, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unlimited - which depend on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupes and Hair Pieces, which were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysts decided to serve a 35-year-old prison after having opened diplomatic news about the site WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, means A Becoming Residential (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and discourteous disco whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look like man with these genomic data, a sharp, if also something intellectual comments could not only be created for the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinations of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born when Bradley Edward was born, but has already been informed about the identification as a woman in 2013, including six charges against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is sitting uncomfortable on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde pergap - which she has been associated with her.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Therein, the artist portrays the portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts, such as cigarette stubborn and chewing gum, extracted in the DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of what these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the point where she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg stated at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit that time, and she couldn't shoot at this time, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were invited to uncover letters that replaced several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a shoot of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "supplemental images," which would be able to convert a future in which the president of Chelcide would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter ways to fix the rigid creams, which he had to fix it further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things are going to happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a wall written on the wall of the gallery written Manning with its superior signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation would have been sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and an Ace, written in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuclear otide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishing, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully will be able to take care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, trace back Memories, can also be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is one page from the top of the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it dives with a free-free fall in the hand of the disciplines of the United States of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of wholesome human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binding era of the trump era, that the political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, have also split families in small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and thanksgiving, there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horrors of Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly tried to burst into our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices have been noticed by power Trumps, family.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-aligned poetic, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republics in our family for a long time this week has visited me in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everybody knows whom she knows, including the Republican relationship that had fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks to itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency has the power to push all the right to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and tear, we refer to the graceable possibility that our kittens of one day could no longer stumble.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, there is a long-term long-term scenario, in which the bump of Republicans of the right wing, "normalizes that suddenly in comparison to its standards, suddenly appear as a statement of deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romantic version of decay - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in fact occur as a very mild criminal.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carussers of New York's Park department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in town, if no caffeine needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals are turning to watch full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the collient music gives it a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not just a righteous man.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day, when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage in fact - the themes-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karussel is still a strange magical experience, since two two years old, a 11-year old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel I would have given him a full score, but fortunately nobody asked them.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand I was compelled to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale ranging from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In a coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to purchase the rating with a 15% tip to purchase anything about the cargo table.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what was actually a neutral exchange, but also executing pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excused, while I tired the experience, you submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to put an appeal against the six-year-old prison sentence from Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too lent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national law enforcement authorities said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa against the objection, and the objection may be heard this year.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate may sound for your digestion system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases might relieve the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unthinkable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causes magnets and blowers, recurring or bloody rains, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the subjects are normally debated to relieve flesh and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid of tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestine patented, to ensure that harmful microbes hide themselves in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of solvent inflammation are compensated by cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance of conveyance immunodeficiency occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in its initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the buildings of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intryptophan diet can tolerate food tolerant, less anti-inflammatory intestine, if the same system is also affected by humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan visited a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mages such cells had such cells, but there was another group of the same tribe that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They thought that the difference to do with the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The poorer of mice were DNA sequenced, and there were found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in a sterilitary environment, so that a gut microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immaturation cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells evolves to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-Metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people are able to tolerate the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri on our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan products from L. reuteri the cells in humans develop like in mice but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>

<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House requested the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would need for return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2842">According to the police, the men of the 13-year-old said they talked to friends at the Kolpingstraße, at 14.55 a.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl's mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="2849">One trade union would like to make sure about the long term commitment of the Biscite-manufacturer McVitie about the long term commitment to produce in their work in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland stated that the company had silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="2851">More than 500 employees work in the work, next to other products hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.</seg>
<seg id="2852">McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "he added that employees and trade union representatives" "" "would be first experienced when their activities would change." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">In a letter to the branch of the company GMB Scotland McVitie's demanded, "concerns that financing to modernize production lines will not be driven forward."</seg>
<seg id="2855">GMB-Senior-Organisator Drew Duffy, said: "the fact that we can win no clarity of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross country, affecting our members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">Generations of families have been working here and the labour force concentrating strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Hence, under the perspective of jobs, wage and prosperity, and from the background of the Brexite, the rising civil service costs and the chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a floral productive presence at McVitie. "</seg>
<seg id="2858">A spokesperson from Pladis said: "the Filiale of Tollcross has only received a letter of GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it, since we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions have been openly discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2860">We discussed with the employees that we are like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, check our businesses constantly - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="2861">"" "they added:" "" "in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements." ""</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in its pursuit of Neymar, after having given an offer of £189 million in order to resolve his overhead lines, but in Barcelona they have been warned about three years before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has created the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1-Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2868">Barcelona is mad about the way, as Neymar has enforced its way to outside, although a source near the Catalans board is that the club always has its best in order to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the soccer world warned about three years ago by the PSG president in front of this view?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for the club to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know when they touch one of our players, then we will be standing in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domora Sparrows Report Holds pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger DompleSparrows report to the abuse rubbish by Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abbrewing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to be held for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisseng, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained in the publication opposite the German Press Agency, as well as President Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the quoted Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret over their own omissions or their back assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In contrast, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that the coverage about violence in the Domatzen with "two measures" would be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "as regards the attacks in Regensburg, no one would have to prevent" "" "shameful and damaged deeds" "", "which would be punished and prevented in the future;" "" "the degree of media manipulation," "" "the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and is preparing the public opinion that" "" "says Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis explained in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk." "" "we will gladly go on to the church and this is a" "" "frescoes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a whole ordinary educational media" "" "to be done with naughty children, just as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They have been unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abbreaches, Pope John Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports about the abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger" "" "My Brother of Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese of Regensburg to the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In total, a total of 547 Regensburger Dominion had been used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plotted vity "victims of overprint, 67 Domdonatzen sexually abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, this means that from the Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">In the case of a high emotional level, the punishment for the pupils could be even more ferocious.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other claims, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. valued and thus in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explained why the final report to the abbrewery andal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protective devices, is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one lift up many students in his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it also appears as a cholesterol and perfectionist, which became the economist, when a domain name was not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask more, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are only eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear from any suspicion of the mid- or dowsing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violent interest at the preschool was held outside of its active sector.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can throw it at all, too late, or have not taken the first reference to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domenatzist grammar school, on which he worked, was recognized by virtually all the respondents - "Redemption," heaven "and" better world ".</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent record," "" "excellence," "", "" "" "competent," "" "and" "" "discreet" "", "as very goodly teachers who provided the boys regularly with cake, biscuits and bonds" "" "and" "" "always" "" "of grapes from children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotions, which also led to cheutout breaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't just crave on the ground with chairs and threw the keywords, but also put out ear-like boys to the hair or ears, he has already admitted already years ago, deeply regretted and have been disapologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must, however, must be said that such guardians methods in the fragrant period, in the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a national high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it's actually about in this report, namely, the terrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool are the free excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">It is wondering if it does not want to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media had just collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never did him understand might still be zealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entrails Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, it was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Cathedral Sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also have any processing or knowledge with regard to sexual abuse of burden?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have been entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a subject of interested in the others," "" "It was all very embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and sisters, then definitely not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we evaluate the Dominion students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioning student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had enough findings in which he would have been unable to stop (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been unable to stop the appropriate perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for real absurd, to assume that it is calculated to be insistent or clearer, or rather reopened, compared to their parents, internatsmanagers, confidentials, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "in advance, people affected and / or their surrounding areas could not be confirmed in the context of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">So, for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is then to access from any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicting crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "non-violent" was to be read at the Regensburger Cathedral Sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is charged in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this privilege?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melon from sexual abuse and violent crimes and somewhere, in the middle of inside, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that's a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is then clean separated: between preschool and gymnasium of domestants, between sexual abuse and violent crimes, as well as we say once, other prestentions.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir manager of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrific testing education, the cases where the boys of sac teachers were quite suspened and dreaming, all of them suffered during the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domenatzist grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "that was how the very most witnesses emphasize the subject" "" "preschool" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and many even "paradigic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domenatzist grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: since it was already discipline, but no secret violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report concluded that" "" "many victims" "" "estimates the general humanity of R. valued and thus in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the throw remains to have looked awed at the most.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could define just two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (such as the witness) would not hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Lost Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domenatzist grammar school, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this point, he insisted this point, "that in the preschool continues to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the risk of negative pressions, he recommended an urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as inspections were banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they took place in a legal sky, like everyone else knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate, where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or destroyed, and where really the allowable limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he would have looked awed ever.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to use today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we truly talk about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger of the past to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, who had respect to all times, and not for what was breached in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's bodies, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very dreadful and I'm glad that it is finally processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, as all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds to discipline and punishments, so earnecks and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">After the punishment of physical punishment, he was also strictly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what has been played by George Ratzinger during the talks with you in the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of inspecting also related to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI's Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the dominium sparkles just a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">But I didn't wear it, because he did not have a regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without which unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world heritage, true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, you do not make a big singer and stand before each success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-conquering.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during talks with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and beyond, I've experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, deep little faith and heart of good people, from which one could not imagine that he could not only do a fly with a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I do get regularly with how many former domains would still come to him today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him - he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most domestants are grateful for him that he enriches their lives and brought them near to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always became a good, venerable teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up today and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly stated: all that designs for him are guardians methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have recently overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"" "but it is highly unfair, a man, just because it is prominently for a more prominent brother to take a medial sinner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is evil intent that stands behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the rising area would be a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not have to know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace.</seg>
