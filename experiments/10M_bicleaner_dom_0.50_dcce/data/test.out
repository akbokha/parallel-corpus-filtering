gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyramid .
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little confusion with some colleagues on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses were greeted on their holiday , they pursued in the fast Gal@@ opp home to the feeding pipe .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses .
he led himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not take a photo of photography .
this was the first time in Aachen and with the Chi@@ o for the first time .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
Federal President , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already warned him .
it is the 18th winner of the pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sports fans the two @-@ time US master winner was included in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the interpre@@ tations belong to the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gi@@ enger , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , who is a pupp@@ y of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of all Erhard .
many of these sporting activities came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively Society emigrated to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are , however , with the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton lies the basic , rather philosop@@ hi@@ cal distinction between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton .
the one , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns against it , as the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton commits to death the economy and regulate the economy , he says .
he , on the other hand , would be different , claims guided .
he will reg@@ ain works massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates , and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the wealthy are increased , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , they say , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost what is the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ ual te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , at Tr@@ ump , you could still come up with an internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and return to the USA .
oil extraction has also been possible to dis@@ agree in protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
Clinton wants to expand and expand renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ ort@@ less trade agreement , will both not sign .
both of them , however , don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
they are supposed to be paid better then , for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US Dollars is a hunger re@@ warding .
she wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not very clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he shall not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to stim@@ ulate the economy and citizens wants to stim@@ ulate growth .
his critics keep it before him , that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the wealthy , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is for women who flee alone , almost as for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they often are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her small son into the arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother per@@ ple@@ xed to the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
they sm@@ iled short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area of business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief activities in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are plum@@ bing .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all@@ po@@ aged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s ambul@@ ance .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no other men - either not as visitors .
the exception is a qu@@ arian in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ agger@@ ated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted , because of them commit torture or death , or because their families send them as hopes for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for women , there are other reasons for escape : &quot; many steal secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ g for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they were an@@ ci@@ ed in Germany , B@@ ahr .
even here , single women in refugee camps would often have been considered as inferior or mis@@ used .
this leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north , are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women believed that they were nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the awakening , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often do not have to help themselves , they need more accommodations only for them , calling B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments for the accommodation of refugees are responsible .
on the question of whether they st@@ aff@@ le from a similar project as in Munich , some of them will answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in shel@@ ters of governments .
in Schw@@ aben , alone , women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ ver of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are two floors or their homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is missing the privacy or become female and women together , it can go to - for@@ aging - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower rooms should be separated and accessible to women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women sense this protective need , you can read on the And@@ re , which there will be at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haus in Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new labour action
Deputy Chairman of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour action in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has asked its entire council to appro@@ ve more labour measures in early September .
the J@@ DC said that there would be a minister , to worry about concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed to agree on the ref@@ usal of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted for elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday night , the president of J@@ DC &apos;s Ellen Court said that the government had remained quietly &quot; at problems , which led to the agreement that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC executive board has voted to complete the proposed new contract and concerns official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working measures , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance in this year was six times , the first overall accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ wana became head of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants after the election to re@@ jection of the agreed order conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions who were still held in front of the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and media positions that the contract was adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted .
after the vote of the health minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ top in the g@@ ild@@ ed room of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot forbid that Ankara wants to fight that reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ cra@@ dle , yes .
but the sm@@ iles had a nar@@ rower and very little heat from himself , even for its behaviour .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an said to be repeated by his &quot; love friend &quot; - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had heard so da@@ ze would never happen anything .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable conservation showed that the state of State of Russia had not forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his execution : the shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border was Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ less .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back .
the error was even bigger , because it was perpet@@ rated by a boy@@ friend .
the v@@ et@@ ries again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry the blame for everything .
on the serious test , the accus@@ ations of senior officials have benef@@ ited that Earth &apos;s own family have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disputed this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting only took place , because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first line all the friends who he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are economic motives .
Russian sanctions are hard to hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number of revolutions decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facil@@ itated when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal suit of the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television approved cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ ag@@ r@@ ines are not allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is en@@ ra@@ ged on the West , since it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power of power as weak response .
to this end , the continuing Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ cking on it is to pull out the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian State Staff won a bonus to ensure that he demanded the attempted coup support for the selected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well known for Moscow remembers a matter of agreement , which itself has a deeply seated fear of regim@@ es .
the summit in this splendid palace of the sea made it possible to illustrate Russia and Turkey , as it described me a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of out@@ side &quot; : two countries that are dealt and badly treated from the West , and now ob@@ liter@@ ate themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support the contrary to Turkey .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks at the press conference , both of them had said that they had not even ri@@ pens on the subject .
the President of Turkey failed to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months , host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey killed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Management Board , the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand has joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ ressed and saved nearly eight years ago , and had to be saved .
in this time brand new brand &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all the RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange can change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other different brands for private clients who receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a sight@@ seeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be participating at our Invest@@ ors &quot; mark and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; among which our employees will be busy , as we are now going to be a bank of stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS has become the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we are unable to track any global goals but are local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these stamps will be completely different for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing will no longer pursue any more and will be able to increase the perception of various brands in its sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , as we are in the interior ( we asked ) to do this for a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch this stamps again , therefore I think that the time has come .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family also is here
I am very happy about that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I &apos;m reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori decreases the Ju@@ bel , as he brings the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ ri@@ er@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best yo@@ jo@@ ckey of modern times , and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
it has style and is powerful , but it is its tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusiastic fans for this sport for years .
in a few weeks , in Ep@@ s@@ om , Frank@@ ie said that he had already brought 6,000 wins if it would not only be one weekend and big tournaments !
Frank@@ ie already attracted nearly 30 years of winning players in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ished to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the hanging plate of the British flat base for two decades .

a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ stru@@ ct his two @-@ fl@@ es and to return to its best .
and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue studying at competitive up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian President Putin fired &apos;s Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin was released un@@ expect@@ edly to his staff , Serge@@ j Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to special responsibility for environmental and transport affairs .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it says that Putin has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Est@@ onian capital , Tallinn , in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
in the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a member of the officer and Office of the government &apos;s execution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin on his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state for law and inspec@@ tions on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin distributed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his position and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the sm@@ iling faces convince ?
this step did not work mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ j Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest to Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was aired on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request .
but despite the smile on the cameras for the cameras , just a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power fighting ?
no one knows that .
but the official statement - that a man who once had been glorified as a potential president , would like to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed to great scep@@ ti@@ cism .
in his remarks on Putin who are cited in the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you to talk in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ained for four years .
as it emer@@ ges , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov was the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the Security Council of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onal Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed chairman of the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin was used to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , to whom he trusted in most .
once again , Ivan@@ ov could assume the second term of President of Russia in Ivan@@ ov after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this item was taken from another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became President three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired when he proposed producers
Gibson was involved last month at a physical conflict on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common opinion its termination .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , pleaded not guilty to the public on Thursday before the announcement of his termination .

rid@@ dle about fish , which landed in Ban@@ ff garden
a few of Ban@@ ff &apos;s inhabitants called for the identification of the fishes , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be a s@@ orting process at 75 fish , which were sp@@ out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope that someone might throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queens@@ way Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be completed in order to approach every of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ lan@@ ders .
the project &apos;s £ 1.@@ 35 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
the site Minister Keith Brown presented a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the Queens@@ tical cross trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a truly epic trend in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a hei@@ r@@ able activity that require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the entire bridge cuts in its place and the last section of the de@@ cks is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge .
Michael Martin , project director of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure of the future is pioneering high and deep ground .
following the installation of the last street tr@@ ams and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap between the North or the land .
this was achieved by pulling in the northern periph@@ er@@ brücke 700 millimetres south .
this was a massive and very delicate work at the same time .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at an incline of about 3 % upwards .
even the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat in front of Fis@@ her@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved in from its own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its proximity to turned and made us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds have stopped the boat beyond their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a Bo@@ je without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coast rescue service and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky enough to be still alive and still alive .
although the boat engine had a Not@@ stop@@ pl@@ one , however , this dis@@ band@@ ed the boat from the bo@@ ots of the person , which ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously injured - man sti@@ ff@@ ered on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get the key to get his personal things .
instead , the in@@ tox@@ ins cut off the clothing of his ex @-@ friend instead .
when they came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed to her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could take the killer .
while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed inter@@ vened the sister of his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it , but abandoned the apartment .
and therefore she went out with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ lifetime companion of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old was his sister to his side and handle his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ger apartments ?
the SPD and Green Party say : investors will be much stronger into the duty in future .
how can you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; manual concept plan &quot; next to the next rating session .
but the dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question arises : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build up 20 percent of all apartments on urban areas in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments may also arise in the inventory .
the big dispute in the town hall was , however , the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban development program , which will cost millions of costs and has to be financed , is supposed to be an incentive to inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left hand plans to reduce fin@@ s for investors .
regardless of what , as a fr@@ ying , the flag is a dis@@ car@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet altogether : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one make loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to get back into the price connection again .
this is possible in the western city .
in one stroke the problem would be solved .
because in the western city go to the end of the year Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is what the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social dwellings in the western city is dramatically increased , one removes from the goal of the so called pass mixture .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in only a few districts .
the Green Party fore@@ see that there is still movement in the discussion .
leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go with the boat . &quot;
although I concentrated on more sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it &apos;s amazing to watch how the world is changing .
that teenagers and children go no longer to play outside , but rather , prefer to spend their free time , on screens , has been lam@@ ented in the last decade of many .
for Pok@@ em@@ on Go , people are going to get from the sofa and get more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app which is based on the character , which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
as many phenomena of populations sank the interest in the publication of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved through massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go received more users than god@@ children , and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smart phones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who were tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found once they were taken &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35,000 users after the launch of the game , that within two days after the introduction of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 per cent every day .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take it up to 30 minutes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being actively bo@@ red for health , because many public messages are boring to health and to come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sports , its chances to get ill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon go is that it brings people out to do something in the open , that makes them fun .
there are therefore three pillars of the health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even close new friends on the hunt .
as always there are also vanity games , which must always be more difficult to compl@@ ain .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has got a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the usage is repeated with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos; success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thi@@ er .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beams .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on full line .
and now the Olympic champion finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast from Thursday to multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ il on the pig @-@ bal@@ ancing during the retail trade show during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of its generation or even ever .
she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long trip ended at that moment .
it is this success in the same league how unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates its sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue dog from her said that she is the best gymn@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting their last review in Brazil , a competition that went not as much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas back , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American women of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them , after they have won gold and silver in a multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the farewell celebration of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as a pro@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ ba@@ it insi@@ sted on top of it , during their long run on the top of having never seen the future , it is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mother during a school trip to the gym , in Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became power .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no multi @-@ fight competition for more , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , the picture destroyed .
pig bal@@ ances and soil seeds - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world .
they returned again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ des - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them as she had expected her end to her end - a pure form of shape and tears , in a gl@@ oss@@ y red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision described it once in their collective book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was an reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Mu@@ cab@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ a , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , had a lead .
after their soil exercise , they cast down the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as a consequence , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et has a very new meaning quickly spread out of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial mur@@ dering when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot and killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix , while they stayed in the car and heard music .
Angela in Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked during a drive .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told that the triple of the murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of an adult victims .
the police pre@@ acher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting shows the investig@@ ators to investigate whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months of nine attacks and two more wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to dis@@ close the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are associated and were perpet@@ rated by the same murderer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit down and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting , which led to an empty pic@@ up truck an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators discovered Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the headquarters as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ concepts : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys , and of course his mother .
but just like the f@@ ew@@ est of its aging , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic distur@@ b@@ ance that did not know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home first time , my first thought , I create that .
I do not create that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what does not vote at all -- of course you left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they advanced to institutional use .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a aid .
Edmund couldn &apos;t sit or cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run and cycling with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the language that Edmund von &quot; Please check something out &quot; for me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will tell him character pron@@ unci@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ concepts has a number of causes : genetic as well as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the cy@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will influence the life of the infected people with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an un@@ conscious future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she really doesn &apos;t know .
I had no longer asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is getting better .
they know they will be better for you .
you will love your child and love your child .
severe ra@@ ins , flooding gives cause to b@@ ail@@ ments in Louisiana , Mississippi
severe flooding and large @-@ scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to pron@@ ounce the emergency on Friday . it will count all day over with more rainfall .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the T@@ pp@@ is flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale flooding in extreme rainf@@ alls , the national weather service reported .
the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards said that officials in constant contact with local authorities have already been on the way and the aid of the affected communities had already been on the way .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness , dealt with , shared by the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service had to be allowed to fall in this area an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
in the South of Alab@@ ama the Fl@@ ut@@ ist system was deployed on Friday , while it continues to rain in the mobile network .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , who are located both in Louisiana , will reach all probability far beyond the weekend record level .
the Met@@ ge@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that there is a danger on the down@@ stream in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish a danger , since these rivers run only slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 am the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams continue to take people from the Fl@@ ut@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rising rapidly by night .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives in the vicinity , would have been warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aw@@ aken and poured out the water and came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a blast of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls there was to consider the authorities of evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann there was a observer in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that , through the rain , the ground has been considerably reduced since Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ affiliated radio station WW@@ L reported that an ordin@@ ate in tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded homes .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now over@@ flooded them .
the pre@@ sidents of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were killed 72 people and seven pets , that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ices were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of streets were closed , due to the flooding and sand@@ bags for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to become a similar incident .
in the group , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues to ra@@ ining the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses should have been reported on Thursday as over@@ flooded , but on Friday they have not been reported yet .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Sh@@ op@@ per &apos;s Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; sol@@ dered by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is fired .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shots , including in the lim@@ b , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at a consciousness during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sol@@ dered by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ it@@ z distributed the transmitter to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just cannot believe that .
the state of the boys was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter that it is likely to recover .
he had to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
there were also three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are under C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the young was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators split C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cruise between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who were tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , ski@@ pped the tat@@ too .
it seems that it is clearly tra@@ cked for a lasting struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walking distance , were divisions .
it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said police surgeon Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police currently reviewed , according to reports , the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ el@@ ter at the arm while she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie :
that &apos;s what I imagine among the Women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ns and that of more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three turbul@@ ences , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which was inspiring for many young girls of other skin .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Madison Co@@ cian , is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it used the black and h@@ is@@ anal female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one under female Tur@@ ner@@ ves was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ly Gy@@ ma@@ stics .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ fight event for women .
Mann@@ a member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we will not see gymn@@ ast@@ ics in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic champion will only have four turbul@@ ences in the team . in addition , it is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Turner at first place in private gy@@ ne@@ akers , which are intended for training , setup , travel agent , competition , and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and family ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses , Turner will receive their whole training and for families a dev@@ our@@ ful and long term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to in@@ gest the municipalities of Au@@ burn inn@@ umer@@ able , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide a more efficient and easy accessible gymn@@ asi@@ fication .
I have founded my train@@ ee from 20 years ago .
during my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 permanent youth ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns to learn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of the crew , who bring thousands of young girls to become interested in Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team of Team and thank you , so many young girls are motivated to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize further strikes after they refused Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal rejected
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute with the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants refused to vote for a vote .
in July H@@ unt plans have revealed the Treaty of forced , and said that the N@@ HS was to be tra@@ ded in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be dam@@ aging to any further delay for employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance times .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ memor@@ andum for assistance divided last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants had serious concerns , in particular that it will heat up the current occupancy of today and to meet all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining before the first group of doctors remain under the new lease , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A on the solution of disputes by discussions took part in the government &apos;s response and sometimes ris@@ ked up on o@@ gan@@ ged silence .
this happened in a ren@@ unci@@ ation , that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had done last month for the last month , that his door would always be revealed .
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now , raising the im@@ pregn@@ ation and concerns the wor@@ ries of the assistance . &quot;
if he should not do this , then the assistant doctors have made apparent that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a de@@ formation of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , because nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved in order to grant physicians on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the modifications by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to be a better week of lessons for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are to be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , demanded the assistance of the assistant to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures do not achieve anything but only little , but only over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to me the Com@@ edy of assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health and other Minist@@ ries positively charged on concerns in terms of the pre@@ m@@ acy and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ one .
the employer trusted that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - including post@@ ing , flexibility for training , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - a sign that were serious , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , which can lower the heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after the authorities have been recommended to say more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulations for four years is recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulations for four years is recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by penetration of fet@@ al materials in the arter@@ ies , which form the cover@@ ings .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks out , it may cause a blood pressure to stop the blood flow through to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it may flow through the blood stream , flow the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , are subject to higher risk of having another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ des and is distributed under the trading name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces the risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the corporate design by Nice , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily dose of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the Nice Health Author@@ isation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ stro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effective in the reduction of other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
thanks to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . acceptance bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness suggests voting rights in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption of the ministry .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim municipalities know how a devastating government report today revealed .
the ex @-@ Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les , allied to the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence of voting rights due to &quot; sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption operation , said that it should be allowed to establish failure from elec@@ tors from elec@@ tors to the police , to establish un@@ locked voters outside of electoral cabins .
he recommends that voters should take a reference to their identity in order to prove their identity .
at present a voters must merely call its name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their constitu@@ ents to prevent anyone twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he requires that the press should have access to the municipal documents and decisions made of non @-@ official commissions or working groups .
&quot; it is not only opposed to electoral fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial glob@@ es that is associated with it , &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special voting court decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should ab@@ rupt after a lit@@ any and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic damages to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , led to the basis that it is a duty to choose from Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a desc@@ endant , where one person cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of dec@@ eit in all the country .
in particular , he expressed itself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to cleanse the election system , including the guiding of instru@@ ctors to prove the identity
in its report , it was said : &quot; as a proof , the pressure on protective needs of some ethnic minorities was administered , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with par@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or criminal off@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have such behavi@@ ours because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensitivity regarding eth@@ no@@ isse@@ ur and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to cleanse the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist writing documents , in order to stop &quot; pol@@ ling . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ a , requires even tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social orientation .
options consider to ask voters in front of your ID card .
do not use the ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have given their voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are in@@ eligible .
a three year limitation on requests to an automatic re @-@ election .
prohibition that political activists were able to edit full national elections and envel@@ opes .
the police give the power to establish o@@ ons for election stations .
a change of legislation , which facilit@@ ates the indictment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the People Act 1983 re@@ Repres@@ entation Act , 1983 .
photographer banned in electoral stations .
requirements that only be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees take the rule to follow the elec@@ tors alone in the elections .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voting court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy head to corrupt and illegal practices and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a number of reasons , it was not guilty according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
he is also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ ove &quot; checks of the election divisions of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud inheritance in the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral fraud and leu@@ g@@ n of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ speaking and other famous Double Fun@@ ders of Olympic acceler@@ ators in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics are held in Rio this week via the French Rad@@ athl@@ ete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of edge and band , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games in this summer is by far not the only one who has his own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not if you must give the social media .
honour@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , F@@ EM@@ A@@ IL has created a list of Olympic risks that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the hunter and the wolf : Mann@@ a member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides the course of double @-@ common on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people on the Internet are pointing out how a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght of Twitter causing images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ et@@ op got the ma@@ dness in the social media and gave it to hear that he has been listening to Leo ever since his childhood .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except the face of visual hair@@ y , &quot; said Bra@@ dy in the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons ever since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into the centre : the noticeable simil@@ arity between the British @-@ j@@ umper Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast of Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is to pass through as a double @-@ teacher for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African @-@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one speed higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another further comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and A@@ ctor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sunny skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not only one hear@@ ted : a Twitter user was very happy about it , that others also liked the simil@@ arities .
they are active in the space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user declared its cont@@ ent@@ ment that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope &quot; Solo and the Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter is an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , who is almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alists in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , that shows her own wonderful , wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ igh@@ ting cre@@ ams leave their own opinions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ators of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connector , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot;
too excited , went down like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers on Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Kan@@ adas Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the can@@ adian to close the gap to China .
viewers in the whole of Canada quickly re@@ acted after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Hat of the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swimming pool from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot has not been broken because they were still on stream . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m fre@@ igh@@ ting cre@@ ams for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connector , baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s Twitter came quickly and hard , at which many ordered him to talk about .
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter writer Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you only know the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all like ra@@ cists look . # attached .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC , broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment on a swimming pool was broadcast . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , it is sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC informed us at the end of more than 90 times in the people who have been respon@@ ding to the retirement on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator@@ ial Scott Rus@@ sel had to exc@@ use in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ uses for more than 90 other Twitter U@@ sers , who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed very quickly and gave a message .
we regret , we regret that these statements were made , and that it was possible that they will be aired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we quickly warned us yesterday night with our viewers on the show and our followers in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clari@@ fy one clear , B@@ yr@@ ons comments on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and did not stop them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron does that which he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in@@ quired of the broadcast and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment in order to ap@@ ologi@@ ze me for the commentary in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I entered the s@@ wimm@@ ers on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and did not go to them as a person . &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regard , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark emp@@ tied over woman , sitting in the middle of business sh@@ am@@ less under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman attracted their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try the under@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ ms the situation , and numbered them , as she saw them , and put them back in the shelf .
you are looking ahead and tasted four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , at .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before she placed it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under the under@@ wear , &quot; she insi@@ sted on og and the business , without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of sub@@ p@@ ants from the outside , moved their own strings and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even tried to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she retired the tro@@ users who didn &apos;t like it , because she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t feel anything , she turned into og and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not distur@@ bing that she observed someone - or more about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as opposed to think any under@@ p@@ ants would take home with home , that one had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I got along , the employees have tried to draw the pieces from the sale after she went - what &apos;s as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of sub@@ tro@@ users to home and find out that another woman she had her and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident , which took place on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Ar@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York to find out how to move to armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you look back from behind , then you should turn off right , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go off from the line of the line , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says .
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow in your face .
then strike him with the knee to the l@@ ath and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers fall off pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward , while they judge the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers coming from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the Line of Fire , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , take the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backward and place the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi premi@@ er .
but remember that there is a prey to the saf@@ est , your money will be over - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the most polluted places in Europe
a British Reis@@ er under@@ took his immune system and wor@@ de@@ fle@@ xed to a serious test - taking some of the clean@@ est and poor places of Europe .
the present@@ er and guide Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk de@@ posed his train to a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toil@@ ette as well as a public telephone in Russia to make resistance to its immune system .
before the de@@ cks of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show yourself and show us what he will get in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; presented some surprising results of daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toil@@ ette which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely out@@ rep@@ elling , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with physicians and medical professionals talked about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he ab@@ dic@@ ated , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his gut when he travelled through the world and ate some strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to railway stations up to dish@@ washing places of toilets , the task proved its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concern and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film , he was just right for his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ ance number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the sheets of fresh hands were less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to be emp@@ tied after their L@@ umin@@ um@@ ometer then ranged over 4000 units while fresh @-@ washed hands have a less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I smo@@ ked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is here inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer users something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to look and at the same time explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ic .
we brought Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which it ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in col@@ on health is a global phenomenon ,
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a major context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal Health is a global phenomenon , and with the film , we were able to provide the consumption of consumers for more information on an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of things I have instructed to do so as the ek@@ y Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to create them , and to others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy delic@@ ac@@ ies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents in particular associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they do not include at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed by Del@@ og@@ ation Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ z , Corn@@ wall
a Dutch family left their social flat after a delay with a damage of £ 50,000 , because they are terror@@ ised their neighbours .
T@@ any@@ a Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock was thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ z , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly taken out of their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls are engraved on , wood panels were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor . gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been moved and it is believed to be in a private accommodation now .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the home management at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer necessary .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the opinion that people do not need to live in this way .
there are many things to be considered , since this property is thought to be considered not as a beautiful part of the Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , who meanwhile lived in the home and the police said that the terror , which had added the family , street fighters with bas@@ eb@@ bles , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , drug traffi@@ cking , drugs and floods .
skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an order for ant@@ iso@@ zi@@ al behavior in June .
in some areas of the house , which will be demolished under the circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found .
in the property , in which drugs are tra@@ ded on drugs , the wooden houses were torn up .
neighbours said they had to fight on the road and to act regularly , the police had to be called .
Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing del@@ og@@ ried her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , saying that their life was made to hell .
one said from : &quot; they did not dare anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not always !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ ol@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that it would have been the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long .
both gar@@ bage and old toys were cast down on the exposed side of the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the rent@@ ers meet for their behaviour and that of their family , since a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider the Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , since the behavior was extremely aw@@ ful and their deeds were terrible to watch for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church we have agreed upon us and have given us the information we have done .
I hope that this development will donate some neighbours of comfort and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ zi@@ al behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were living at different times in the house , but they are all over 20 .
a dirty one , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house following the del@@ og@@ ation of the house .
workers of the house administration are to be able to open gar@@ bage mountains , surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis and commodity , par@@ ap@@ hi@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
skel@@ don received a fine , after the possession of a drug in class B , a fine of fine recognition .
she claimed that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who was killed in 2013 by car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ any@@ a and her partner are now living in a private accommodation at Pl@@ ymouth .
many rooms of the house were rewarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will blow rent@@ ers , which do not keep in the order of the house
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , with that the Del@@ og@@ ation affir@@ med a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not keep in order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can be be@@ at@@ ched without self @-@ accus@@ ation as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate any criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone at the plate alone , between sentences and time outs , they had no co@@ aches .

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans are pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states , to be in their majority .
his election campaign Donald Tr@@ ump gave now the weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the former Republi@@ can high castle Utah .
a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ track and self @-@ safe M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire gets something like you expressed , correspon@@ ded as correspon@@ dents .
after he cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success will rise in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame the false reports on his candid@@ ature , he took up his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can Plateau
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or , that of June , reported Tr@@ ump and his conc@@ essi@@ onist of the Demo@@ cr@@ at , Hill@@ ary Clinton in 2013 .
other institutes are seen forward , but not by the gap that is custom@@ ary for Republi@@ can candidates in the state of the state .
at risk , Arizona and Georgia are at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview from the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how to restore the turn of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he can &apos;t do anything else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it wasn &apos;t enough for him because of the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , said Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is said to cut funds for the support of his election campaign , it should be present no better circulation .
instead of what if one wanted to get the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress migh@@ tier than the poor .
Olympia : three best sc@@ am with d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplines of the disciplines .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second D@@ oping sc@@ andal at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after an initial attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to his home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to establish a disciplinary committee of the disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function was informed that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ est Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team leadership of Kenya has been reported by the d@@ oping controllers .
the IOC &apos;s international association IA@@ AF has been looking for information on the case to strict about its own research , the IA@@ AF spokes@@ person shared a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( C@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and spent itself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan CEO de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was the ac@@ creditation of the athletes who stood on the list for training checks of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in Peking to become more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics deleg@@ ate was sub@@ tra@@ cted by the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed against cash payments from his country on high d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he reportedly was arrested at the return of Nairobi at his return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya has been at the IOC after numerous D@@ oping publishers as a longer time for a longer period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the announcement of more than 2000 d@@ oping target checks before the Rio Olympics , it is unusual that athletes from Kenya and Russia were put into sight .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a consequence , the W@@ A@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose d@@ oping com@@ bating con@@ forms to the rules of W@@ A@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of TV reports , ARD will always be charged with evidence that in Kenya D@@ oping @-@ funds will be easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC member , Richard P@@ ound , finally requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he was in the Russian Field Ath@@ le@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport , covering and systematically lo@@ oped .
Russia &apos;s athletes have been expelled from the summer playing .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable love story , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a surprising C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical captured Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classic temple and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra pit under the direction of Venezuel@@ an Australian Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; is heated .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she remembers her lovers , with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally unusual !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be there .
she says in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also n@@ ai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise to the opera singer : &quot; C@@ eci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an innocent person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and a very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you can see it in every of his movements , in his bli@@ cks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share these musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , passion , and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American Director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece , things are about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ists went to New York , and didn &apos;t want to see the New York population .
they are the same topics , and they are as po@@ ison@@ ous today as it was at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

the Tre@@ ats magazine is working together with the photographer David Bel@@ lem@@ ere , to publish a 1970s Pi@@ relli inspir@@ ational calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous n@@ ud@@ dly people they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us in the beginning of this year that his N@@ ailing magazine of classic school @-@ boys distingu@@ ishes itself as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I &apos;m doing that for women .
apparently he is the mind that it does not give calendar to calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classic troubles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which women feel comfortable and feeling of these images of a female body , Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women are going to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts with Mass Cur@@ sed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit for himself and Erd@@ og@@ an pra@@ ises , sits on animated suit@@ cases , &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len Foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short term , the Kurdish commune of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers coming from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , even &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard har@@ dening of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass s@@ cur@@ sion to Germany .
&quot; in short term , with tens of thousands , medium term , with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already passed the months ahead of Kurdish high bur@@ dens with pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the run .
after the f@@ eit@@ ed coup , there are still se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks .
many will start to start in Europe when they are re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that self @-@ refugees , in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff was the targeted settlement of sy@@ r@@ ischer &apos;s Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ ite cities .
with that , Erd@@ og@@ an increase the withdrawal request to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ min@@ ated in the past hundred years or expelled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of Staff ordered that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition groups .
the fire market as a quality tra@@ ilers have been destroyed by teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit for himself and Erd@@ og@@ an pra@@ ises , sits on animated suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ p and se@@ cular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported the newspaper on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum in Germany due to political persecution in Germany .
on June 30 , this would have been 11.@@ 386 people , and therefore almost 29 percent of all as@@ yl@@ ates have been recognized as as@@ yl@@ as ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , it is not referring to the war , poverty or the most significance .
asylum seek@@ ers under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state of government , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where to hurt ... &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals comes nothing from the summer @-@ campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ships from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote in the country &apos;s day .
they have understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the country code will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the German parliament had already decided at the beginning of the year .
because the day so far it does not go : summer vacation , heat and land sw@@ amp@@ ons - that should be enclosed .
the locals , who are to be convinced of the campaign events are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang up the posters , air ballo@@ ons bub@@ bles , spread flyer and count towards the end of the vote .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and last days of this day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass a campaign for just under the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it also concerns something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strong Neul@@ ing Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his big posters .
he travels across the countryside , disper@@ se ro@@ ses and pl@@ ums a little with the people , as it did also his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , se@@ ering cold feet have received and gives the Chancellor Merkel the blame to the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spe@@ eding up the ascent of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now cost the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its peak candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place campaign .
she has invited two German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel was in the North East .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it is too bad to anyone else to listen to other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual turn@@ outs on market positions and pre @-@ shopping m@@ alls with sun umbre@@ l@@ las and air ballo@@ ons .
in this way , Kok@@ o says , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union , too , has noted that , in the country the base is crum@@ bling , that it must be very severe , to find a wire to the people again .
you are on the left hand , the SPD , the Green : in the times of the country there is hardly any thing .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U campaign against his Mit@@ stre@@ ite is also self @-@ discharged : &quot; they must go there where people are doing , namely where people are : h@@ ottest , Golden wedding , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD now to a very dedicated campaign campaign .
in pol@@ ls the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD gained a clear view with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , Small Party , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , is expected to go into the country &apos;s day .
you are going to make a modern virtu@@ oso from the holiday of emergency and spend their campaign in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the Pre@@ sidents of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green electoral campaign on track c@@ ens@@ ors go to local ab@@ uses among the resorts .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the peak channel dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat by the Mecklenburg @-@ Lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; voting holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : gas facilities suffer from locking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only at around 20 o &apos;clock , there is al@@ ab@@ al@@ ment praise .
&quot; these were all fairly delicate , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a superb team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south on the weekend as scheduled , by the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will also be able to charge the work responsible for the construction work , for example if it comes to facility treatment drives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday to the south , the blocking of the A@@ sper@@ g@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ on@@ burg has also been relaxed .
citizens can now go on both sides from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the embar@@ go through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were sometimes significant complaints , &quot; says the head of the per@@ verse management of the rehabilitation responsible for the rehabilitation management of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many of them sought after and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i as the signs .
what has led to a lack of trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality will intensi@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable claims , &quot; says King who had experienced himself on site about the location .
two to three per minute have been blocked .
the fastest one was on the hour @-@ 30 zone at 77 hours per hour .
but since the construction site has gone on , it has become more quiet .
for the business professionals at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ on@@ burg the street is now open again .
in the cards you don &apos;t want to watch business professionals .
however , that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has resulted in revenues for a bro@@ ther@@ ly bro@@ ther@@ ly bro@@ il , lets everyone to look through .
however , some more and some have been affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; End@@ less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means for other companies , the renovation has barely consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but this also shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mileage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the strongest are the local spots on the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only it but all the hosts have made it hard . &quot;
it l@@ acked the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen , and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro .
the sales volumes are based on &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
road maps have rec@@ eded his farm &quot; at two years . &quot;
he has to let the half of his staff must be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would react differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication that the restaurant has benef@@ ited from the benefits of the situation at the B . now they must also have the dis@@ advantages taken by the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner white from other coun@@ ties , where more gener@@ ously handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass on .
finally , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other regular passengers are now able to do less frequently due to the complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also different .
his tri@@ bun@@ ny returned to the end of the re@@ organisation at the end of the re@@ organisation , however , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
constantly in the name of the terror control on laws were screw@@ ed together .
according to the latest proposals , the Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère takes now a thick security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of these ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ ner .
all of his suggestions were &quot; politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security shar@@ ks .
they do not require anyone seeking anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also am contributing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the interior minister , it is located on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to recent attacks in Würzburg , Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère won a little time , before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals , which has not been made to the SPD so far : he wants to show sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups in punishment and negoti@@ ate jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man .
however , it is acceptable for reasonable and demanding nothing , as the body partner has no chances anyway .
a few new ideas present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will also present .
some of these are in part : it plans rapid @-@ test procedures for shifts and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people prior to deportation .
refugees that are targeted to the country , are to open their smartphone in advance , and open social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ les for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - about those who commit offen@@ ders or reject their papers to suffer their identity .
some of them is politically and legally delicate .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and is open to questions .
and with some points - in the im@@ aging of amp@@ oules , for example - asks the question : what does that mean to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the ass@@ ass@@ in came from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
many people in view of the high refugee numbers are worried about security .
and things , those who are deeply moved , let not be cl@@ assed in constitu@@ ent times even in electoral times .
the internal security is enormous in focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ certainty is big .
and yes , there are electoral strug@@ gles .
Union and SPD sees the topic of internal security therefore increasingly in position .
in recent days it passed between the two parties .
only a gar@@ dener about the equipment of the federal police , then concerning a security policy collection of some of the Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the departments are also asking a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère takes care of too ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able tones here .
from a return of a double pass he does not stop anything .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they are new to make , be not meaning@@ ful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he did not have any un@@ constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional , and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot to rest , which could make war .
however , the SPD also tries to agree on the theme of internal security .
party leaders Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals first discussion of discussion and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
yet another Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ed through .
despite the diesel models , the pay@@ outs are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running round .
there are vor@@ tex around a term in the recall reaction .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest car bus can continue to increase its increase in the previous year .
but in July , the brand @-@ brand VW weak@@ ens the total sales of VW in Western Europe and thus re@@ charged the total sales as it was in the da@@ x not@@ ched company .
worldwide VW in July , with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below last year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries are almost one sixth of the sixth .
market sales of Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , I have given a purchase order in some core markets . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote in Turkey also imp@@ acted out of the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the United States , where the exhaust emissions are first escal@@ ated , a Min@@ us will continue to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to gli@@ mp@@ ed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a premium volume of 0.9 % was to be sold to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
net sales of Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July was able to hold a further increase in sales from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated using a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls for some 2.5 million cars to convert to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after dis@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus service gives the customer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but didn &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a matter of legal actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen best@@ ows its German customer now a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Commerce in the past Monday , VW .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has finished the regulations of my order for the order and the KBA assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; said federal law Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after re@@ armament and have unchanged all the relevant relevant vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself is using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how to name it in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; Volkswagen now sees the possibility that customers would come to a workshop for six months after the upgrade to a workshop , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also , in the customer interests it is important to avoid any other damages , which do not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal , regarding any warranty conditions such as it was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW do not use the concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is demanded at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see from wealthy au@@ sterity - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank Chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 people to park the € 40 million on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks talks about an individual case and does not see signal : normal spar@@ ks would not have to pay for their savings penalty . &quot;
- Ban@@ ks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund since September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ski@@ pped 40 million Euros that could be withdrawn from one day on the other and that he could not be able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank account with me at the central bank account and account for 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ rupt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost he will give after the caus@@ eless principle now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is simply going to be in the saf@@ t@@ res of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank too , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers had their understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only a few moves to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course caused considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry you alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account transfer , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for inser@@ ts from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay off deposits for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany is too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one ban@@ ker said , at the valley of T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff which is equipped with a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bench G@@ mund has two offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks that calculate an anne@@ x for inser@@ ts of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Ban@@ ks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich announced in late June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negatives compared to the private client , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in width .
destination : who purchases sound boards ?
lon@@ ely men love plat@@ ens .
before you go to the comment section to over@@ sow@@ ing him under the p@@ seud@@ onym N@@ all@@ ele of men &apos;s economic age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the emergence of records of records didn &apos;t want to see a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which would like to welcome the re@@ dness of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ No@@ stal@@ gic .
those who have bought a record recently are of all Q4 between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older board sellers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest gray starter and wild before I stand , my hands hold and something difference : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw away a loser . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly over to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers have been resident - there &apos;s a handful of fantastic distributors .
I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part , in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data quantity : eight men mean age , one woman probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; he says , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not have followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now capable of buying plates that he could not afford to buy and sold items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ t .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I think was something to be young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is right for those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend your time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my master .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback . let &apos;s see how to buy their old records .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually took to their collection as a rule in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ on@@ ica , in order to know that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ in@@ ers .
according to We@@ z some of the older customers ass@@ ump@@ tions to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some disk fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stur@@ d@@ ful sound samples from the objects that are happy to watch the lucky jewel@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material owner than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like your social worker ! &quot; fl@@ ashed a staff from a flat stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record for the last month have not yet heard .
the survey found that 41 % have a record player that they never use it , while 7 % of those that buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I pass through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Scot@@ ia .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men , middle age ) works , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phi@@ al aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ car@@ nival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man recently came down here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I own no record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ al record board so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ ens@@ la@@ ve .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are the younger people , not older ones who are slowly coming slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and Women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , wild beasts of the latest Syn@@ thes@@ ia and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz is used in the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such po@@ vers@@ ität in our customers .
none of them looks especially lon@@ ely but brand @-@ psychological trau@@ mas are hard to realize if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the panels available for sale .
it rather makes a sh@@ rou@@ gh@@ ter than a big one .
it does not deser@@ ve a lot , therefore the collecting of sheets is not real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loved sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a business , of which it is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am introducing the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenage girls who group@@ ed for a moment about Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cro@@ sley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees her - perhaps because they are just pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to handle them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers can send in the depths of So@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even the one that gives most of luxury objects such as records .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least into record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and plate lovers , that exist in reality , record shops and online resources , un@@ taken into account .
these people are presumably working hard in school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security by record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while she prot@@ ru@@ des an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator that rises above the shoulders of nothing suffering of middle ages .

French dish re@@ jects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a selection of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities argued that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary business in those persons within the camp of Goo@@ ds , selling cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ z , sell hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy , of which they would not be paid for taxes and have a fire and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , because the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .

how much money is going to take over the take@@ over , Microsoft shared not on Thursday .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has more than 100,000 users .
they can look at others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give the players missions and face enemies and provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany R@@ aser must adjust to the next generation of velocity measurements : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are advis@@ able even effectively effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on auto@@ bahn Construction sites or to san@@ itation bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit@@ er to comply with the speed limit .
a durable mobile device can , however , can be dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery lasts five days of un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days , the case data is encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit , as well as the drive @-@ down to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driven state you can move the trailer with any car with a trailer hook .
so that it is not easy to use , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels will van@@ ish in the arm@@ oured , and by the way , un@@ lock out outer outer walls .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the bl@@ itz from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is being tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and has now also been used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Great Britain takes silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji bring into gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt end at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ dic@@ tive stage in Rio de Janeiro .
Fiji shared a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , im@@ press line , line of lines and ro@@ wers to win Gold - her first Olympic ame@@ play in any colour .
the defeat was disp@@ osed of the silver medal in the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth in that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but , regardless of this , the Fiji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in its form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Bri@@ t morning will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap is hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began to be wonderful and ordered the GB@@ S attacks from Sp@@ ass .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. and when you walk in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au passed over in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner , which he turned in .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly used the ball .
a h@@ ass@@ able bapt@@ ist of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann @-@ Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a saw a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since re @-@ launch and there was still a minute game play ... in the first half .
V@@ la@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ fers through a further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ my to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , when the Fiji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still existed .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap .... for a whole of four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a Br@@ illi@@ ant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Norton launched a study for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the southern se@@ avi@@ an , whose fans sang and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to see the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame wag@@ ered the i bag cap with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle hit , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and was crushed into the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fiji Japan defeated in the half @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pushed South Africa into a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ cks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate below the post in the second half .
a brilliant end tac@@ it of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ th team , secured the prize - and thus the silver Medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning is inspired by fighting with the cancer of the train@@ ers
there will be no more bi@@ ke@@ en Gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard h@@ uts which go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the coach Robin Williams , was there as she was for the second international Olympic champion in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter inde@@ xed use , which is also exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , which slip over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ nesses , which does not reflect the type of the Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in the ru@@ ction , a Bat@@ a@@ illon is willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which make up the difference and there was no one more helpful as a trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he might be treatment early 2014 , out of season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption was to a minimum , in case that is the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was at the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ge in the morning to speak a little more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Artil@@ lery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a little , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repeated how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks is sent to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person for a train@@ ee or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the past 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were to be opened , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to ri@@ p yourself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make some Tol@@ ler .
we didn &apos;t want to get a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
for next week , Glo@@ ver will appear on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an international Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years exemplary for clarity :
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ re from retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the large water producer .
it was the case some time ago in the original version of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia revealed a little later .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ es &apos; sailed &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this there is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the team &apos;s purpose , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now in retirement at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality broad@@ brunn , promotes some 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the church of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water supply agreements for other cities and communities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the purpose since 1988 .
&quot; his duties are very versatile , and they range from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , the budget adjustment , lim@@ ulation of fees and contributions to emergency response at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the rehabilitation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and I always added new features , because water means water means drinking water and water the most important food .
in her speech , she blessed G@@ öl@@ le &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has been involved with a lot of heart bl@@ ut for its water purpose and he has been living right for the water purpose , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ a group based on nit@@ rate reduction in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia River forum .
he has received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s hand praised the water@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best water stallion and he was a faithful place .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as the highlights from his point of view , he called the well @-@ construction and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
but the greatest challenge and the most difficult operation were the tube break at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ ner on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees we had to work through the whole night so the towns could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because you filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with blu@@ ish boxes .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose was transferred to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who will follow the follow@@ er of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko goes openly with the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and addressed to other people concerned : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called for us and declared to be shot dead in his lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator was on the run , after him will be publicly tra@@ ced .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown , and has a glass .
meanwhile , the police released a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon , as the police force .
he who sees Sven will call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victims was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck sought to make any data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently say no more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o was charged ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost in millions of dollars .
financial burden , which threatened to be threatened by the industry , are of the table .
it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy revolution in the conservation area for the so @-@ called pec@@ uli@@ ar production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspap@@ er &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy about it that we finally could reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use the steel producer , which emit flamm@@ able gases from the high @-@ furnace generation process for your own consumption .
according to the German industry associations , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , it now has a fundamental settlement of the EU Commission after convers@@ ations with competitive dis@@ miss@@ als Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the altern@@ ators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent does not fall .
but also this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission to qualify for their own production .
the status Quo will largely be fixed to the previous regulation .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emissions of miti@@ gation are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann stated in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been covered by excess of over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy the world &apos;s biggest producers in China , owing to the weak@@ ening domestic demand of lumin@@ ous steel on the global market .
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts at price d@@ umping .
during this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
to the one show in@@ fusion oil on impor@@ ter effect , for others the economic outlook in China have emerged .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was careful in Thursday .
most recently the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts on the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted not to exclu@@ de cl@@ auses of individual plants .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association said on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been reduced by two percent below last year &apos;s level .
the association expects to rise in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
fellowship , spirit , health : sing sen@@ tim@@ ents good
her singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp : as young girls she was in Schul@@ ch@@ or , the school teacher , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a senior choir .
&quot; they are moving - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal it feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit .
for singing is like for several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Seni@@ ors League .
most seniors singing in chor@@ us and share with equ@@ alled the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular assem@@ bling , seniors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often there are social and family structures in the age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk and organise themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special shape of being &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , think H@@ ac@@ kler .
because you are practi@@ cing a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls his lungs regularly , doesn &apos;t make it fast in everyday life so fast from the pu@@ rest .
even though it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for elderly people , Singen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Ministry of Senior Citi@@ zens .
in older generations , the joint singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and free time , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people often awak@@ ens many memories , often combined with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and especially melodies , people are sin@@ cer@@ tained to the disease in a long re@@ lying events .
in addition , the head is asked for a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time to focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you de@@ parts through the singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a terri@@ fic praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in choir .
to show yourself : if I feel long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over myself - this experience is strengthening .
good reasons to begin with singing , there is enough .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he goes to have little talent , av@@ enger L@@ enz .
is it not singing alone - with 50 sin@@ c@@ ous people , who hears , when a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if anyone is singing in an acquaint@@ ance with a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , then you can simply connect .
many cities also provide views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the Church leader .
many retirement par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma can also be found on the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the Internet .
anyone who desire to sing is advised to join a choir , av@@ eng@@ ed H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to each age .
cats react sensitive than cal@@ dera of the kittens of the kittens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect has the impact of cat &apos;s bab@@ es to adult animals .
it was not too bad for its surprise . however , the male had not cold , however , they were always equal to the females always .
female cats may recognize the path@@ ogen of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on the mi@@ xes of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens which are found in great distress such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
however , people also react to the ru@@ ten of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ xes of less and heavily damaged young for the males either are not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is the first part of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the bi@@ b @-@ cry with the gravity of their help is different .
a total of nine adult male and eight babies from the livestock of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a ru@@ ten of little ones , which were taken up for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger er@@ ous kittens , which were elevated in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who have not their own offspring , responded to the cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this rowing was played very much shorter kittens .
this ability may possibly be an@@ born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the male responded at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
some studies showed that women will become sensitive to babies , although they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ da Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann had already reported .

already in July , after the withdrawal of the receipt of the insurrection , the government , the daily life of normal citizens should not be imp@@ aired .
this , however , does not apply to those who are suspected of taking the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which you are responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not used before the football .
the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ ti@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
therefore , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group living in America in the Americas .
Sü@@ me@@ i shall be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
true , the first state of the last 90 days is still valid until October , actually the life of the most Turks still has no effect on the life of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public squares in the whole country has finished Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the land - split in tra@@ ilers and opponents of the earth .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are not counting the friends of the President .
but the Turks , however , united in the history of dramatic experience in the history of the Turks , is the stri@@ k@@ ted ref@@ usal of military put@@ sch .
there even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats in Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
with Cup winner of the Gala , it will be delighted to arrive to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporty value set the Cologne in the past season and proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first play as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for record meister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Pre @-@ Round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; is also early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g there was only one to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trophy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 show hits as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que put the base to the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in this case , the AC Florence signed an agreement with AC Florence under the contract and announced at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as just after the coup attempt to return to the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he must just tell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the storms would be willing to wai@@ ve some one @-@ third of its yearly harvest of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals of medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was already locked twice to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ li@@ fel@@ ess Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
other surviving Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
d@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in front of the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping se@@ per@@ y shortly before the games was cancelled at their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ ess and hat@@ ches .
a hur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie was offered : with a set of smile she was proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
as a fixed one , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a che@@ eks .
but there are still numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start of the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past to the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the field of athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
ever since he has been running the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month Sper@@ re after taking the in@@ gest@@ ion of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation strong tooth pain , she defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Champion was tested on the banned stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic suffered from the initial in@@ gest@@ ion and was closed six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m was tested in 2010 and has been closed 21 months .
a mean to penis enlargement may be responsible , deceived Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes have been recognized as many medals afterwards .
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 , nine years later , after it was determined with testosterone d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to show Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ oping and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games he was given back to a charter of the International Sport@@ Court of Justice C@@ AS .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and golden favor@@ it@@ in was only tested in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , notes on the in@@ gest@@ ive dietary supplement was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ A@@ DA was mild and ran as early as July 13th .
bom@@ b@@ ital error in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Mehr@@ ere dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand get up with the woman in touch , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was tortured and treated in the hospital , but I have already left the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has planned for her home journey at the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also are affected , is still un@@ clear .
the State Department stand up in a permanent contact with local authorities , so bar@@ b@@ ish .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , situated around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a go@@ thic two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early in the morning , two war@@ ri@@ ms went on high , and according to the authorities a further human being was killed .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
at the det@@ onation in the proximity of the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban staff .
according to the authorities , the bomb explo@@ ded in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police into the air .
finally , still det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the southwest coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
one was leaving from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , and named it .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army chamber of Dan@@ ai , meth@@ av@@ ee early Friday early in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ ions - but it is likely to do it by the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
by contrast , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ person in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
in recent days , the authorities have kept confi@@ dential information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks corner .
the police demonstrated its officials throughout the country to enhance security about important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are some small bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands König B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of reason , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
according to the disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this dream which grants the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said the bombs are an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power after a phase of bloody violence in 2014 , keeps himself too good to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it is not successful to the military that in the utter@@ most parts of the country in the extreme south from the country to get hold of the insur@@ gent insur@@ gent insur@@ g@@ ents .
more than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , there were 20 people killed in Bangkok with an attack in killing 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; has led to the Vis@@ ier of the Federal Office of constitutional protection .
after several provincial offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the league have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; we see the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; points for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of the democratic principle , &quot; said the German Press Agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , the immigrants , or from the Middle East , are diff@@ ra@@ zed in an extreme way .
therefore we observe the movement too .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots which has also been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; Un@@ controlled Mass Immig@@ ration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of his own identity . &quot;
constitutional protective in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thüringen - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ e@@ ate said , his authority has been part@@ n@@ ered by the decision in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; try to remove their target group , where she is standing , &quot; said the ruling boss .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to arrange them with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ ose music .
the daily Islam@@ ists are as well as the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a praying advertising for its own cause .
propaganda is supposed to be emotional to people .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the end there had been reports from several federal states reports about contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he didn &apos;t know any results .
for the constitutional protection of this type , the possible contacts of this type are only relevant for a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist to change their destination and thus extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , whether such people have a control influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the clear increase of righ@@ ted pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new terrorism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that it can cause illegal political structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that further legal fac@@ tions or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee seek@@ ers or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs .
it is not recogni@@ zable in Germany or the long @-@ term control of right @-@ cat@@ ch@@ ism .
the groups emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
worried anymore , so did not ate that many gri@@ ps appeared on the account of people who had not entered the German scene before .
this is wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ect attacks on asylum in asylum were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders , or supporters of the right @-@ scene .
&quot; many people have committed offen@@ ders previously by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left @-@ left , which may be radi@@ c@@ alised by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ stic mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer visible in TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social media , Hab@@ te was then used to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a response of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather its not just sporting figure that moved attention to the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming @-@ federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in different countries well @-@ known .
since there are most sport@@ s@@ men in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the lap .
some media drawn him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made him funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i enjoyed attention for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ ator@@ ial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meter fre@@ estyle .
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim for eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the contest .

dr@@ ump sees the dro@@ oping down situation not as tight
the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on a turn@@ able event in Florida .
should it be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then drive into the holiday .
lost Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential election in November , it would be either folding , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV channel CN@@ BC .
if it wasn &apos;t enough for him because of the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
thus , he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate in the Demo@@ cr@@ at , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed .

soon , the Group wants to start trading with the v@@ ans .
the Post wants to offer its electric v@@ ans from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on to third parties &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ FK leadership occurs after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K moves his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
but the returned times came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K decided that the chair of Staff Matthias Hart@@ mann is the more difficult to stay longer the promised successes .
Tur@@ bul@@ ls at the head of the Nürn@@ berger Market Research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the resignation of the company &apos;s management is the global number five in the branch ahead of a person@@ alised new beginning .
G@@ FK &apos;s Chief Executive Officer aims to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K @-@ Supervisory Board Ar@@ no resulted from the Supervisory Board of Directors with effect from 12 September .
as early as 1 September , the management board will take over the board of the board of Gerhard Ad@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , the company was divided into the management board .
he is supposed to take over the position of a &quot; Executive Board , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found .
as a reason for the back@@ rest , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to non @-@ term business alignment .
details wanted to call an corporate spokesman on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be involved in future research companies , is currently un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , at the end of the shareholders , there was a big dis@@ appointment on Friday at the shareholders &quot; Action over the further expanding successes of the years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet visible even after 5 years . &quot;
in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business , each share of the shareholders will eventually be un@@ steady .
&quot; if it were in the case for BMW , the Qu@@ and@@ ts would do so , &quot; he named it .
following attacks in the previous quarters of 2016 , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales generated with 72@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter above all bur@@ dened the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company , which is necessary in the Consumer Experience , requires 139 million euros in the Group under the stem a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
during the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
cr@@ ashes - bus non@@ slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in tren@@ ches : eight wounded
an accident of 43 senior citizens were killed as passengers in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( District Aur@@ I ) and eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their details according to an opposing L@@ aster that drove partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a tren@@ ch as a spokes@@ person for the police Aur@@ I / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an ambul@@ ances came to the accident on state road 2 .
the final trav@@ ellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ül@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum back by a regular service bus .
there they should wait for a spare bus of travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load of load and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees for each cubic metre of waste water will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ il@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will then be increased again , if appropriate measures are necessary .
after a sleep@@ est lime en@@ cro@@ w , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was determined by the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat , Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that these se@@ wage systems have been over@@ hau@@ led .
the case of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to maintain the facilities for the basis of legal foundation .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ il@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to follow deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
like managing director Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new kal@@ k@@ ulation of the fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess and non @-@ discover@@ ies from the previous year period are to be equ@@ alled .
Schmidt founded the gra@@ zing fee increases and Schmidt thus established that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage systems with a very low se@@ wage that is located between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution base , for example , expenditure required for repairs of several thousand euros would be gra@@ ded .
furthermore , the se@@ wage treatment in all three plants should be slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ eding calendar period , all three plants were not least due to their age of re@@ organisation and repair charges in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world nations , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by mechanical ventilation system based on a claim .
in the pump@@ ing world , the nearly 20 @-@ year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken from the ground and the first climbing di@@ ke had to be fitted out , the Kl@@ är@@ lu@@ dge run and an additional ventilation option had to be fitted in order to keep the waterproof regulations in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the continued support and maintenance costs incurred in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 was still clearly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses clearly indicates that the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be fully hit in the three turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , Schmidt instit@@ uted the market for large entertainment costs in the waste water plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ valent after view of stone houses on a period of time , especially since the supply zone of the Ab@@ se@@ wage Federation Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be enlarged by these facilities , because it is a deficit of these facilities .
Bulgaria ver@@ sible for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when recorded positive 0.2 % .
the annual average income of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in demand for consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; Transportation and Culture ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and Hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices for clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel to races .
with its filter tool , it allows you to change about 150 million daily users to alter the reality and play with ident@@ ities as such a way that already borders the sur@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform themselves into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ oss@@ om , independent @-@ cre@@ amy tools that generates more than 30 million sel@@ ytes per day .
all mis@@ guided tours get to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past critic@@ isms that they were accused of prop@@ ag@@ ing the app Black@@ face @-@ dere or white skin as a beauti@@ fy deal .
when this week proposed some U@@ sers a Filter which gave them sli@@ pped , false teeth and recorded che@@ eks , there were some critics called a ra@@ cially car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ atic - &quot; yel@@ low@@ out . &quot;
they asked whether this repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y has prevented a larger problem , that the company has with di@@ vers@@ ität .
the news and indignation were spread out on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would be disabled .
the company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and did not think as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ atic areas .
but out@@ si@@ bles , the rac@@ ism have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter of inf@@ rin@@ gement cler@@ ks .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison list .
in an e @-@ mail Grace as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et were spread far beyond the photos so that the filter &quot; inf@@ rin@@ gement and gel@@ in@@ de was said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult to argue with the return position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish has moved to the extreme extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses that cultural productivity .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ atility and integration struggle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in terms of race other than their older opponent players - could expect to expect to expect sensiti@@ veness .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult to stay when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineering for medium , decided to delete the snap@@ shot account , and to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a telephone interview they said they believe that the road @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of di@@ vers@@ ität in the adju@@ sting of the chat icon .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and finished their use with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin shades , so that they can make such decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they are people with other skin colours that are working there , but not in positions , in which they feel safe or feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the snap@@ chat most un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers of di@@ vers@@ ität in its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , the chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible , which focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will be closed her snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership l@@ ush@@ es IS@@ IS intelligence information , introducing the congress of the Congress
according to the United States Central Command @-@ Command @-@ Command @-@ Command information change in order to mark an optimi@@ stic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , a committee of the Congress was reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Services Committee , declares by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Agen@@ cies that reported their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message services , which were char@@ itable typically by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander , were regularly toler@@ ated by the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as an analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article about the report .
&quot; what happened in Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , established .
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com will range up to the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct evidence to modify the reports under Obama , it shows how analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exposed to pressure from their fore@@ laws , an optimi@@ stic image from the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or Isi@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , a lot of Central Command news releases , comments and statements against the Congress clearly positive as it corresponds to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was admitted publicly that a military return of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in an opinion .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command set out the reviews of the Central Command in order to run the threat by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in the Life after them was admitted to worry about the mani@@ pulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress through the general meeting of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the news service committee published on Thursday their own insights , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled a excessive limited process for creating temporary employment estimates , &quot; the highest ranking Demo@@ cr@@ at in the Kom@@ m@@ ee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. ship , announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of foreign intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in respect of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who were recorded by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press conference of the Pentagon , issued a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not be able to comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigation into the general inspec@@ torate is still ongoing .
but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes might have di@@ verg@@ ent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations had the impact on the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year did not claim the question , as President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest in@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
criticism against the Islamic State remind us of dis@@ rup@@ tions about the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , opposed the recommendations of many analysts to do only a small occupying troops in Iraq and caused little time to deal with the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ kers also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ kers , according to government issues , asser@@ ted that , contrary to the statements of the government , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legislative Council for his excessive positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went on retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also won the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday to India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be memorable power , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who retain their doors in memory .
it knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal to their group with the British in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan will remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last round of the first lap on Saturday .
both teams have qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will take place on the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed team will take a little longer out of the way , leading to the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , Americans have triggered by its success story a surprising whirl@@ wind , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the past London Games .
B@@ am was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 , she became the National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was born , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the working group in London which we now have .
we enjoyed the ru@@ d@@ der to ri@@ p completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the s@@ uture area .
India was going to go to the game without victory at the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly ke@@ h and stopped the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with a flat ball about the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and put the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the por@@ ters of the United States , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to spend one gate in any of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but how good will be on Saturday from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ sof@@ ter at the Rio de Janeiro , a rapid relay between competition and pursu@@ it .
it is , when the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff , which is to be handed down from the w@@ rist@@ band to meet for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t log on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is on the occasion for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well be sent by these known names , established by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ watching TV advertising when it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , f@@ ights in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports , which are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ brushes shoot , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and let it reign over long .
but if I don &apos;t want to make arguments for my particular lovers , then let me direct the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline bed has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many people had asked that I didn &apos;t know it was an Olympic acceler@@ ator .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to contest , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and won a athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong Dong Region of China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend its gold medal in London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ dler has a certain outer view , partly because it sounds for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School as the one for the Olympic Games sounds .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a medi@@ um@@ er enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cardiovascular cit@@ ys of his never to end , but also the gra@@ z@@ ie des s@@ ne@@ ens and diving which combines two sports , which are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from Spain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline , &quot; which means a lot like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to hit a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before it ends up on the feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ x , you will be evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ member athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their quest to gold , faster , upwards and go over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , up and down at the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another caves : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the targeted pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to even touch one audience to tears .
but it &apos;s also that which I own while watching these games as something exhausted .
this trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ er@@ t , seem@@ ingly difficult as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes to the top , then down@@ wards , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no oil into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant re@@ vocation of time and gra@@ vit@@ ation .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and students of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming to 13.00 Eastern time ; the men &apos;s men start on Saturday , also around $ 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the level of consciousness can only be achieved by adju@@ sting and the object of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his air @-@ to @-@ air , new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , an alliance of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that funny protests have been killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just to inter@@ rupt it ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid group of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past few months , protests against the government shook the country and expanded into increasingly areas .
last week thousands of people killed on the streets and the fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ merciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot down and killed un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos from the protests that presumably were probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security personnel will strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights requires an incoming research now .
&quot; it was always difficult to unite this land and in future it will even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project director of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and secret services operate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a respec@@ table pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pi@@ vot@@ al train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued continuously the supp@@ ression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited to silence , but dis@@ sidents succeed to be silent .
many were sent into exile or sent into prison , or were killed in the arms of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ vern m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the dig@@ ging in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a vast election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this delicate , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced to forced the tur@@ mo@@ il of tur@@ mo@@ il in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of the bitter feeling after years of di@@ ink@@ age in front of the surface will now explo@@ de .
the first appears harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very many Ethiop@@ ians able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , so many people can still communicate via Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies where they are located .
several young Ethiop@@ ians showed that they were so many protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since A@@ pr@@ a prosp@@ ering the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Eth@@ op@@ ia , mainly Christian flood countries , in politics and economy , while they are exploited to O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat @-@ country @-@ areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ alist leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ evident disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ t@@ table gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly vulnerable to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special commissioned to edit opponents and to make them un@@ dam@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lack this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the south as Mr. Mel@@ es , which came from the northern region of northern Hungary .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result is more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had seen such a ri@@ ot was in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ ested , according to the data of analy@@ tics , they were apparently stolen by the government and then stolen .
during the next raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in recent months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ m@@ suit , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress at the poverty @-@ control .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protests in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media .
analy@@ tics say that the protest will bring the US and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ age flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to merge his ally in an already volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin horror hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained to its asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y to scatter his campaign by sending his repeated statement by President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton to be the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
the clari@@ fication of the clari@@ fication of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can candidates , on whether he should be able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings to his fel@@ low@@ ds that endeav@@ our@@ ing to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the actual position , which he could not be meant by at all .
after he had made the reference to a campaign events on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump withdrew regarding the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , Mr. Tr@@ ump said that he was just sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews , he meant the exc@@ use seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to let down the statement something weak@@ ening it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate would not know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ er@@ ted to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling circulation levels on economic conditions .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped speaking to the economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
he warned about Twitter being warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ us to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said , the Russians should make Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails h@@ acking , but he later declared &quot; Natural . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump allowed to shift the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , &quot; clari@@ fy &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication party that ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think too , he is cle@@ ver@@ ly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has always assumed an estimated tone , since its circulation has dropped further .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to exc@@ use for his pro@@ vocation , he accused his critics often to understand his statements or to be false to his hum@@ our .
but while he is strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps j@@ okes his loyal companion to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant to his own statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ cess@@ ors , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says is legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ grounds , completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ instream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government ran under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister , it allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw them off to ride on every one of his words and to be taken out against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television expert , trying to understand it and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats who have been killed about Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price down from the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sparkling café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue in front was displaced .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , which was replaced in the summer of 2014 , will be sold to Cup@@ cakes in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native indi@@ genes as the last loss in a city @-@ threatening town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ abs wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ ause is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee , the owner and manager of the new coffee maker .
he began working in 2001 near Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer was offered to provide money for a new foreign office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machinery model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are curtains like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ously onions .
there are natural de@@ cryp@@ t .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a constantly flood of old customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has recently been a customer on Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the verb regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
when the verb had closed , she gave a coff@@ e@@ et for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that was right in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered coffee at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee maker C@@ hai Tea , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing tradition since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered un@@ even the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a s@@ wiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes it changes his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t fight a p@@ etty about it that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie made a special soap for des@@ ks using the cold so@@ dden coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the men@@ ue to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez . Rodri@@ guez said that he introduced them to see them soon , so that his new neighbour feel welcome .
the site has also further advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is expanding into a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , he said that the subject of eating and ordering a new coffee was feeling like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension as President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt was a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ acy on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and then dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food @-@ historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ it last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Chinese cuisine in the USA , during Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the grocery perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron district , which has been in business since its IPO crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables .
when the reporter of Hack@@ ney ordered , this took place for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ uss@@ ers , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat , that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ind .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ iled for male rocks and it was served fresh past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans that sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the ways to which the country went on to be no longer the lar@@ s@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans was a centr@@ alized issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ z was just as sharp : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ts were to be stap@@ le food , the casserole , as &quot; wonderful type , food pois@@ oning , &quot; noticed Zi@@ egel@@ man because ba@@ it could hide un@@ disturbed ingredients under a liquid sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry tea .
meat , which was the center of the American kitchen for years , became an rarely ser@@ ved luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mixtures have been tried out , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutr@@ itious satisfaction was pre @-@ tried by taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks made a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the business recipes .
as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stanley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
in writing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become the &quot; budget policy , &quot; and the challenge , pro@@ p like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rot into delicious meals , to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical tre@@ ats .
especially tasty news reports are the answer of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm house of his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the one million@@ th man from the world , to which it became .
&quot; he liked the continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a smo@@ king .

President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ u@@ ose an Ex@@ alt on his stomach .
as described in the book , the union of an house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours are caused by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected when the country returned to the legs again .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as research on food was applied .
in writing of the book , the pair was better understood at the writing of bricks in mother in law - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear about the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man recalls : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind collapsed .
after the plates were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared , they pulled out a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um opus , ate the president Roosevelt at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a commonly trick that offers recipes a better name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no longer whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped a somewhat disp@@ leased a spoon into the f@@ ences , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad enough .
CO@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of bombs attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he made his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save another life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died with a bomb attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civilian person who saved the lives of almost 60,000 people in the newspaper so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers set their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their first help in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil society which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a child from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to lumin@@ ous symbol@@ ism in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when heroes has never seen himself , he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees within me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar had killed an attack on the attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters have dropped four fac@@ t@@ ins above the Alz@@ adia , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died .
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland is usually only in the winter to the surface .
this shark was allowed to hit the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna in the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and floating through the North Atlantic Ocean at a speed of 1 km / h .
Greenland was only getting up to 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland stop at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour he reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes on , it accelerates the five metre @-@ long animal on a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this matter of lon@@ el@@ iness was shining , but seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland expedition , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Mus@@ cle comments from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means to the verteb@@ rates a world record .
although the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist already suspected that Greenland is st@@ ony .
just l@@ acked the evidence .
Greenland is hard to observe , after all , they live especially in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they are water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the winter only in winter .
researchers recognize a little more about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their time @-@ bends are they , when they watched six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young ice @-@ bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ res that tor@@ ates from higher water layers beneath .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen held between 2010 and 2013 as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shark was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ res measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lenti@@ cular shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of oph@@ thalm@@ ologists is produced before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which , in it , are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a much carbon @-@ 14 carbon @-@ 14 in the lenti@@ cular core .
their birth was therefore supposed to be in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to hit large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 centimeters the length of the smallest animal , the lenti@@ cular anchor contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 due to the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his examination in 2012 .
in the contrast , all major Greenland h@@ uts had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centimet@@ re Greenland p showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimet@@ res rose even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females first get offspring when she is longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably due to the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y with the increase of at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be the world record of verteb@@ rates .
in particular , that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the old record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , put in his Sp@@ eck on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on au@@ sterity .
so they tyres even later - and al@@ op@@ ers slower .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are particularly large .
because the volume is growing much qui@@ cker than its surface , by which the animal feed heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; so , &quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous , and should focus on it as possible to have as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; says the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building of building in double pack
with issues around the building , the municipal council is concerned at the youngest meeting .
with relief , the Panel was adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , &quot; finally the marketing of the recently populated residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the property , par@@ cel@@ li@@ ation and exploration extensions could be clari@@ fied and placed the applications on sur@@ ve@@ ying , the sale of plots in the residential areas of &quot; road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is nothing more interested in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the b@@ umps in rural and quiet residential community beauty Schön@@ au young families and other senior citizens speak equally .
as it was said , Bau@@ r can immediately report immediately in the town hall , via the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els to be consul@@ ted in its September session .
in order to integrate further requests for the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , the municipal council decided to change its surface plan within the spring of this year only in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of sub@@ tim@@ ber@@ n , this area is already designated by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city at the Main is therefore the best chances to attract new jobs and companies in Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt is benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins , head of the compet@@ ency &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes continue to operate in London from financial transactions within the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the authorisation has now been granted to them in the UK .
that &apos;s just huge US banks .
several banks have already announced to mig@@ rate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be staged within five years at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , meeting the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance views , E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ut@@ ch@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg remains a great fund business , but also like Dublin as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not that easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins .
in addition to the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties will be 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer this city was standing in seventh place in Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin in No.@@ 33 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though living quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in spite of the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe for the economic researcher .
they are also talking about forces : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs of hepatitis C Patent with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Local Court decided that Gilead sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs which you have made out of the H@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ l &apos;s and other inhumane acts .
when placing the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. official judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said Gilead is entitled to re@@ bate the cost , which were created during the defense of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck , with Gilead , is trying to domin@@ ate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck under@@ accused each other and took possession of laboratory work , with the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredients in the medic@@ ations of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton publishes its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in revenues of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ters USD 1 million donated to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister had an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , in Virginia , published his tax returns together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton in the past ten years .
you paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continued to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ gregation Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i , announced in a statement .
in a cr@@ un@@ ful contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ aled behind false balance and re@@ tra@@ ders in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers as a reason for ref@@ using a tax check through the control authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate in the demo@@ crats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ers , to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax tests are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already promised that his ref@@ usal to have questions regarding wealth , his donations for charity institutions , business practices and various other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ itor his tax return to publish .
on Thursday , she spoke about the theme for a speech in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish its tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politi@@ co reported that dr@@ unk@@ enness had not been paid for two years during the 1990s , and a economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax ha@@ st@@ res@@ n and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , that this could be still the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the electoral campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that persons the more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign events for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists , has its seat to exchange their tax return to their tax returns .
Buff@@ ets said that he had been subjected to a control examination of IRS , and is not &quot; afraid &quot; in front of voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ ton campaign has returned tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an effective Federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ ters from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 was registered as a salary , different from the majority of all Americans .

natur@@ alists in Tanzania are an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to hold eleph@@ ants in order to go to people living in people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ff .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ gu@@ ardian Foundation , which had already trained the idea about years ago , along with the U.S. natural protection , trained as volunteers in the North Tanzania , a non @-@ for@@ ci@@ less rectangular method to protect their homes and harvest without being hurt .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe within these municipalities a change of their attitude which they can withstand the eleph@@ ants from their fields without hur@@ ting the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ants of the elephant with a torch and bli@@ sters in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he isn &apos;t deported , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ ev@@ sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works bodies in con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition is turned on .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom ends up with a buttons and spray fine dust to the chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ce into the air .
as a rule , a breath is right in order to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility puts a throwing , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works into the air , causing a noise , light explosion .
Stad@@ thalle unanimously decided : no Ki@@ os@@ k@@ neu@@ bau at the St. Go@@ al Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ al investment projects of industrial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - does not apply to re@@ ta@@ iling at the core of the core as clearly .
the application for the new building of a sales ski@@ i at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ li@@ ons in the immediate vicinity of the town council , however , refused to comply with one accord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome new business outdoor , but at this location in exposed location at Rhein@@ u@@ fer this Ki@@ os@@ k doesn &apos;t fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath explained for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; challenge - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots had developed a media request , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin won &apos;t have an Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin , as there were Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between countries which can be called directly from the hotel room .
what happened in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , so that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote lanc@@ ets .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel indicated that the action is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it , dis@@ band@@ ed even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election was deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
this is really very sad .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a larger dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response on the internet , in which the people called it a sc@@ andal .
some were in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the alleged de@@ priv@@ ation of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written in another article that is pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Ele@@ ctor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel proved to be any exc@@ uses of himself and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The Mir@@ ror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to accept Israel in the spe@@ edy list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds , that the country code will now be added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ rans together against protest@@ ing Brazilian students .
students gathered together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo together with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of government for the public image system .
the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ rans together against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began , when police officers attempted to di@@ ct students that led to the police in Gum@@ mo@@ und and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their placement over the plans .
according to the proposal of the Govern@@ ors of the German state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ff@@ its against the Pre@@ sidents Michel T@@ emer to walls .
the most recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed president of Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was be@@ headed by a vote of the Senate on their con@@ vocation .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , with the repe@@ al of the sanctions , grew between Moscow and Teheran in the annual rate of 7@@ 0.9 % .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly against businesses in the country , distributed to the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections to Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further trade development is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran declined by 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 , compared with the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russia imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading post was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan went off for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year Russian foreign agencies issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travelling in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as well as the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record number of Irish tourists must be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of whom the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the city of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses chose : beverage emar@@ k@@ ay@@ ing in Wald@@ br@@ oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y was practiced on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the occurrence of a gun , three dark entities requested that their faces had collapsed , from the employee of the beverage , the release of cash and then whis@@ per@@ ately walk to the foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited , the police will not divide .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is open directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and are badly available in marina .
the perpet@@ rators have to be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way and from the opposite to the parking site parking place with a silver colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( cabin ring ) .
who made observations at the time of time ( around 19,@@ 45 ) observations made in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , shall ur@@ gently contact the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ ates to the gate of mercy
the immigrants from the past@@ oral unit Ey@@ eh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage hike from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; romantic pilgrimage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of all ministers in two years , the tor@@ mented round of St. Anna decided to prepare and implement a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgrimage goals was examined and one decided to finally decided for the Bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy with the open gate of mercy at the Frei@@ burger Münster , had offered a special pilgrimage goal .
16 Min@@ is made out of B@@ itt@@ el@@ ian , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and hal@@ o rooms felt on the way .
in the evening before , parish priest sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where Mu@@ ch &apos;s dear wife is standing there , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was kicked off from Münster .
the single day tours were round off in the morning and in the evening , accompanied by a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and writing .
but also on the way the Min@@ is made a field of field , chap@@ els , or churches , again and again to sing a song from the purpose of the pilgrims of pilgri@@ m .

on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ell .

the deser@@ ved reward was a common gro@@ oves at Bad@@ ge in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went on the final stage to Freiburg .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ my home when Br@@ ite Gold comes out for cycling .
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took part in the role of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the hunter made the legend proud when he was stor@@ my to home a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking win , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in London in March , despite the return of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as the Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian En@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed , when they saw potential in the carrots , which now has developed .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who were winning four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner round off the qualification round a Olympi@@ ad , but in the cat@@ ar@@ round conqu@@ ering the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio has won the du@@ el with gold .
back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , in which it drove in a higher gear , to slow down to slow down and to keep it off and to keep the tempo .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when these rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed a Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des had the chance to turn off after a weak start .
he returned this statement later , and there was no objection to the UK &apos;s rival .
there was no such problem with such a victory this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London &apos;s flagship on the tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again during the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if a barometer of our progress over the past five months is that successful five days are waiting for us in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible in the realm of the possi@@ bil@@ ty that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently most holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old of Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels very lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety at the W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had fought yesterday with orders in front of the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the respective Women &apos;s competition , which ends tomorrow and ends , av@@ anc@@ er Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot at med@@ alli@@ sts .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
we played drums in the background , leaving the resignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ ism and mob@@ b@@ ing@@ pen@@ alties as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks completely different then the legendary GB@@ S , which has reached its peak for the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , based on the lifting of the energy demand .
the future of the Aluminium sch@@ mel@@ ze of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operators shall termin@@ ate the energy supply agreement and thus raising all shipping orders , as the supplying energy companies hur@@ ried .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for operation of the plant .
a subscription period covered for 20 years runs in November .
there are up to 2,000 jobs in the facility by AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland , Portland .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of a closure .
moreover , it could happen to domin@@ ate effects , as the melting point consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A completed the Point Henry melting , which led the last year to a closure of the Fis@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the many years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of strong Australian dollar , and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminum mel@@ on with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in the multi @-@ term possession of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the facility is still operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the company with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L furthermore said that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts for the year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for large @-@ scale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with the fact that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to power the melt or power supply to the melting point &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have to enter into force from November this year even if it is still a statement why it has resigned from the contract .
analy@@ tics war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melting point in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ z said that Portland , Portland , said about 600 mega@@ watts , and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 mega@@ watts .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ her@@ on reality TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is in the cover of the prestigious September issue of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , descri@@ pt@@ ly reality of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ( with the exception of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ on@@ el and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of their sister and ending it with a classic program . they all have a surprise party .
this makes the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ ee@@ liable action almost any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the set , &quot; You &apos;ve forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a station@@ building at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls somehow at this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , safety has started a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the V@@ ogue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye west were in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , similar to a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertising texts ( according to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , 8@@ 32 pages of the grove , 615 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected that during the last two years , pictures of the journal had to be passed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Moss .
in the last few years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , &quot; Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , &quot; the celebr@@ ities are &apos; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 in the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even in the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation , is located in a good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to either famous or reality stars or young people from today , who know how to twi@@ sted a good Snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women that distinguish themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; position was always something ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called &quot; Mist@@ er of the Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings were high again , when the news release came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but to deal with the gro@@ ove , it seems to pass on the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is in the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes commercial for your gr@@ ass@@ ment of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells some pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their free time she is visible in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres indicate 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief most common areas are rejected annually by the municipal health centres , while the industry accounts for the impact of further medium @-@ cut transactions already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need of violence , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just Del@@ og@@ ations and similar have been referred to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the church , which are already out@@ dated , are preparing for further cuts .
as of June , next year , this legal services will lose another 30 percent of their federal states .
the director of the municipality of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell ten@@ ds that the last survey of the National Association of Community centres revealed that thousands of people had already rejected thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without being repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; in Queensland , municipal health centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who are leaving non @-@ violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and afflicted debts , families who have been released by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have problems of legal age and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means thousands of helpful people from Queensland to be forced to justi@@ fication with their legal problems without any help .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey conducted by country elections : SPD and CD@@ U
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) there are significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
this report representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition led to go@@ vern in the north , it is not possible according to the requ@@ is@@ ations in Berlin .
in both German states , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have a good opportunity to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD re@@ pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent over five years .
according to the survey , the party has only just under the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 percent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left hand came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time .
despite slight losses , in spite of slight losses at 6 per cent ( previous 8.7 percent ) again in the s@@ words of Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented with 3 percent each in the country &apos;s day .
in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD in the survey was to say only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they are still hiding behind the Green Party by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D is represented with 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched on the market by e @-@ mail and internet in time : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched .
today , the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer had a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was fairly ch@@ illed .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would result in a high resolution today for about two women .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business , and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers will still buy the devices on the internet , but they originate from the Stone Age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West R@@ ink format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browser if too slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen took place .
pretty proud the price was : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have imag@@ ined in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of a smartphone era .
everything since then everything is different .
the wise tel@@ eph@@ ones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone savings of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today the market domin@@ ate the provider , which all went much later as Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple has a total of 555 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telec@@ om concerts come .
in the meantime , around the smartphone has been created a whole industry .
the crucial breakthrough for mass market came first in early 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac world .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , all easy to use with touch screen .
Apple began its triumph@@ ant success , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the see .
they finally disappeared , the Black@@ berry has to fight .
the ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today , every German now looks back 88 times a day on mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessi@@ bility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in London in 2012 when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad carried great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and they will be able to achieve new possibilities by local @-@ based companies and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities there are already 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I told me that England is never going to be ready for the games and that we will be seated on the world stage .
the two branches were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row does answer each one to him .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of wit@@ ching growth , and a legacy of skills and jobs to be left in the whole of UK as well .
we have selected a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion of infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequ@@ ented tread@@ mills of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

according to one of the software vend@@ ors , we make money to get around , a &quot; Cat@@ alu@@ - and mouse game &quot; according to one of the software vend@@ ors you earn money .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ades on his desktop page , Ad@@ just Plus released a blog post , in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertisement in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook stated that his desktop page would change the coding for its advertising display , in order to make it harder to detect it as part of the advertising section .
however , Ad@@ just announced that it has found a new way to avoid the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the upcoming open source community and the outline are already ongoing since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media is in the fight for social media in the struggle is a strong indicator for the industry to be wor@@ r@@ ying for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people in the world , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and more than 200 million people worldwide .

advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of income , so that Facebook seems to be an investment as it is worth it .
on Tuesday , Facebook has been going to update its &quot; advert@@ ently in@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over it pending advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just a new filter would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared speakers of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication with us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advertising lock is a dum@@ b means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
Mrs. with prob@@ able suicide on the Swiss fre@@ eway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday when a suspected suicide of several vehicles was crossed on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were met by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss franc , at the age of 49 , survived by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill themselves .
it is still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened an investig@@ ative action which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Court uncle .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers do not go to responsibility .
in each of the two cases , a person in the dark on the highway ran - it was decided that the drivers won &apos;t go out that a pedestrian goes out in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted of negli@@ gent hom@@ icide , having assassin@@ ated a man and killed one night on the A1 in August 2014 close to Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice was drunk and has become conscious of the road .
the Court noted that the police force -- who had responded to an emergency call - in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predict@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA chin @-@ up : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably even hab@@ itable to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate phenomenon .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms that re@@ semble those of clim@@ bers .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 dens@@ or atmosphere once could be referred .
scientists have previously stated that the slow conversion of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , arous@@ ed atmosphere and slowly revol@@ ved .
the model lit up the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet proved to be more dry areas than de Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected even faster .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow conversion of Venus stated its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientists explained Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella due to the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than Earth &apos;s Earth today .
the model brought out a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by Plan@@ etary research .
even though they were probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billions years of --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light exposed .
their oceans has evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned by an ultra@@ violet light .
when you withdrew its Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide only remained with a le@@ thal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate control in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ on
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey operations at the Colorado River , and led to a s@@ lack of involvement in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look after a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have served my duties as Head trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey One of the Colorado Aval@@ on with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy thought in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a decision @-@ determination of decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
during his debut season , Roy was honored as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs in Minnesota , and in each of the last two years the late season .
the Aval@@ on is recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second game @-@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two plays with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and Aval@@ on .
Nord@@ es@@ ee@@ öl@@ ds@@ men take up talks again , set out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour force on the remun@@ eration for se@@ wage workers will be exposed , whilst all the parties part@@ itions for a new meeting round at the table , they said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed on to re@@ start the fin@@ n@@ process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has reduced the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the Corporate short@@ ening of the company follows a 10 @-@ percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the necessary space to come across the down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for his part of thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alised as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ creditation with the British energy company BG Group .
as a result of the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation in which the British had to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June .
Scottish Par@@ liamentary Council Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest labour disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea as compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with the cos@@ m@@ eri@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ ancing to different rates and in which connection the rotation spaces are standing with the planet emergence .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results , we hope more about the relationship between the mass of a star , whose age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s inf@@ ra Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star purchase of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now the fastest one .
at peak rates , these spread stars hit large quantities of star winds .
since those winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when an ast@@ er@@ ant climb@@ s , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star@@ ring by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable constellation -- how solar fle@@ cks -- recognise .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicate that a more massive star slow@@ ed slower than a smaller star .
vine compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with greater stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller as smaller .
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star purchasing of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mopol@@ itan laboratory to compare these qualities as rotary @-@ rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star purchasing of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for the theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , the younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is much about us what we would like to learn more about how , when , when and why stars wake up their rotary @-@ rates , so to speak to their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ting rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a disputed bas@@ eball star step out
as a result , the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
after his emotional back announcement , the 41 year old pro was shot at the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to him , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Particip@@ ant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a tenth year contract has been a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contra@@ c@@ law on 31 December 2017 , he served as a consultant and Youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he succeeded in the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
with the Hall of Fame @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members of H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys , there are only two further bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old can not be accepted yet in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so cont@@ ested its occurrence outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; took place between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to an imp@@ lication in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspected of having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor in 2014 , because I had played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are not dis@@ appo@@ inting .
while a lot of bas@@ eball legends began playing the big stage again in recent games , Rodri@@ guez was often sitting on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win any game , &quot; em@@ itting Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .

thus , about all the weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically resi@@ zed nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was present three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both in@@ ies the in@@ gest@@ ion , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa , another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings , which also produces lots of bad news in Rio in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the earlier editions of China had also taken refuge in China for fierce disputes between athletes .
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t grab@@ bed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the Podium about 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio .
sun was at the centre of a meditation on Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping dec@@ eiver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun was tested positively to the stimul@@ us tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ia in 2014 , but only had to sit on a dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge of Sper@@ re .

programm@@ ers of compres@@ sive malware are currently targeted to companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by malware qu@@ int@@ entions under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed over the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of attack with pres@@ sur@@ ized software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming at a Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s pres@@ sur@@ ging .
40 per cent of the victims are willing to use the money requested by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their pres@@ sur@@ ized software according to the observations of in@@ explic@@ it challenges on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to pres@@ pres@@ sive rans@@ om is considerably higher than for private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the claim software , &quot; explains Ed@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the research programs were still being designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the support software for themselves .
only private use the goal , but the exchange of the company was sho@@ ck@@ ingly quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it seeks a specifically altered files such as W@@ ord@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the replacement .
to get the final code of the code , the victim must be money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ si@@ ung Bit@@ coin .
however , where with private use the personal photo database on the game , there is a sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage does not fall when a Ran@@ som@@ ware beats .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to complete business activities , in one case there were people in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; we have always said to the victims , &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you only promotes the problem &quot; , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , their data will be given .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators in the operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers investigated the user surface and get in contact with the consider@@ ations and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you will explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , free @-@ free support websites or un@@ lock for free example files .
and are redeemed , according to payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay some hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ key .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ ortion , the h@@ ack@@ ers will always share professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write about a single person around a week . &quot;
the more likely thing is that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their claim software then in the form of a software building device to the actual replacement .
the existing malware kits were created by using the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of supply is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pres@@ sur@@ ized then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one can be log@@ ged in one of the forums on the underground , bought the set of a crime and contra@@ cted the software to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is available per serving calcul@@ ator .
&quot; it is usually over@@ charged the crimin@@ als with the dissemin@@ ation , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now familiar with many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies are responsible for companies in the European Banking survey to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful vom@@ iting , the perpet@@ rators instead dis@@ agree with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liter@@ al chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the claim is potential of damage depending on the type of data by multiple times higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators in future could take a completely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference def@@ con demonstrate safety researchers , as they could get connected with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of a so @-@ block heating could be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack all : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
even though the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the fjord . there is no place at any point .
the materials of the inner space are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cockpit top is falling down there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
it is not only a suit@@ case of 4@@ 53 l at high and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ up , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that &apos;s less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can fold up like Kin@@ os@@ essel , thus providing storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor .
the boot can be well loaded , however , the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
he should , however , cause his work to be somewhat qui@@ eter .
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the be@@ ating behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a direct line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment is open to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested top version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the safety systems , the City emergency braking system ( operates at speeds of up to 32 ) , the coll@@ isions war@@ system and the trace @-@ assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ isions are irrit@@ ated sometimes , because he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evaluated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; winning objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the remote @-@ light assistant .
and the intelligent tem@@ po@@ regulator re@@ acts on the type of traffic and dro@@ p@@ onder@@ ed the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore vary slightly aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive from $ 20,000 to diesel fuel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall to passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . 18 U 124 / 14 ) argue that no liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable for air traffic , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the fall of a knee battle .
however , the accident could have happen everywhere - there are handy to have a general life risk , such as judgment .
the airline had to pay no damage deposit .
disease fall : when paid the organizer
after their trip , you will only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of guests reported the same symptoms .
in the case of the negoti@@ ating event , a family was heavily damaged in the second day of her ch@@ tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ bs and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease induced the vac@@ ation@@ ists back on a defective se@@ wage plant , which allegedly contam@@ inated the sea water .
the family was the opinion , the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
in judgment the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
in fact , the se@@ wage plant was defective .
however the organis@@ er knew only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that the sea water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red through contact with one another - belong to the general life of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were added .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence done by refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state has to be considered to be a terrorist act at the same time .
safe is : our country will not respond to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we will not treat this triumph as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when offen@@ ders had to leave the land faster , the security will raise the security and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals by the federal election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit range over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism has to be brought again under penalty .
video surveillance is to be improved , which will be amended for arms so that prior to the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the last much discussed silence for doctors should stay in vain after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
however , in the dialog with the doctors , he wants to seek solutions as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens can be decreased , he said with a view of the mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ c@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social service .
teachers would have to be prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
based on crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ ness ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of excav@@ ators .
the chief of the SPD , Gabriel , said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a whis@@ per@@ ing for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel in the papers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère was expelled from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship before .
a general prohibition of perfection has kept for constitutional problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t do everything that is bor@@ rowed , and I reject the tra@@ der of the Bur@@ ka .
we could talk about rules about road traffic or witnesses before the court .
as at Simone Peter , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Simone Peter , threw her head to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorism packs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ pro@@ verb@@ s and a disappearance of the common right bring people no more security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the auto@@ bahn br@@ inger
it is st@@ owed regularly on the envel@@ opes - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the legislation will be extended .
this is a good news for all the auto @-@ sk@@ iers , standing in the aviation industry every night in St@@ au , when they drive over the highway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Street to the right lane by 700 metres .
driving can then come directly from the hammer on the right .
the great advantage : traffic shares early at the time , making it possible to improve the total length of the frequ@@ ented section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
driving distance at the br@@ inger anno@@ ying the driver especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days is enough for the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer to the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler Street exit .
from here , traffic can only leave a trace through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt about three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer the necessary load capacity to include the heavy traffic , in order to absorb the heavy traffic .
as long as this Eng@@ pass and the des@@ kt@@ able st@@ ony is going to last , the competent local government cannot say .
however , it is possible to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official residual period up to 20@@ 34 .
for extension of the legal ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation , the state operations deliber@@ ately consci@@ ously sought the traffic f@@ ain@@ ter time during the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be held at the site on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ IMA is possible to visit young people with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee grounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House is a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group visited 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee institutions , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young@@ sters of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , leaving little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to them to follow the performance of the Young Theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ IMA , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , youths and without a flight and migration background are supposed to be able to visit professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the theater play and the@@ atri@@ cal voice transmission are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in view of the rising refugee numbers , the association expects many classes to participate actively .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope on weather conditions
the weather has made the ast@@ er@@ pillar Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was perfectly suited for clouds and rain , the sky &apos;s spec@@ ul@@ ary , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather is to be good , then we see many stars of star@@ ving in the sky .
in the ast@@ ics are Persian , they are one of the fastest ast@@ er@@ ers with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres per hour .
they have their names , because they appear to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which dates back to the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep problems
in the evening they roll on forever , at night it is stun@@ ned with hours , and in the morning it is not far off to think of sleep .
it is all other as relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent do not find their sleep frequently or permanently .
what are sleeping problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there can be many reasons underlying , empha@@ sized Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for sleeping arrangements and for@@ en@@ sic medicine .
what you can understand , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , thus an entry and a sleep@@ y .
just these are going to sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says the board member of the German Haus@@ ary Society with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
behind them , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ ing factors may stick , but also medic@@ ations medic@@ ations .
not rarely is the distur@@ bing expression of a different condition .
&quot; very early aw@@ akes is common with depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ eks .
and it can be that different factors turn each other .
who , for example , has a tape disc , can lie po@@ or@@ ly , w@@ akes every two to three hours and are bl@@ amed because of everyday problems and make sure that there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one add to sleep problems to the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a month of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor , av@@ enge We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : it is struck , tired , un@@ folding , has difficulties with attention and the concentration , is easily charming , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping distur@@ bing , it is important to find the causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or also medic@@ ations - classic sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
located in Germany , he has hardly empha@@ sized about Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ots , head of the inter@@ disciplinary art medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should then turn aside at bed@@ time at the premises of the house@@ dent@@ ist .
it can sort out with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physician , for example , in case of s@@ nor@@ ing with respiratory failure , with kidney problems , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep@@ y distur@@ bing .
it is not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please don &apos;t hesitate to make a mid@@ day hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ xed .
you go to bed in bed for his normal time .
besides the electro@@ des on the body one carries a nose s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
moreover , a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping .
how can people get involved in the handle ?
there are quite many bays , where you can place for a better sleep .
We@@ eks counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , alcohol master classes and at night not look at the clock - then you begin to convert immediately , and that is absolutely impossible to be eligible .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ alli@@ sts in the swimming pool
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Mark D@@ ei@@ bler has been expressed by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V teams in Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took for the first time in Doha for the first time in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed themselves in front of his former ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate in the criticism of the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives € 20,000 bonus and a j@@ ung@@ king of 150,000 € should not be surprised about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night on his Facebook page .
the conve@@ ying system in floating sports is bad , the d@@ oping checks are very good .
in doing so , we can not compete with countries who are very much to promote and do not even operate in the topic of d@@ oping , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback after nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
exactly that one should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent aud@@ itors of the W@@ A@@ DA / F@@ INA &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the choice of Hamburg who now runs a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage done
professional th@@ ieves at the airport Düsseldorf
civil society attended the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed a number of T@@ ash@@ ore and bag @-@ teeth as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognized a gang at the Düsseldorf Airport &apos;s airport , which was known about police officers from the past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since mid @-@ July of this year and were gener@@ ously working , working and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m that had travelled to Germany , especially for off@@ ences after Germany .
they were exploited for over 15.000 Euro in total .
Alt@@ built , a few lin@@ den trees , in between there are still a remainder of the rocky cliffs : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in operates at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the street from east to west , you pass along the grounds , a refresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the façade of a grey house has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , who is to be dismant@@ led soon , will be built : by 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , will be illustrated in the last weeks , however , preferred by burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of the rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms , and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator handle had several times for a tough pre @-@ war police against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , the police arrested three weeks prior to official statements , un@@ locked parts of the street and stayed visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown property owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and building workers went down under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer , the street is peaceful : parents go for children walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others keep in late late afternoon .
in the immediate vicinity of the front houses there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left Viol@@ ence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children , are gener@@ ously generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the hood , they share the concern with increasing and cent@@ ri@@ cation .
it does not sounds like a jaw , which most mostly police @-@ pl@@ aster wish to bring to the Left Left .
the dit@@ ch , whom the Berlin @-@ based inside and the police are making up between house occupation and their neighbors , does not exist in this manifest .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average salary and a high level of poverty .
also home @-@ occupied and the resulting residential projects belong to Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including nearly the whole Main Street near the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under large police cars in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and were still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time the district has grown increasingly to the mag@@ nets for tourists and pol@@ lin@@ ers from around the world : with them the inhabitants of GDR @-@ times and former Haus@@ er occupied their jaw .
this has also noticeable in the rentals that have gone up almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them in the reflected discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were dropped with d@@ les .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; Left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason why not all neighbors may be seen as a problem may be that it is not necessarily affected by the crimin@@ ality : offen@@ ders such as bodi@@ ly injury according to statistics , according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make sense of affairs which tend to be more likely to meet the new@@ buildings and freshly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there cannot be any talk of un@@ certainty .
regarding the acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are not .
even the famous burning cars take it directly in the Rig@@ id for longer .
for studying Archit@@ ec@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is conscious of the Rig@@ s Straße - and remained .
therefore it was so important that people will return to their streets : from the police , politics , and the media , which suddenly claim to stress through the district in July .
however , in the eyes of inhabitant such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by le@@ w@@ less new@@ buildings in former construction work that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they finally are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well equipped , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I not gu@@ ise . &quot;
but what shall we do if someone does not hear any one ?
there is fru@@ str@@ ations on all sides , even with the police and the occup@@ ants .
for Zu@@ zo@@ oming , who are shar@@ pen@@ ed over color @-@ bom@@ bers , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to Kie@@ z .
who comes up should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub game , which can be badly compl@@ ain about noise .
all persons only presented with preliminary names are therefore asked to be named with their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee tra@@ ders
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has joined the refugees of Ur@@ bach .
social education supports the team of the Administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group Refu@@ gee , Administration , authorities and who else take another .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the honorary will be more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now being there , the ei@@ ving wo@@ mil@@ dew , which has a problem above all .
so some - less pointed out as much rather on the multitude of people wishing to express themselves as the administration wanted to leave .
looking for a management board with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , is an en@@ ign@@ ant wool mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it comes to organization , work with people on site , and also behind the scenes as well as gri@@ ds .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in doing so for about six weeks .
it satis@@ fies a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full official actors .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are located in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
it has been a serious problem , since some time , apartments for connecting butterflies , which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the facilities .
you need to place the refugees in their own or rented dormitories .
the cost of the building , the rent , or the renovation of these accommodations , must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibilities changes from the land office , community and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto is the management of no private apartments .
so far , it has not been working on private flats , as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore a common housing must be renewed , as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will be set up in the washer .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are practition@@ ers , training courses , education courses , single @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be set up or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , do not do a non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
it hopes that the work for community life leads to a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a greater heart .
so it offers offers like sport , contacts with local and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so also we jump administration and volunteers .
it is central to get the feeling that the refugees get the feeling she wishes in Germany and welcome you .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain to the refugees that it takes it , and it can be used to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
who sometimes develop the feeling developing , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate himself .
the clear majority are motivated .
problem places , however , is also honest , &quot; People who are not doing nothing . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth &quot; task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two in recent inci@@ dents fear radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small village such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite distin@@ ctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what mani@@ fold n@@ ai@@ v &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be a risk of death and if they do not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensitive , however , the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents also be a subject of refugees .
they would have been afraid that the ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ in order to bring them entirely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the school and volunteers do have to look forward and in the region after activities .
in the background , they always have a new coll@@ ision of refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach .
do Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer this question , respect the policy .
actually , it &apos;s un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we arrived not there where we would like , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher already has been utilized to integrate the previous people rational .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , as there are no easy answers .
chim@@ dorf : inv@@ ades with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew in various areas for about one hour - un@@ successfully .
two previously unknown men are for@@ ci@@ bly for@@ ci@@ ble on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the people surprised the two and beat the im@@ hol@@ s into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably the size of both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ zen@@ li .
they fled towards the city centre .
for ref@@ usal the police used several strikes and a police helicopter .
the ma@@ dness was without success .
perhaps the unknown in fact fell close to the apartment , or near her escape .
