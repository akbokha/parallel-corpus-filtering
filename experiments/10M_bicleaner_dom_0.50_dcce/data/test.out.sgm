<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>

<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses were greeted on their holiday, they pursued in the fast Galopp home to the feeding pipe.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He led himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not take a photo of photography.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and with the Chio for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal President, Silver bay leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already warned him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are, however, with the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies the basic, rather philosophical distinction between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="5">The one, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against it, as the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton commits to death the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He, on the other hand, would be different, claims guided.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will regain works massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates, and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the wealthy are increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, they say, Trump and Clinton say almost what is the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "democratic applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-ritual teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, at Trump, you could still come up with an internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and return to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction has also been possible to disagree in protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand and expand renewable energies with their investment program: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transportless trade agreement, will both not sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both of them, however, don't want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are supposed to be paid better then, for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US Dollars is a hunger rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not very clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to stimulate the economy and citizens wants to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep it before him, that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">The other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the wealthy, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="34">Many women believed that they were nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the awakening, because the shame is too big."</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy Chairman of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new labour action in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more labour measures in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there would be a minister, to worry about concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistants and medical students agreed to agree on the refusal of a contract with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted for elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday night, the president of JDC's Ellen Court said that the government had remained quietly "at problems, which led to the agreement that the contract was rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish countertop in the gilded room of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot forbid that Ankara wants to fight that reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handcradle, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the smiles had a narrower and very little heat from himself, even for its behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to be repeated by his "love friend" - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had heard so daze would never happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable conservation showed that the state of State of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his execution: the shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border was Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutentless.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The error was even bigger, because it was perpetrated by a boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vetries again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious test, the accusations of senior officials have benefited that Earth's own family have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting only took place, because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first line all the friends who he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions are hard to hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of revolutions decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal suit of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television approved cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agragrines are not allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is enraged on the West, since it's reaction to the attempted power of power as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continuing Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the picking on it is to pull out the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian State Staff won a bonus to ensure that he demanded the attempted coup support for the selected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well known for Moscow remembers a matter of agreement, which itself has a deeply seated fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace of the sea made it possible to illustrate Russia and Turkey, as it described me a analyst, "alliance of outside": two countries that are dealt and badly treated from the West, and now obliterate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support the contrary to Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks at the press conference, both of them had said that they had not even ripens on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey failed to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months, hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey killed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin was released unexpectedly to his staff, Sergej Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to special responsibility for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it says that Putin has ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Estonian capital, Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the Kremlin website, it is called (in Russian) that he later was a member of the officer and Office of the government's execution.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin on his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state for law and inspections on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin distributed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his position and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step did not work mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergej Ivanov was a long time one of the closest to Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was aired on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile on the cameras for the cameras, just a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power fighting?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once had been glorified as a potential president, would like to lead Russian environmental policy - pushed to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin who are cited in the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you to talk in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complained for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerges, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov was the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessional Service (FSB), he was appointed chairman of the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin was used to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, to whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once again, Ivanov could assume the second term of President of Russia in Ivanov after Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken from another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project's £1.35 billion is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The site Minister Keith Brown presented a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the Queenstical cross trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a truly epic trend in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a heirable activity that require extremely accurate tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the entire bridge cuts in its place and the last section of the decks is today in Rosyth a concrete deck for the Deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first lock is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure of the future is pioneering high and deep ground.</seg>
<seg id="15">Following the installation of the last street trams and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap between the North or the land.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling in the northern peripherbrücke 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate work at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at an incline of about 3% upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even the tolerances, on which the team works, were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweiger apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Green Party say: investors will be much stronger into the duty in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How can you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "manual concept plan" next to the next rating session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question arises: who should actually build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann said:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "we want to build up 20 percent of all apartments on urban areas in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favorable apartments may also arise in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big dispute in the town hall was, however, the Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban development program, which will cost millions of costs and has to be financed, is supposed to be an incentive to incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, as viola: "there is no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left hand plans to reduce fins for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, as a frying, the flag is a discaring of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet altogether: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one make loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about to get back into the price connection again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's amazing to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children go no longer to play outside, but rather, prefer to spend their free time, on screens, has been lamented in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">For Pokemon Go, people are going to get from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon go-Wahn, an app which is based on the character, which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of populations sank the interest in the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved through massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go received more users than godchildren, and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smart phones outside and search for Pokémons who were tracked with a GPS and once they were found once they were taken "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users after the launch of the game, that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 per cent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take it up to 30 minutes, "" "" being active from the sofa "" "" and "" "" being actively bored for health, because many public messages are boring to health and to come from people who look like. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, its chances to get ill cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon go is that it brings people out to do something in the open, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are therefore three pillars of the health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also vanity games, which must always be more difficult to complain.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has got a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the usage is repeated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons' success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie:</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine among the Women's Olympic Games in the Turns and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with each Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turbulences, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which was inspiring for many young girls of other skin.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Cocian, is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It used the black and hisanal female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one under female Turnerves was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterly Gymastics.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manna member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we will not see gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic champion will only have four turbulences in the team. in addition, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner at first place in private gyneakers, which are intended for training, setup, travel agent, competition, and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and family).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, Turner will receive their whole training and for families a devourful and long term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both athletes since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to ingest the municipalities of Auburn innumerable, young girls who will be inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, provide a more efficient and easy accessible gymnasification.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my trainee from 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 permanent youth (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality Turns to learn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of the crew, who bring thousands of young girls to become interested in Turns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team of Team and thank you, so many young girls are motivated to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Arymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to move to armed robbers on the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you look back from behind, then you should turn off right, so that you can see your attackers and go off from the line of the line, "Mizrachi says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in your face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike him with the knee to the lath and turn, while the attackers fall off pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backward, while they judge the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers coming from the front, the technology is similar - move your body from the Line of Fire, take the weapon and rotate it, so that the attackers can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, take the weight on the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backward and place the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British Reiser undertook his immune system and wordeflexed to a serious test - taking some of the cleanest and poor places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and guide Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk deposed his train to a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilette as well as a public telephone in Russia to make resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the decks of each object he used a Luminometer to show yourself and show us what he will get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," presented some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing button of a train toilette which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely outrepelling, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with physicians and medical professionals talked about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he abdicated, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his gut when he travelled through the world and ate some strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to railway stations up to dishwashing places of toilets, the task proved its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concern and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just right for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminance number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the sheets of fresh hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to be emptied after their Luminumometer then ranged over 4000 units while fresh-washed hands have a less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer users something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to look and at the same time explains the advantages of Probiotic.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought Brainstormings through which it ended that we said "Lass call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in colon health is a global phenomenon,</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a major context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal Health is a global phenomenon, and with the film, we were able to provide the consumption of consumers for more information on an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" "" "I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of things I have instructed to do so as the eky Russian toilet that is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to create them, and to others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents in particular associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they do not include at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals comes nothing from the summer-campaign with - and the vacationships from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the country code will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the German parliament had already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because the day so far it does not go: summer vacation, heat and land swampons - that should be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced of the campaign events are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most vacationers who are in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems: in the holidays are helpers that hang up the posters, air balloons bubbles, spread flyer and count towards the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and last days of this day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass a campaign for just under the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also concerns something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the countryside, disperse roses and plums a little with the people, as it did also his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, seering cold feet have received and gives the Chancellor Merkel the blame to the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We will create" "" "speeding up the ascent of the populists, which will now cost the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents; Merkel was in the North East.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad to anyone else to listen to other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual turnouts on market positions and pre-shopping malls with sun umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this way, Koko says, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noted that, in the country the base is crumbling, that it must be very severe, to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left hand, the SPD, the Green: in the times of the country there is hardly any thing.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU campaign against his Mitstreite is also self-discharged: "they must go there where people are doing, namely where people are: hottest, Golden wedding, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD now to a very dedicated campaign campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011 the SPD gained a clear view with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, Small Party, with seven percent in the polls, is expected to go into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">You are going to make a modern virtuoso from the holiday of emergency and spend their campaign in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the Presidents of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electoral campaign on track censors go to local abuses among the resorts.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the peak channel datin, curvt just with a houseboat by the Mecklenburg-Lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "voting holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were sometimes significant complaints," says the head of the perverse management of the rehabilitation responsible for the rehabilitation management of Florian King.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would react differently.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination: who purchases sound boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love platens.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the comment section to oversowing him under the pseudonym Nallele of men's economic age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the emergence of records of records didn't want to see a boom in millennials which would like to welcome the redness of physical objects, but on Midlife-Nostalgic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a record recently are of all Q4 between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbycollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older board sellers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray starter and wild before I stand, my hands hold and something difference: "so, let's throw away a loser."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly over to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers have been resident - there's a handful of fantastic distributors.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part, in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Reckless Records (data quantity: eight men mean age, one woman probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" he says, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not have followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now capable of buying plates that he could not afford to buy and sold items that he sold, when he was young and plet.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early '70s, that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I think was something to be young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is right for those who buy records, rather introverted and likes to spend your time, and add: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback. let's see how to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually took to their collection as a rule in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica, in order to know that record shops offers a soothing community of equiners.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez some of the older customers assumptions to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some disk fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the sturdful sound samples from the objects that are happy to watch the lucky jewels.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material owner than a kind of comfort," "" "says Wez." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like your social worker!" flashed a staff from a flat stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record for the last month have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found that 41% have a record player that they never use it, while 7% of those that buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I pass through a stack of Bossa Nova Scotia.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men, middle age) works, has noticed a "trophial aspect" of the Revicarnival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "a man recently came down here and said," "" "I own no record player, but I would like to buy a Radial record board so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musienslave.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are the younger people, not older ones who are slowly coming slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and Women's middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, wild beasts of the latest Synthesia and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz is used in the loudspeakers - it is good to see such poversität in our customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks especially lonely but brand-psychological traumas are hard to realize if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the panels available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shroughter than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve a lot, therefore the collecting of sheets is not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loved sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, of which it is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am introducing the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who grouped for a moment about Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - perhaps because they are just pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to handle them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers can send in the depths of Soo for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even the one that gives most of luxury objects such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least into record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and plate lovers, that exist in reality, record shops and online resources, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are presumably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security by record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while she protrudes an uncanny, 30-year-old false Moderator that rises above the shoulders of nothing suffering of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a selection of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities argued that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary business in those persons within the camp of Goods, selling cigarettes to Energyz, sell hairdressing services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy, of which they would not be paid for taxes and have a fire and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, because the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 year-provisional stores, but impacted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture will be absolutely tractable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants will play a much larger role as only people who live "in extremely short-precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas are quiet and volunteers between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des bearing, which is a non-profit association and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as an advice on asylum seekers for hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids's café.</seg>

<seg id="4">The defeat was disposed of the silver medal in the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth in that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless of this, the Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in its form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Brit morning will have a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Chef trainer Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap is hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be wonderful and ordered the GBS attacks from Spass.</seg>

<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijianic gap.... for a whole of four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a Brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a study for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the southern seavian, whose fans sang and danced on the tribune.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning is inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainers</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more bikeen Gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard huts which go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the coach Robin Williams, was there as she was for the second international Olympic champion in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter indexed use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins, which slip over the surface with the elegance of weaknesses, which does not reflect the type of the Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the ruction, a Bataillon is willing to contribute to the incremental progress, which make up the difference and there was no one more helpful as a trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he might be treatment early 2014, out of season, could begin what the interruption was to a minimum, in case that is the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervenge in the morning to speak a little more than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps a little, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeated how much me this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks is sent to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for a trainee or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the past 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark were to be opened, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "stay in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip yourself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make some Toller.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want to get a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">For next week, Glover will appear on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an international Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he goes to have little talent, avenger Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">Is it not singing alone - with 50 sincous people, who hears, when a sound comes next to it?</seg>

<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news service committee published on Thursday their own insights, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom ruled a excessive limited process for creating temporary employment estimates," the highest ranking Democrat in the Kommee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. ship, announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the release of foreign intelligence reports, "" "" the morals among analysts and "" "" gave excessive space for different opinions. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House in the CentCom Analyst in respect of a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector who were recorded by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press conference of the Pentagon, issued a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not be able to comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigation into the general inspectorate is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes might have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations had the impact on the question of a successful air campaign conducted by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year did not claim the question, as President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inassessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">Criticism against the Islamic State remind us of disruptions about the Islamic State of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, opposed the recommendations of many analysts to do only a small occupying troops in Iraq and caused little time to deal with the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hookers also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hookers, according to government issues, asserted that, contrary to the statements of the government, there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damalal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative Council for his excessive positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went on retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and insofter at the Rio de Janeiro, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff, which is to be handed down from the wristband to meet for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't log on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is on the occasion for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well be sent by these known names, established by sponsors and well-being-watching TV advertising when it would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports, which are not universally recognized: airbrushes shoot, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it reign over long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I don't want to make arguments for my particular lovers, then let me direct the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline bed has been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many people had asked that I didn't know it was an Olympic accelerator.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to contest, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and won a athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong Dong Region of China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend its gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolindler has a certain outer view, partly because it sounds for a ClownsSchool for a ClownsSchool as the one for the Olympic Games sounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a mediumer enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cardiovascular citys of his never to end, but also the grazie des sneens and diving which combines two sports, which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from Spain" "" "trampoline," which means a lot like "" "" springboard "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to hit a number of falling movements (turning, Hgenuine and saltos) before it ends up on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiaprox, you will be evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-member athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their quest to gold, faster, upwards and go over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another caves: that of the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it is enough to even touch one audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also that which I own while watching these games as something exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prert, seemingly difficult as an astronaut, goes to the top, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no oil into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant revocation of time and gravitation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and students of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming to 13.00 Eastern time; the men's men start on Saturday, also around $13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the level of consciousness can only be achieved by adjusting and the object of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his air-to-air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long, an alliance of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia, struggled to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that funny protests have been killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to interrupt it?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid group of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into increasingly areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people killed on the streets and the fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot down and killed unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos from the protests that presumably were probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security personnel will strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights requires an incoming research now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to unite this land and in future it will even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project director of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services operate closely with the Ethiopians together to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pivotal train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued continuously the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited to silence, but dissidents succeed to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent into prison, or were killed in the arms of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Severn m Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the digging in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a vast election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this delicate, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst feared that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced to forced the turmoil of turmoil in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitter feeling after years of diinkage in front of the surface will now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very many Ethiopians able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, so many people can still communicate via Internet-Proxies where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians showed that they were so many protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Apra prospering the Amharas, which come from Ethopia, mainly Christian flood countries, in politics and economy, while they are exploited to Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat-country-areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former realist leader, was up to his death on a non-evident disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tacttable genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was particularly vulnerable to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special commissioned to edit opponents and to make them undamaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lack this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mr. Hailemariam came from the south as Mr. Meles, which came from the northern region of northern Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had seen such a riot was in 2005, after thousands against elections were protested, according to the data of analytics, they were apparently stolen by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the next raid, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in recent months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendmsuit, as well as for their measurable progress at the poverty-control.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protests in Gondar, a amharic city, led by Tigray and hatred toward the Tigray will always be more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytics say that the protest will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronage flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want to merge his ally in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy to scatter his campaign by sending his repeated statement by President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the "founders" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>

<seg id="4">It also brings to his fellowds that endeavouring to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the actual position, which he could not be meant by at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the reference to a campaign events on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew regarding the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump said, Mr. Trump said that he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he meant the excuse seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump tried to let down the statement something weakening it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican Presidential candidate would not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prerted to Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling circulation levels on economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped speaking to the economic situation in Michigan, this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter being warned that Mrs. Clint would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasus to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said, the Russians should make Mrs. Clint Emails hacking, but he later declared "Natural."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump allowed to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then," clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication party that observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think too, he is cleverly enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpened the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has always assumed an estimated tone, since its circulation has dropped further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tried to excuse for his provocation, he accused his critics often to understand his statements or to be false to his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes his loyal companion to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of what provokant to his own statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned to the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backgrounds, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government ran under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister, it allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East under control.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only in the winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to hit the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna in the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floating through the North Atlantic Ocean at a speed of 1 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland was only getting up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland stop at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour he reaches an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes on, it accelerates the five metre-long animal on a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This matter of loneliness was shining, but seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at any rate from a Greenland expedition, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Muscle comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means to the vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is hard to observe, after all, they live especially in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers recognize a little more about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-bends are they, when they watched six animals in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young ice-bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadres that torates from higher water layers beneath.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen held between 2010 and 2013 as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular sharks of sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of ophthalmologists is produced before the birth of the sharks, which, in it, are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a much carbon-14 carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore supposed to be in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to hit large quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimeters the length of the smallest animal, the lenticular anchor contained a low surplus of carbon-14 due to the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his examination in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the contrast, all major Greenland huts had normal carbon-14 quantities, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493-centimetre Greenland p showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres rose even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females first get offspring when she is longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably due to the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland's hay with the increase of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record of vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">In particular, that such methusalemes live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, put in his Speck on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they tyres even later - and alopers slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals often are particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much quicker than its surface, by which the animal feed heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"so," a smaller animal lives so dangerous, and should focus on it as possible to have as many descendants as early as possible, "says the evolution of evolution."</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raste last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took part in the role of his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. the hunter made the legend proud when he was stormy to home a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking win, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in London in March, despite the return of Hoys, just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as the Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap, the Kian Endi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed, when they saw potential in the carrots, which now has developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who were winning four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner round off the qualification round a Olympiad, but in the catarround conquering the New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio has won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, in which it drove in a higher gear, to slow down to slow down and to keep it off and to keep the tempo.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert, and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when these rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed a Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys, Hindes had the chance to turn off after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later, and there was no objection to the UK's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such problem with such a victory this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "one said," "" "it feels like London's flagship on the tribune as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again during the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If a barometer of our progress over the past five months is that successful five days are waiting for us in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is possible in the realm of the possibilty that he repeated Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently most holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old of Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels very lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "one said," "" "when he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety at the Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with orders in front of the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective Women's competition, which ends tomorrow and ends, avancer Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot at medallists.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">We played drums in the background, leaving the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the middle of Sexism and mobbingpenalties as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks completely different then the legendary GBS, which has reached its peak for the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="17">They are really talented women that distinguish themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Nokia Communicator was launched on the market by e-mail and internet in time: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator was launched.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, the successors dominate the world - its manufacturer had a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was fairly chilled.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would result in a high resolution today for about two women.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the business, and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers will still buy the devices on the internet, but they originate from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hannover as an "office in the West Rink format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible by HTML-browser if too slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen took place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pretty proud the price was: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphones in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of a smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The wise telephones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone savings of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market dominate the provider, which all went much later as Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, Samsung and Apple has a total of 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">To do this, the well-ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecom concerts come.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, around the smartphone has been created a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough for mass market came first in early 2007, at that time, Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of iPhones at the Mac world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide pressing hacker her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of compressive malware are currently targeted to companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by malware quintentions under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed over the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of attack with pressurized software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming at a Ransomware's pressurging.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims are willing to use the money requested by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their pressurized software according to the observations of inexplicit challenges on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to prespressive ransom is considerably higher than for private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the claim software," explains Edebytes-Chief Marcin Kleccynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the research programs were still being designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the support software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private use the goal, but the exchange of the company was shockingly quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it seeks a specifically altered files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final code of the code, the victim must be money - usually in the form of the Crypsiung Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where with private use the personal photo database on the game, there is a sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage does not fall when a Ransomware beats.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to complete business activities, in one case there were people in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we have always said to the victims," Don't pay, you only promotes the problem "," explains Kleccynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, their data will be given.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers investigated the user surface and get in contact with the considerations and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, free-free support websites or unlock for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are redeemed, according to payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to pay some hard negotiate and five-digit sums to get their data unturnkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers will always share professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write about a single person around a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The more likely thing is that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their claim software then in the form of a software building device to the actual replacement.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by using the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in the scope of supply is an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressurized then look for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one can be logged in one of the forums on the underground, bought the set of a crime and contracted the software to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is available per serving calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"it is usually overcharged the criminals with the dissemination," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now familiar with many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies are responsible for companies in the European Banking survey to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful vomiting, the perpetrators instead disagree with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing." "" "explained the" "" "literal chief Marcin Kleccynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the claim is potential of damage depending on the type of data by multiple times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators in future could take a completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerconference defcon demonstrate safety researchers, as they could get connected with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of a so-block heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V, Honda will pack all: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overload, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though the HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the fjord. there is no place at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inner space are well finished and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top is falling down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a suitcase of 453 l at high and 1026 l when folded back-up, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That's less magical as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backbench can fold up like Kinosessel, thus providing storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be well loaded, however, the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should, however, cause his work to be somewhat quieter.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and therefore vary slightly awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped Top-Diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening they roll on forever, at night it is stunned with hours, and in the morning it is not far off to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is all other as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent do not find their sleep frequently or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there can be many reasons underlying, emphasized Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for sleeping arrangements and forensic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you can understand, however, is the Insomnie, thus an entry and a sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just these are going to sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht says the board member of the German Hausary Society with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind them, organic, mental or behaviouring factors may stick, but also medications medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disturbing expression of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakes is common with depression frequently," says Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors turn each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a tape disc, can lie poorly, wakes every two to three hours and are blamed because of everyday problems and make sure that there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one add to sleep problems to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a month of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, avenge Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is struck, tired, unfolding, has difficulties with attention and the concentration, is easily charming, has mood fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleeping disturbing, it is important to find the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy, or also medications - classic sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, he has hardly emphasized about Prof. Ingo Fiots, head of the interdisciplinary art medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should then turn aside at bedtime at the premises of the housedentist.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can sort out with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, physician, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory failure, with kidney problems, or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please don't hesitate to make a midday hibernation," says Fixed.</seg>
<seg id="30">You go to bed in bed for his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body one carries a nose sunglasses, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get involved in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many bays, where you can place for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeks counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, on the day not sleep, alcohol master classes and at night not look at the clock - then you begin to convert immediately, and that is absolutely impossible to be eligible.</seg>

<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensator handle had several times for a tough pre-war police against the project, the area as "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, the police arrested three weeks prior to official statements, unlocked parts of the street and stayed visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown property owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and building workers went down under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer, the street is peaceful: parents go for children walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others keep in late late afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the front houses there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children, are generously generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood, they share the concern with increasing and centrication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sounds like a jaw, which most mostly police-plaster wish to bring to the Left Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, whom the Berlin-based inside and the police are making up between house occupation and their neighbors, does not exist in this manifest.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average salary and a high level of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home-occupied and the resulting residential projects belong to Kiev: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including nearly the whole Main Street near the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under large police cars in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and were still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time the district has grown increasingly to the magnets for tourists and polliners from around the world: with them the inhabitants of GDR-times and former Hauser occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This has also noticeable in the rentals that have gone up almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in the reflected discs or freshly painted facades, which were dropped with dles.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often with the words "Left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason why not all neighbors may be seen as a problem may be that it is not necessarily affected by the criminality: offenders such as bodily injury according to statistics, according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make sense of affairs which tend to be more likely to meet the newbuildings and freshly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">Regarding the acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars take it directly in the Rigid for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying Architecin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is conscious of the Rigs Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was so important that people will return to their streets: from the police, politics, and the media, which suddenly claim to stress through the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of inhabitant such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by lewless newbuildings in former construction work that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "they finally are condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so well equipped," says it. "" "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I not guise."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what shall we do if someone does not hear any one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustrations on all sides, even with the police and the occupants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zuzooming, who are sharpened over color-bombers, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who comes up should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub game, which can be badly complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons only presented with preliminary names are therefore asked to be named with their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee traders</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has joined the refugees of Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social education supports the team of the Administration of Achim Grockenberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugee, Administration, authorities and who else take another.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group indicates that the honorary will be more than thankful that Deuschle is now being there, the eiving womildew, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less pointed out as much rather on the multitude of people wishing to express themselves as the administration wanted to leave.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a management board with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, is an enignant wool milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it comes to organization, work with people on site, and also behind the scenes as well as grids.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in doing so for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It satisfies a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle honors and full official actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are located in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem, since some time, apartments for connecting butterflies, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to place the refugees in their own or rented dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the building, the rent, or the renovation of these accommodations, must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changes from the land office, community and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto is the management of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it has not been working on private flats, as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore a common housing must be renewed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will be set up in the washer.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are practitioners, training courses, education courses, single-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be set up or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, do not do a non-profit work - and that motivated and very neat as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for community life leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But he does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a greater heart.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers like sport, contacts with local and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also we jump administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central to get the feeling that the refugees get the feeling she wishes in Germany and welcome you.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain to the refugees that it takes it, and it can be used to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometimes develop the feeling developing, he could not help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem places, however, is also honest, "People who are not doing nothing." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth" task. "</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two in recent incidents fear radicalization, even in a small village such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite distinctly," "" "what manifold naiv" "" "may be a risk of death and if they do not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive, however, the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also be a subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have been afraid that the assassassassin order to bring them entirely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the school and volunteers do have to look forward and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new collision of refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question, respect the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it's unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we arrived not there where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher already has been utilized to integrate the previous people rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, as there are no easy answers.</seg>
