Obama receives Obama
the relation between Obama and Netanyahu is not right @-@ use .
the two wanted to address the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teheran on the dest@@ abil@@ ise measures in the Middle East .
but with the meeting , it is also said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the argu@@ ing two @-@ state solution .
the ratio between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington is critici@@ zed for the establishment of the establishment of Israel and achieves the loose will of peace in the peace process .
through the deal created by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated even further .
in March , Netanyahu had held an invitation to the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress , which was held in his address against Obama .
the speech was not spoke with Obama , a meeting had refused to come down with regard to the coming election in Israel .
one call is a professor , having shot up his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told a somewhat c@@ itt@@ al voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that his servants would have to come into his house .
the Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; live , but I was likely to be excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the House officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that was upon a white block , I wanted to reverse it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to information from the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that the Lamb , who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed in the police according to the police , called E@@ than Schmidt , to his office .
Delta State University Police Regulations , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that univers@@ ally @-@ workers have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that He has made the fatal emergency call sometime .
until the end of the day there was another death : the lamb took the life , when the police sh@@ amed him .
one day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still attempt to make a picture of it , what Lamb motivated .
the details of the lab@@ ors at the two ends of the State were published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped me to mark a painting of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , said that he has no history of violence or criminal law .
Schmidt himself mentioned himself in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he mentioned his academic life .
both teachers in the department of social sciences and history , whose teachers comprising 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tenden@@ cies to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
one student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who praised Lamb , said he seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that he had told him to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any illness for health reasons .
in this year he set up only two online courses .
the latest amendments to the university &apos;s employment policy has noted that the promotion , for the Lamb is working so hard , would not provide for an automatic path for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor .
univers@@ ally President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something made in Mr Lam@@ bs ! &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer Lamb .
after the escape of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b &apos;s trace , when he returned into Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , Lamb has killed himself by a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; walk on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ onal meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it wasn &apos;t clear why the lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
back in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has around 3,500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and educational theory .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of living Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when they met their friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who attempted to teach the guitar game a few years .
at that time he was the women of the women of women .
all the girls are ref@@ using when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
the Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss was obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick house that divided into a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but friends stayed and one daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Me , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb interested and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ sa , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arose three years ago , both on a summer year@@ market .
later they played together with one or another G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en told his daughter and sings its own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked online for several companies .
Mike Sha@@ cus@@ a , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes sub@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night in the night of September 5 , after Lamb stopped his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a sudden audience .
there were no indication that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the meeting and sporting with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised on American inhabitants and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married with three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , where lecturer , employees , students and members of the congregation took part in a candle commem@@ oration .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt likewise participated in the ahn@@ aw@@ ful morning , while the University right &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes will be started on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io soli@@ ds reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press folder Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect conflic@@ ting that the police proves that Lamb has shot dead , and that he described Schmidt in his emergency number while his wife described him , but there was no indication that the two had ever married .

Michael J. Fox comments on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theatre on the roy@@ als , and I perceive that the seat is empty beside me , and it became clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in mind that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated track and an arm &apos;s length being removed with the Princess of Wales on a date .

UN Security Council says , There is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon , his answer to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will suffer violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Security Council again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and integ@@ rative negotiations on the Find of a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Five Permanent Member States of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ ts that the resolutions in the Council and the regional Po@@ wers &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
indeed , Ban required the five permanent members to show the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal struck with Iran .
8 speci@@ ality values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious about to take .
some have tried to mark him as a flop .
some have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
it doesn &apos;t matter how some Republi@@ can attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump out of the upper cr@@ abs in the pol@@ ls , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit sector , and some start to seriously ask what it means the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Corpor@@ ations .
of course it is too early in the election season .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given at the abandoned Herman Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outdoor groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ y Super P@@ AC and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth is now recognis@@ able Tr@@ umps is now able to flow out their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current del@@ ist@@ rates , which suggest that the estate Mog@@ l is not only a temporary one :
Tr@@ umps &apos;s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candid@@ ature in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate market .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s have a positive opinion by Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion .
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of them say they were &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tro@@ ut ( 43 percent say they would &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about dr@@ unk@@ y ) .
the next in things enthusi@@ ast@@ ically ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; when Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of Est@@ abl@@ ation , would become the candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees dr@@ umps the same as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump Well is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ arians and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of those re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real estate is mo@@ gu@@ l the correct tem@@ per for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre @-@ state state of the nation , I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he gave the personality of a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively guide his office , and nearly six of 10 dep@@ endant , that his temper@@ ament does not rise to the White House , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters were used to the idea .
if they keep their sins , they will hold Republi@@ can voters tr@@ ump for real .
if asking if one wins the most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , four out of ten , after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C , say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time of July , when four of ten by the end of July abandoned its money to Je@@ b Bush .
in a full publication : GO@@ P elec@@ tors in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans think that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination ahead of only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ umps campaign will see as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is defeated almost everybody .
some experts predi@@ ct that the fra@@ c@@ tured field is likely to work as a tr@@ umps , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is spread to over a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , cont@@ ender have harvested multi @-@ term support .
he pointed to Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ herself and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
this is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur for 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters I will say that they have taken their voices .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open , to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the most common competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ on@@ ites , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often as tr@@ ump .
six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with the theme of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign immig@@ rated two months ago from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ing woman , &quot; was the immigration and fishing tackle in the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the sti@@ cky inc@@ enti@@ bility of slip out by the Republi@@ can Party is far away from Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
however , following the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they are able to agree with the questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do it apparently .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
now , at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , approximately half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls , mostly through its suburbs .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ s say in the new Mont@@ t survey of ABC / post , they rather want a political out@@ sider of somebody with government experience .
and they are also mad to Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent dis@@ satisfaction &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wooden ten@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ky way , there is the most expensive complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter square meter farmhouse with an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is contained in natural terms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which specific locations will cost one square meter most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student body in Munich not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top housing , however , one of the prices occurs as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service providers &apos; Angel &amp; Nations has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square interest rates in extreme high@@ s .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , to who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not close at the top here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Mu@@ eller and Göt@@ ze
desp@@ air in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hits from Thomas Müller before the FC Bayern paved the way for a comp@@ acted 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ a@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign start to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Goth@@ ze have signed a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan , &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel in Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Prime Minister Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to m@@ iller double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and I@@ ts hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth stage success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally arrive at the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller , in his 28th place in the Champions League , led a viol@@ ate family @-@ assistance of Olympic Games @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper of Roberto , who allowed it to happen as a f@@ lange of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the game in the caravan site in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 with h@@ ottest fans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without stopping .
Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six hom@@ eg@@ ame games in the Royal Class , including the renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund Germany finished here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , the Bavarian were defeated , but didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they were bra@@ ving to influence in their offensive endeav@@ ours , but often to be affected .
the attacks have often been introduced to the lens outside of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortun@@ ate enough to hit his flan@@ k from the right hemisphere in the left upper toe .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of it was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympics @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown presented the head of Poland from the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct help , the go@@ al@@ keeper will be par@@ ted with the knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria had been used as a dominant game , Pir@@ e was able to build con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous monks .
however , in Tor@@ ris@@ er Manuel New , it was c@@ auti@@ ous .
like about when he turned a shot of ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new gig made by David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at &apos;s centre , which made it well .
Mario Go@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , then sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he had given the green light after the final training , he said member of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to do something different from this , it is already bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Mu@@ ch made an dr@@ um@@ bed .
before the game it was at the Stadium for Kra@@ w@@ ler .
after a smaller group of partially sti@@ cky Bavaria @-@ fans in her audience @-@ blo@@ c obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of Pir@@ a@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went to Munich followers .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , it doesn &apos;t just sho@@ ots only the lung , but also the teeth - that puts in Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of zi@@ pper the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth out early .
this is a long @-@ term study of international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers was the risk of losing their teeth early in order to lose the 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental loss of tooth dec@@ ay and inflamm@@ ation of the gum line , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , stressed the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of dental loss therefore goes back to common dent@@ ures in smokers .
however , if smoking is not increased , the risk of c@@ aries is increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk within a short time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could take over ten years , until the end@@ an@@ gering back to the level of non @-@ smokers , firstly declared Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , stated study director H@@ einer Bo@@ er from DI@@ E.@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to a good dental health until high age .
in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by non@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ E.@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of premature fail@@ ures .
the new long @-@ term study maintains the findings .

EU Commission proposes to dispute over the TT@@ IP of the TT@@ IP .
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to def@@ en@@ its over the trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreements , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private sha@@ ding facilities for disputes between corporations and countries are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system that is equivalent to more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; we want to set up a system known to the citizens of their trust , &quot; declared the responsible EU Commissioner C@@ eci@@ lia Malm@@ ström won ahead of their performance .
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free European talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
the TT@@ IP is expected to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for Reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings shall see in particular that the EU states and the U.S. will be able to select an independent judge jointly for a new International Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and the third countries .
for the first time a second instance is foreseen .
it would allow them to rise against jud@@ gements .
so far , the process of proce@@ eding agreed among the arbit@@ rators - there was no appeal against their sentence .
in the discussion of recent months , it was clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice . &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an International Investment Court .
there , for example , disputes between the Chinese and EU countries could also be resolved .
the main reasons for the major resistance of the major resistance in Europe were considered to be one of the major challenges of the major resistance in Europe ( IS@@ DS ) .
the traditional arbit@@ ration lights are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of elec@@ ts , about the company damages @-@ damages of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to the national laws or a decrease of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first draft opinions published anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ a@@ ign the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
criti@@ z@@ zed , it was not intended to apply free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) in the Free Trade Agreement .
the German economic State Secretary Matthias An@@ tim@@ ers ( SPD ) , however , defined the plans as a major adv@@ ancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission regarding the reform essential points , the Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is of the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Bus@@ in@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the pi@@ ge@@ aring possibilities of the economy should be restricted to many new rules .
this was especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , as a result , it was named .
whenever the talks about the Free Trade Agreement of the TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) were concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations are ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investors was not discussed yet with the USA .
originally a framework should already stand for the agreement at the end of this year .
this event is regarded as no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
seven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which is recorded by the sh@@ y @-@ acting fol@@ ks@@ änger in the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is close to Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places that he always engraved on the card , whereby over his min@@ ut@@ ory and tender arranged songs have arranged .
where they were created , and how it looks , in his native country .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings &apos; from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; the Great Lake State &quot; releases its clever songs which can make a harmon@@ ious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be put into the great op@@ ul@@ ent exchange at any time .
it is rum@@ oured , &quot; Michigan , &quot; is the first part of a missed series : everyone of the 50 U.S. states should be considered as a result .
but in 2004 and in the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and has a positive way for expectations .
reduces Stev@@ ens from there .
live enough for him and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musicians are returning to the series in New York .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ite You To : Come on Fe@@ el The The@@ oise &quot; ) will appear in 2005 a nationwide masterpiece .
trans@@ vers@@ y to ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in no driver list of the influential music media in 2004 .
according to re@@ productive experiments , Stev@@ ens served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) on very extensive electronic closures .
this sixth regular studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmable sequences or beats , and plays with all the effect and hall .
the play shows of the smaller clubs in the smaller clubs : the play shows here for the colorful spectacle of Neon @-@ spur lenses and large fluorescent stage .
currently Pi@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens served as part of a five member band through Germany .
at the heart of the Hamburger More !
in theater , he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although there are nearly 2000 guests watching in their seats , the distin@@ ctly different Stev@@ ens returns to the in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without entering a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears the audience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sla@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just becomes an addition to her , Stev@@ ens modest , plays a few older songs and finally ten@@ ds to tos@@ ee appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ dil@@ ns debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ est@@ ry
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut for the Prime Minister is anticip@@ ating tension in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tor@@ sion , and to create David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise , in order to prepare for the first of his six pre@@ defined questions , while his capacity is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour M@@ EPs from close proximity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ kers &apos;s leadership , because it comes to a member of the shadow back home after his appointment and his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , the Labour Party has prov@@ oked silence to provoke criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence .
Mr Cor@@ im@@ en &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has gained attention .
a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ on said he had stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he was accepted by the Royal Air Force in the Air Force in the Air Force .
but a member of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ine Sch@@ att@@ un@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Day of News@@ week , he admitted the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bi@@ en &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liamentary Party were initially supported .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also pile up in the Labour sector , as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with prizes .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C Conference , said Labour to make changes to the whole idea of limited storage .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of worker and pensions , said that the party &quot; is very clear that it is only against governmental plans to raise the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader to David Cameron , and ever since he has T@@ ory boss , in the last decade with the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , promised to another policy principle , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions at Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North SN@@ MP has said that the fre@@ aks of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front , and that he has prevented with re@@ lu@@ sion and the stre@@ aks , and instead , concentr@@ ating on serious problems as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who will be represented by the shadow of business , when he is not taking part - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues can occasionally seize the word , and that he talked to John Ber@@ loader , the spokesman of the house , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he would have been associated with politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ par@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; which is often associated with the fac@@ tor@@ turing to the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as she was broadcast@@ ed on TV first in 1990 , the fac@@ tions were considered most important Bar@@ ometer of the leader of a leader and his position in the lower house and his position among his par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .

but it is un@@ likely that this purchasing power will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer jobs .

inspired by the &quot; potato , &quot; instead of D@@ öner against the &quot; Pe@@ ak@@ y &quot; movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat are put together to a j@@ av@@ elin .
the idea took him a poster with a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration on the inscription &quot; potatoes &quot; instead of D@@ öner against the song , which he had seen by chance on TV .
since then , there has been a grill combination in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .

met@@ cash launches Boden@@ breakdown campaign to fight against Al@@ di@@ - reg@@ ression
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di &apos;s move in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale re@@ ta@@ iler has launched a Land M@@ IG@@ A campaign in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales offices and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen met@@ rics and IG@@ A @-@ grocery stores with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A deal@@ er@@ ships and suppliers are on board , with brands such as ice producer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed to IG@@ A stores , and shop @-@ owners , the con@@ sent@@ ed tickets to the South Australian soccer league .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29th , when the wholesale dealers for food , alcohol and devices will pass through its annual investors strategy .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ stores , and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern urban areas .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are national and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley claimed that Al@@ di s@@ quires approx . five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its initial markets and to take on all existing ones , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analysts &quot; Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley claimed that IG@@ A retailers can lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food@@ stu@@ ffs and gro@@ c@@ eries and at the quantities of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ basis could cost a $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes ( Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath ) .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern countries , mainly along Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ led by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers were the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley is participating that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the Food and gro@@ cers by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , respectively , will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within one decade .
so , Met@@ ey refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food trade , which covers about 1,200 IG@@ A retail outlets , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operative debt and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler being re@@ bo@@ unded , however , is investing more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in order to improve their shops by faster growing fresh food and to deliver a better selection of private label @-@ food products .
Met@@ tri@@ ash@@ s principal managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and shop re@@ tra@@ ys will grow at Elan 25 and hopes that the wholesale outlets in 2017 will return to winning growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ ks Kok@@ kin@@ jack@@ is deserves to be praised as a criti@@ que for his behavior .
Than@@ asi coco@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ b@@ gios and earned his view to the President of the Australian tennis tournament Steve He@@ aly was more praise than criti@@ que for its own behavior .
the younger of the talented Du@@ os , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always named as &quot; Special KS , &quot; got into the spot@@ light with the not@@ orious confusion of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Vau@@ x@@ in@@ ka near the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison who had to be separated from the arbit@@ rator , when Harrison had said : &quot; Wa@@ ha@@ in@@ ka should sm@@ ite the child , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ushing was fighting a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Ko@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that I &apos;m fairly en@@ vious to me is the fact that Than@@ ks to my view Than@@ ks a little into the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke out a bat , when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ age in the US Open , but he is not the first player to have a bat from Fr@@ ust with itself , and I know Than@@ ksgiving a good enough to know that he isn &apos;t proud of that .
but , really , he really was in the US Open very well , even below the very confron@@ oc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he earned a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little exhausted .
he is a very ripe 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is still trained in the locker area , it is good in form , he is a very stable and technically mature young guy , and I think he deserves it , according to his own services .
He@@ aly did not last the decision to take into account the prime decision on Friday , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everybody , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to a long lasting financial component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ ril &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has made the ascension very quickly , what people like spring and Mur@@ ray have made it . it causes all the criticism that he gets , but we try to make him think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempted to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ tra@@ cted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted on Serbian civil servants .
the people that had fled from violence , were stuck for an unknown time in a land @-@ strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ting &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried with insul@@ ting against the Hungarian police police .
some responses from protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants would be sent back from Hungary whereas more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
there will be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels . no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40.000 people who were forced to hide in Italy and Greece . finally , they were expressed their hope that the EU states would raise more than 120,000 refugees too , including some of Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
Hungary has not set his hopes on an external action in Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency , rested on Tuesday in two Southern regions , gave more powers to conquer the crisis , so that they could un@@ lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire straight ahead of his border with Romania plan to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land - after an fence made at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison fans were deployed along the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which stood at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us to rebuild the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also set higher detention pen@@ alties for the traffi@@ cking of human tra@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation formed by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government manager Z@@ ol@@ tan D@@ ol@@ tan Rep@@ or@@ ters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : the illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters by Associated Press have already seen war with cars and dogs already after day .
Gy@@ ör@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , a country security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people while attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come across as they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and they are accused of crimes committed under the new laws .
authorities are involved to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos broke the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process data from humans and push a human @-@ quantity to push it there .
some 20 managed to get there , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants was blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would like food and water to travel to Hungary to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head start Ber@@ nie S@@ anders at a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination of national levels but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is winning her face to the ground .
Clinton has now support the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , whereas S@@ anders stood at second , with 27 percent rise ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced he was in charge of the Presidential Administration , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are more consistent with the other candidates in their choice .
when C@@ BS @-@ news pol@@ l has lost Clinton in a range of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved a few gains .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and vegetables , but these projec@@ tions have reduced it .
their support for the men is distin@@ ctly lower , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points back here .
Clin@@ ics benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 has been severely punished , and being different from being on the same level .
Clinton has a big advantage in the elderly voters .
last month Clinton &apos;s lead with double @-@ digit margin for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections are to say that she would support her enthusi@@ ast@@ ically , if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some , and another 15 percent would support them because they are the candidates .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s latest Supp@@ or@@ ters are particularly impressed by it .
the views are more mixed at those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say the presidential election , less Republi@@ can voters say that less Republi@@ can voters say about her peak @-@ class Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clin@@ t &apos;s supp@@ orter is asked in an open question , why is the most common answer that they have the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
out of Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) will be mentioned .
the consent of the problems and the elig@@ i@@ bility of time will be cited as well .
as the vice @-@ president throwing a potential for the presidential office in the balance , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he was not to do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the local elections , who for the party would be their second choice , bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s followers more than half , bi@@ den would be a second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
decides to win for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ crats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s move ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bic@@ ans in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
ninety @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the election ; however , this figure fell by 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den has a second on this measurement , but the percentage that holds it as the &quot; selec@@ table &quot; is increased .
nonetheless , at the question of what a candidate is more important , Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions across the voters .
similarly , as in the last month , no single democr@@ atically elected candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates inher@@ its good results in some important characteristics of voters &quot; sel@@ ections of the party .
multi @-@ tru@@ ths consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership grades .
bi@@ den cuts out best among the three Can@@ did@@ ates at the best , while Clin@@ ington &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton truly is tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy - twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him .
in general , democratic voters of the parliamentary elections are , in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ology in line with their views .
with all these measurements , for example , a quarter of democratic voters had no opinion of S@@ anders .
since asking questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during term as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , most of the Democratic voters will be satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was turned into light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not have any impact on their general opinions of Clinton even though 36 percent said that their opinion is still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent do they see honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold their own and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled voters see too honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy at all .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes in the lead .
out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush , were among the best .
a majority looks rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion from him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in Poland .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , on the two candidates , half of voters will fall in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support pump@@ ing in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % over the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate on Tuesday , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son declined from 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ based in demo@@ graphic groups , and that is far superior to Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Ka@@ herself , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who has a deepest place , with 10 % support within the last month at now 2 % .
the former Province of Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place .
the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting within the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the pol@@ ls - it starts with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the plat@@ former , with 32 % support .
the most recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed a jump in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump discovered some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze to question this m@@ umps in question .
we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comfortable bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though top values can be measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea already reaches a trip to the Mediterranean , in order to prevent warm water .
a dip in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
for you no longer goes to the sea : at most 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea are divided into this week , divi@@ ding the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
while at the same time , bathing temperatures continue to have the Mediterranean : in the East it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , and in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood rejected the death of a Bar@@ uch college @-@ new@@ com@@ ings
for nearly two years , after a student during a Shi@@ kan@@ ous rit@@ ual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges against five people are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood is the brutal attacks of Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory rit@@ ual in September 2013 and settled his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death .
civil servants said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pounds ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeated attacks while he was trying to go through a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g mourned over headache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood called not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was troubled and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , causing the police .
they had the time to change dh@@ s clothing , his symptoms were goo@@ db@@ ye and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to bring a coun@@ s@@ ellor , said Charles Wagner , a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members to hide their utensils and made the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over the talk of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police name Wagner . &quot;
he couldn &apos;t revi@@ ved , but he died next morning to his injuries .
according to a further aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been repeated with st@@ ony injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the in@@ ik@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student died each year on the ch@@ ic@@ ane , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the third of five members for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for political attack and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make people responsible , but if there is an organization that are un@@ official or un@@ official - this is how we will move them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has ref@@ uted its affili@@ ation to the city group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
an interest rate comes , and the house@@ keeping is le@@ aked for bonds , and the economy will get off for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the story of the economy provides low guidance for the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the rate of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor which , like the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather to increase interest rates but rather to the period that is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could determine that the whole f@@ uss may be ex@@ agger@@ ated because of interest rate increases .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted under a few times a signal for the end of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest at normal heights , but still at low level to go to the seis@@ mic shock , which seem to be feared .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends , based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , inser@@ tion of interest rate increases things can be volatile for a while .
once the increase in place , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently a tendency to wealth tax from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , thus reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study on what had happened to interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is generally most common in the up@@ swing - about 14 percent - on the way to interest @-@ rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average yield of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Chef @-@ Strat@@ ege at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank told that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the high @-@ volume cycle and returns to lower the margin .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest @-@ rate increases it often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that it wasn &apos;t doing before and that they could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point in the acceptance of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 sc@@ an@@ ings have only been accounted for by the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although in the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect for the third quarter according to data of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inser@@ ts for so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cont@@ ends the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year to an interest rate for the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this meeting , Fut@@ ures @-@ trade provide only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all @-@ time cycles of 1950 to now have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and before rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ations were put very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest serving the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l as the market assumes a interest rate cut , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course .
in case of bonds the yields appear to change the direction , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the high @-@ level cycle , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believed that the increase in interest rates will result in that yields between longer and shorter bonds make it closer and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what is interesting is , Jones says that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the inflation rate of inflation , there are some signs that the market adapted to the view of tough@@ er monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest are increased , the term of profit is fl@@ atter , l@@ ending sp@@ un has increased and the volume has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has increased its strategy .
in the large and full scale companies , who are able to consoli@@ date the larger area of business activities in the United States , profit from it if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse since an increasing number of dollars is becoming more expensive in the global market and as well as financing its debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positive for three months after the initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet managed to sur@@ pass companies with weak balance after each of these interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volumes in their shares even exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by aver@@ aging 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
consumers will also benefit from the real share of the stock .
as@@ par@@ agus could see prizes by higher yields , even if experts are of different opinion , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , a member of the board of Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of his &quot; pollution &quot;
he argued that he is not to be distinguished by any commercial rival .
he also gave the BBC Music Awards , and said it only in The Br@@ its .
mates @-@ colleague Dami@@ en Collins received the mission The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; at Classic FM , claims by a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something of doing the private broad@@ caster .
the conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that publicly @-@ legal radio stations &quot; suspected &quot; and increasingly would no longer be able to distinguish between his commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I do not use the word &quot; or@@ ying &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also gave the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples in which you just have to quote what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director proved the preliminary conclusions and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to the public about live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m nowhere to learn classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works into action , I think it is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey said that harder it has to be working to get the audience as it did this in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the S@@ election of Culture , Media and Sports , came under fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on its feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ president Dami@@ en Collins @-@ The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly mark@@ edly ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George , as a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hit from our house &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it star@@ red the next time a maintenance series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order of any other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of fee @-@ tax@@ pay@@ ers for other enter@@ taining formats .
net sales rose at the slow@@ est in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were already seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales reinforced three years ago through the use of mobile phones to buy .
experts believe that the black Friday , in November , has slow@@ down in spending .
for over a decade the virtual shopping was to be drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed into ghost cities .
yet experts say that there are signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sale of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales rose considerably three years ago , when the buyer was to take home with his cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but they all come to work , and we will probably experience that growth reduces their growth .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is quoted as one reason for its discontinued sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases in front of this event , taking place each Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some other re@@ ta@@ iled websites collapsed .
experts believe that black Friday , in which the buyer could fight against tra@@ ps , ordered buyers to make purchases of it .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases now is carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online instead of the fashion chains in the cities .
Muslims are buried in Mek@@ ka near the crane accident - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial phases of Mec@@ ca by the roads
Saudi Arabia puts the breakdown in some of the gigantic Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured since the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury them killed when a crane collapsed in Mek@@ ka Grand mosque .
her@@ ing @-@ filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to bra@@ ve their respect than the first of the dead played their last voyage to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ is@@ m cemetery .

among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was the crane to under@@ line .
Mr Ak@@ ram was one of his parents at the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ in at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials already declared that the h@@ add@@ ling went towards Mec@@ ca with thousands which will continue to come to the city .
today , king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden , said , could not leave the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
a Arab version of the decree pro@@ mul@@ gated by the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English language service in English was not reported in this detail , however , said that the management of the Company may be prohibited from abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the p@@ add@@ ling had been carried out later this month .
the bin Laden has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not at their opinion .
the Royal Decree indicated also the group because of not current security measures , because they had not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .

the Bin Laden family has been associated with the host family of Saudi Arabia for decades and offers greater construction projects .
the deceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a rebellious son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy and healthy .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
govern@@ ors ruled that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the relatives of the killed accident and the same amount at the last one .
other verses receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss states that the time of the cheapest East European tra@@ ps is over
Brit@@ ons deal increasingly tra@@ des@@ men , says Shi@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe maintained a rise behind him
in addition , this leads to 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
von Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or brush , you can handle walls , it seems to have apparently become a minority .
for Br@@ its employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ men in order to perform DIY jobs in their houses , the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
comm@@ enting on the visit , Vice President Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the cotton chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , the services for deep commerce is now out@@ dated .
hence , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores is planning to open tra@@ des@@ people and make 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , men weigh the men with their employees .
she said it was necessary to show the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female Single @-@ households , which have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; still a majority of men still lives in our stores .
we need to post@@ p@@ one this stronger to an equilibrium .
in principle , half of our clients choose from women with 80 percent of the decisions made by women &apos;s purchase .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also tor@@ ates her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupying about 50 percent of the team , including his Management Board and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - a great deal here is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group applied the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from a@@ I / D@@ whether for faithfulness in judgement
in the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ vi@@ master , a@@ I / D@@ ob have to answer to the faithful and job assignment .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with mis@@ use .
due to this accus@@ ation , he was legally granted in May .
the current process was postponed .
in the investigation , Robert Ri@@ ffel , At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ pen had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the accused were in use of club members between 2006 and 2011 about whom they disp@@ ose of their functions , for private purposes .
the loss is approximately 400,000 euros .
the sports functional are also charged for financial times .
this fact , President Micha@@ ela San@@ in , withdrew from the Board of Sh@@ ov@@ ens@@ s , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the def@@ ences of the un@@ faithfulness placed the defence , that no period of wealth was made in the association at no time .
the sports clothes could only have been calcul@@ ating and the sports club , which they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 and have invested some time and money in which it brought about 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we further down the club or do we lock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the defendants , in the bre@@ ech of large @-@ scale aud@@ itors of the financial affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money , put our life insur@@ ances in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money , there are only no debt .
in addition to the appropriate financial plan , the payout percentage of the allowance was due retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
there@@ for , one has only been paid to one part of the allowance for years later , as from the year 2003 , when a plus had been issued to the account .
therefore , the l@@ ump sum and not details of the l@@ ump also appear , and the former Ob@@ mann also clari@@ fy the processes .
the accounts and the divisions were managed by the two accused , said the second of the accused .
why off@@ ences were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked the judge .
the organisation has not been interested in detail in the financial crisis , that is important only to freedom of debt , such as the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of up to 120,000 euros was transferred to the appropriate project , an amount of € 120,000 was referred to the organisation .
these were the compl@@ ained , &quot; declared the accused .
this securities account ran on the names of the second accused and was not known according to the association according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
after this , the question asked not a question .
and then , he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosecutor set in the room .
the co @-@ defendants had been informed and justi@@ fi@@ ably the functioning of the officials .
this transfer was formulated in &quot; claim of claim . &quot;
why are the compensation received ? , they wanted judge and the prosecutor .
the sent@@ encing of the first accused should not agree with this formulation , since the association was never made a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the fun@@ eral , he has never occupied a cent content , he reck@@ ons only o@@ e@@ ti@@ ck@@ money and di@@ ets .
however , at di@@ ets he paid up 1,000 euros a month in bill , but the actual cost of the work was much higher , he added .
the defendants were unable to assign the exact documentation for the early years .
they had been aud@@ ited according to an audit , where everything had been judged correctly , no longer kept , they declared .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard packs more 30,000 jobs
in addition to ongoing personnel construction for three years , the computer controller will build more jobs during the split of the company .
the positions in the US computer ri@@ ms H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) does not find an end .
the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate clients within the framework of its restructuring .
as a result , costs in the amount of US $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are expected to be saved on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , falling from the fourth quarter .
mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed , has been running since three years .
as of the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
as a job , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent after .
the Group &apos;s large @-@ sized group from California Palo Alto has grown on : thus , computer and printing business will still be bund@@ led into a new society - separate from the future areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both of the business parts are to be recorded at the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ appo@@ inting computer sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers following its services , followed by the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus revenues were returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to a split and massive pitch shift in the sector .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the direction of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only been re@@ acted very late for customers to implement smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
the Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 positions .

however , a direct involvement in German soldiers at combat operations in Iraq would certainly stum@@ ble in terms of re@@ jection : 54 percent said , however , 35 percent showed co@@ hes@@ ion .
the fact that other states fly in air against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are women to intervene in conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respondents said , would be 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used to join the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Aqu@@ arius against several hundred refugee refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. C@@ en@@ Bank
the world observed , when the U.S. emergency bank arrives at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , coming together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is being raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think the F@@ ed will still be longer and the interest rates will keep on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is an historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero sector and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Executive of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and only generate a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the outlook on global conditions .
you warned the markets to raise to an increase , but the signs point indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
hit at the Delta State University leaving behind @-@ exc@@ use
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues before and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry for the first murder , &quot; he could do it wrong , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for Ge@@ ography and Social @-@ Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He has shot up someone and killed someone .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency department , that the police must send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he noted also that a cute dog is in the house , but he didn &apos;t distur@@ b anybody , but I will probably be excited . &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police broke the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb weighed 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen saw him .
univers@@ ally President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something made in Mr Lam@@ bs ! &quot;
despite the reports on Monday the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss already had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; triangle inter@@ relation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss works online from home , according to the statement made by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , had met with Lamb for nearly three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , Lamb has called to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to go into prison . &quot;
when police officers stor@@ med him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , Lamb left his car , fled to the side , fled to the woods and killed himself with a shot .
there was a PhD in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University . saving his CV on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( on the left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( on the right ) , had some st@@ res@@ s@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , due to cancer .

Euro@@ swing : Lufthansa establishes the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a big group of Group .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the worldwide roughly 1000 exec@@ utives around the world will cost the workplace .
with the pilot plant there are some new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the euro@@ pean noise parts to the Euro@@ sw@@ ag@@ ger .
the implementation of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to income of approximately € 500 million annually , from cost savings and redeemed syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ belt run@@ off line should be as an independent as possible .
in the current team , the CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of the Karl Ulrich shri@@ mp in the direction of Euro@@ slaughter .
the re@@ order under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ swing , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the future .
until now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the name of the airline , the airline is under a name for three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the Tari@@ ff Con@@ duct with the pil@@ lows cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations on this consultation are to be resumed on this Thursday .
it divided the union .
the theme of the convers@@ ations should be the appropriate control for pilots .
cockpit wanted to come with a projected recru@@ it result in a year with a projected record result .
the conflict between union and airline carried a different strikes in the past few months .
background faces the au@@ sterity plan &quot; Wings &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa in the fight against competition lines at the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ sw@@ ag@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are going out . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United may not play a long time for many months .
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven , Luke Sha@@ w underwent a double correction of its right bass .
while this left the left guard to the left and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w will play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack on H@@ é@@ ra Mor@@ eno in the 15th century after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sha@@ w had broken down in the PS@@ V area .
it was dealt with nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen , before it was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double pist@@ on and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , it will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later , and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s tough and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had a deep mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ tional , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a penalty .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , not pen@@ alised the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had er@@ red .
they can judge for themselves , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe what is broken I &apos;m , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot;
in relation to the background : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V defeat
the European Parliament has added an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France until the next June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the square , all very sad about it .
it is never the intent of giving any player to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gogh in the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponents , and if you then hear that there is a very worst injury , it is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who had gone in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad doing so . I &apos;m sorry for so much .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és de San Antonio was brought to the hospital - following a cou@@ l@@ ling of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child love a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book was asked to call Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , &quot; Cameron using a message on the website of Super Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always have a picture or a message we &apos;ve missed out so far . &quot;
all well and good , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron supposedly represents the story of the book , rather re@@ covering a content of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the pretty short text @-@ text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , to see the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of his dreams , reading their wish to be a real tree , whose real name Theodor Se@@ aside Geis@@ el was , and who died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if this was not yet susp@@ icious : the text given by Cameron is partly selected as the summary of the Lor@@ ax cinema , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that David &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . here &apos;s an un@@ called cub@@ s , such as local environ@@ ment@@ ing caused by the claim of the name Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , car@@ ving being , &quot; which says in the name of trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR &apos;s job was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row in a row .
one D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text would probably come by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s electoral office .
Super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there were no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expulsion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still heavy
for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , which England had selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not close a forward @-@ down victory .
A@@ bur@@ air Coo@@ ks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry any s@@ cars from 2012 , only a young positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was developed as spin @-@ punch or AD@@ IL Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on the test level , it is an option for the attack .
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England @-@ test @-@ cad@@ re from the England test @-@ test and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to occupy Adam Ly@@ th is of course necessary to analyse me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , Germany .
when there were seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple , but hard reality is that crime players are alig@@ ned with results .
there was no question at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this to - players are their own best selection .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he was in control of its own dest@@ iny .
if he hopefully strike a further track for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss acquitted her position , even if he did not provide such good achievements , and he did not surprise me ; he is especially a team member .
the question , how much time a test cat@@ cher receives , in order to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - as Sam Rob@@ son received ahead of him , while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on was nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to home and re@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation to rise was that England first sat in the Caribbean in front of Jonathan - when Ly@@ th was in highest form - but this lost probability is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a b@@ ats@@ man that I appreciate tall .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he finished 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends entirely on the team @-@ team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat the hunter next to Cook , which won an extra spin @-@ punch and di@@ pped 4 Qui@@ cks , and I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not leave his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he not a number 3 for them , and there is no significant difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he joined in 2001 .
he received three hundred cen@@ times immediately , and looked not back .
in afar Ans@@ ari Ans@@ ari comes back to the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited treatment with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may look at its statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers that lift their hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ al Jay@@ log@@ gia , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , because he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and will bring energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ al did he insight to whom we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room fresh wind , even if the messages are in accordance with the previously predicted .
col@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ day @-@ day , R@@ oot was given a similar break to Australia and I for my part I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken seriously .
Bre@@ x@@ it camps ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy starts in a slow@@ down in 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ on un@@ explo@@ ded new @-@ speak strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of gen@@ ius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n as leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who passi@@ on@@ ately fought against Europe on Tuesday .
ali@@ ens also have their Cor@@ ri@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats imp@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said some Member States , deeply moved into different crises such as the EU is it and not always from its own fault , Britain himself created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with sp@@ aw@@ ful conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive contractual change , which it usually doesn &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its turn to meeting that they don &apos;t like it if they are in danger of social protection .
we could call it Dave and George Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb at summit or bilateral meetings of foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come to your house and tell that they win the allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s look through more and more short @-@ term ministers and officials from some of the major cities to the point that it doesn &apos;t matter whether we will stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chancellor Angela Merkel is a te@@ amm@@ ate , but she has been in power for 10 years , and it wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her how the ex@@ agger@@ ated long @-@ seek@@ ers such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) has happened .
France &apos;s French President François Hollande can look for its re @-@ election , or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a confused force .
Poland quite soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain left one left .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they can tear down a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better suited to the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies have .
hence some such ministers could not toler@@ ate helping notes , quite at the SN@@ P style , while UK referendum in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , suppose my friend .
&quot; the new hearing was a Ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; United Kingdom has gained nothing from the new hearing . &quot;
Europeans know how bus@@ h@@ ers can be on their own expenses and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press department , as they were inspired by Tony &apos;s inspired refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , but supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ Opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his dist@@ ressed , Ed Mili@@ band knew who had his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley of the tax @-@ car@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers , and p@@ seudo @-@ Indian economies , who possess the most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir noted on her , but noted that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you might get better ban@@ anas about to di@@ stract him , rather than to become lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was ab@@ dic@@ ated as Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had refused the principle of the EU Constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press has never failed that .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n that gave me a friendly little bit on Monday in Westminster on Monday . I told him that he would not need any more time for me u@@ zz@@ ling - seems to be a danger that Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ k@@ oon Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old to repeat , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but it has to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to attract the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left it on Sunday .
Cor@@ respon@@ ns official position to Europe - I press it out friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p traditional bl@@ ar@@ re@@ b@@ ye @-@ tendency and wild poultry of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say Yes to everyone to say .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A B@@ enn , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; B@@ enn on the radio , and on television this week , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting fought in him , do not admit that Cor@@ im@@ en &apos;s appointment of the irrit@@ ating John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father was trying to settle on television , loyal to his Labour cabin , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle has even more attractive .
but to struggle to &quot; keep &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ an expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his Mit@@ ter and M@@ EPs on Monday night on Monday evening .
whatever the touching of the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n is to medi@@ ate - remember that he even touched me - News discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron &apos;s free map to Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ ary campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite @-@ ager@@ ly @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small firm is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to the exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin do not waste political capital - they have also mis@@ erable voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the United States have already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which at the start I was somewhat reminiscent of the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England over E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking made of a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the employers made by Public Health ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he released the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data collected and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month anticip@@ ates the &quot; extra@@ cting foundation &quot; in which P@@ he founded his main conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether the comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ een , Professor of European Works Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the basis of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ation that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single session of 12 people who have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ related products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( B@@ AT ) for an independent trial .
he also signed the references of B@@ AT to take public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting explained funds of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing it was to have received by Philip Morris International after reports previously .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied but also include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session management of P@@ he took part in the session .
the research work of the group &quot; is significant , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ een and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no proof that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no proof that e @-@ cigarettes are a way to smoking cigarettes for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life rou@@ gh@@ er dies on his ad@@ diction .
all the evidence suggests that the health Ris@@ ks of E @-@ cigarettes are low compared to this , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation for the information to the public about what is occupied , and what is not , especially if there are much public confusion about relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system cost two billion pounds per year .
through clear prec@@ epts of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give off East@@ du@@ ck , the former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arms &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge is to be used only in order to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making them publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ oured time windows , to the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sensitivity such as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company had to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf of the BBC , or who clearly shows that clearly not @-@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; said Johnson said to the upper @-@ house communications committee in connection with the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I think mid@@ - or long @-@ term - do not hold a good idea , one should at least get his production at least for programs , the others do not do or order .
they send the Voice into a premium window , as they want to achieve the most possible support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why it has financed a reg@@ res@@ sive tax software , which could be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ code is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give her right arms .
I will endeav@@ our to see how this will be public television .
I do not believe that the BBC would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC title was on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe it is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broadcasts across the BBC will announce that when Sky &apos;s former head of Sky , Tony Ball , to be held in Edinburgh in 2003 , the BBC shows that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more public legal agen@@ ic programmes can go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they are unable to measure their tasks , but they can argue if they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ans programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of time , in which no one would ever wanted to see .
in the radio charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , as of course , all remember that one receives a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is correct , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ line and Channel 5 head of David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday called on the BBC to verify that the BBC should examine its dancing mission , &quot; to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little from the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should participate in the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein argued that BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , by which he said that only a handful of television will be aired , and making these commercial sen@@ als involved to make everything online .
&apos;@@ s@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which it is radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled from bro@@ ader of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which it is equipped with sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pul@@ ses are performed by the turn @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new trial , called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , which can be used to ultr@@ as@@ ound for a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
the Guardian at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the proceedings of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure which gives an electrical impul@@ sion to the brain of people for the treatment of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease symptoms .
they did not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but az@@ as@@ ani reported that they did , if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out enh@@ ancing the ultr@@ as@@ ound shafts , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wort cells .
the sound waves also effect the opening of these I@@ on channels and activ@@ ating the cells , they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asonic scan , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically Modi@@ fied the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers are wearing .
when he turns ultr@@ as@@ ound to the changed creatures , sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed motor ones .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities to Op@@ tics Gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool which enables scientists to eliminate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , can be hin@@ dered by slow @-@ ultr@@ as@@ ound tissues , and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that suffering from therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily lay the human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in the residence halls
11 years ago , as a self @-@ forget@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence hall , still in faith on Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ derly sm@@ iling of those that I have refused - and to the numerous , long @-@ going complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules .
the entry in a residence hall goes from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell whence you come from whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ y , where you don &apos;t love any person or hate doing business , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s only a He@@ fe@@ ed@@ an ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show your interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you may not talk in contrast to those with whom you will not talk , even when your lashes made a fire and these fires are extingu@@ ished .
let people leave .
the rooms of humans will often transform themselves into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal forks , but they are also the places where people wear on and their under@@ wear .
relative : remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many students who inhab@@ it a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ m@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the Hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allow you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away to get the energy back I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a pe@@ er of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted and send it a text instead to knock out .
A@@ pro@@ pos Editor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
friendship will close by baking .
as you begin the Uni at the climax of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the knock on the doors of people , in order to imagine with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less stran@@ gely than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have somewhat c@@ atter@@ ed to you . so , and now please sm@@ elling if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade cookies is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ate feel committed to enter@@ tain and are associated with a pleasant surprise at the end of the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mi@@ xes out of flour , sugar and fat , make people sleeping when you like them .
steal food to steal , is an ongoing crime in the halls of residence halls .
of course , the chicken of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea too ?
check the with the owner of the milk .
the odds are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your things , it is anno@@ ying , and you have compassion , and you have compassion , but try to deal with it as my fellow @-@ resident who added her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ ieves .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , the people away from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , whether it makes them a bit , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an inspection in the morning .
they responded to the music with still loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning , she had kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she dropped their own music and went down to her own door , and went to her three @-@ hour inspection .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would be acci@@ dental to the same student residence ?
on the other way , it would not be deep embar@@ r@@ assing , if you have a resident of compassion for your future spouse will be ran@@ ci@@ ously split , and then they will have to see them every day and perhaps come together as they get out of their common friends ?
of course , the heart continues its own path - but if a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk about your sub@@ ju@@ b a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone does not have his keys in his / her not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mob@@ bing fine , as it seems .
a good example is funny , but it only takes moments until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson for safety - but never fail to make any one @-@ stock room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo effect .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but don &apos;t put your bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling not more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , People of the Ger@@ ing@@ L@@ earned
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the middle of the Basque Country Hou@@ sing Complex for people who have not much money .
for about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room but also the rec@@ eding Mother and the least deser@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview
thousands of refugees will hit the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ a believes , how rapid adv@@ anta@@ geous living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gal@@ ner , many refugees will hit the housing market .
what kind of solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ a : popular accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
with regard to the refugees , we also need a living room for the coming decades .
a quite ban@@ ker , three storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ a : a terra@@ ced house takes the f@@ ew@@ est place .
it makes the integration .
that is different when people are under@@ going into living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project are comprised of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
juni@@ per : the price of 160 sq m living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the construction requirements have stra@@ ight@@ forward their plans ?
Gal@@ ner : did I go through my project correctly .
it always makes it easy to make a special nutri@@ ent @-@ holder as well as the set @-@ up regulation .
gr@@ assy .
it still takes place , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns the square is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gal@@ ner : there were who they were accused of creating luxury seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition to make paid apartments ?
Gal@@ ner : true today : we had one building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we were build luxury apartments which can hardly be achieved .
my project has the message , including the normal people needed living space .
not only refugees , but also the rec@@ eding Mother or the Ger@@ ling deser@@ ved .
I show how you can build and build well today , even today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to obtain the new iPhone operating system when it is released at Apple update
the new operating system can be requested by selecting the In@@ to App , &quot; General , and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then Inst@@ all .
some are getting started in the installation , since they received an error message that suggests that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users advise to wait either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght of departure or to try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has more likely that through the tim@@ est@@ ation of the updates un@@ likely . likewise , it will be easier to er@@ ase the apps once you install a special tool , to er@@ ase apps once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating is charged , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t realize that the update will continue , as the phone may shut down on half way as the phone may lead to a failure of the updates .

at that time the group was located on the height of the b@@ ft station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men , then , cried with the young people , and defeated this with their f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ wound and ble@@ ed out of the nose .

Dr. Frank Müller takes up his practice Fel@@ low and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll und Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low ausen .
furthermore , Zambia rider is also looking forward to by Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Crisis in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
many of all places in the country are missing doctors - As@@ endorf is lucky : Frank Müller takes over the practice of Frank Müller on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich assumes his successor in the next few months with half a place .
after a reconstruction phase the office opened on 12 October . by then , he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ e@@ ath@@ y at first sight , when the Fel@@ stand went on in front of Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the moment had completed their professional education at the Order of Malta and will also get into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was so , I called it . &quot;
the lady Müller was right in the idea to pursue its own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; nearby and continuous contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we wish to learn and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he will see his own boss soon .
and so , they agreed , the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
they will continue to be resi@@ ded in Z@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also growing up , following his media studies in Hanover , followed by several physician offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Head post in Sul@@ ah , and in 2009 he was appointed head of the senior physician at the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz . volunteers are volunteers in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness .
starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ re@@ ausen works as a dent@@ ist , his wife Ur@@ sel ( inter@@ ni@@ stin ) worked on the g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both of them , want to settle for a house .
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy goes out , &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the refurb@@ ishment , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examination as well as long @-@ term and endurance EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
having a total of 50,000 euros , the m@@ iller received a funding range from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the Municip@@ ality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and we are glad that practice is going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Number Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are about 2000 patients , according to the Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter into the practice Fel@@ low , and in the nor@@ theastern Germany , there are about 500 people .
there is still another dent@@ ist practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice @-@ loss by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the village of Fel@@ den@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone too .
those who were visited by the tr@@ ash are also still familiar with their faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ low .
the departure ends in As@@ endorf , after all , the medicine he has been pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had just two rooms , &quot; the pri@@ mor@@ sel terra@@ ced cry &quot; reminds .
a little gro@@ aning is already sc@@ ure on it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients can still see a lot of patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the intern@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband comple@@ ments : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have pushed myself forward with gar@@ dening , so that could become different . &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border controls are also lifted at our border border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
also , as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to seek a political asylum request to &quot; of course . &quot;
the care and safety of the people is standing in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people need to know that we don &apos;t accept the limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor , &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia wanted to travel further into Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and in circumstances of cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
but this was not the case by the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana , but not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; but a must rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary .
the border of Croatia is already strong at the border of the Schengen Area .
as the minist@@ ries stressed , Slov@@ ene wants to serve its limits for refugees , but non @-@ abri@@ dged .
&quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had shared , the first refugees have tried to travel during the night of Tuesday , in eastern Croatian at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near @-@ house fields .
according to local media , since then , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police teams meet with new refugees .
they are mainly created for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also life @-@ services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country moved to some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ jic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo should join the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media at Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade decided however , that they would be wise to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; says it .
according to media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serb border city of S@@ id , during the day , further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the passengers remained on the road through Serbia all the night , some 500 kilometres away from the city of Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually be indeed the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west along the West .
Croatia : &quot; extensive facilities for control testing &quot;
the Minister of Internal Affairs , O@@ sto@@ jic , had previously emphas@@ ised that his country for the fall of a strong plant@@ ing of refugees prepared by refugees for potential risks .
he did not use details but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive options for control testing . &quot;
one lead the strict controls in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner sites in the country have since passed along a good testimony , regarding the standard of border controls .
about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to pass on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister for Internal Affairs , Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ i tried to calm Wednesday early during a local wreck in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keeps the debates about altern@@ ators from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for sh@@ ell@@ fish .
we are currently not acting for a very high refugee number .
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ pers advice to - dangerous - alternative rou@@ gh@@ fare
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees to the refugees in which alternative routes through Croatia have entered .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is , however , not completely harm@@ less : in some parts of the border there are also 20 years after the end of Croatia still no broken min@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance were sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex is mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Gig@@ ant picked up his winning view over a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its operations .
the company also stated that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holiday on holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation period .
the share price fell 45 percent at the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than at the earlier forecast .
analysts forecast according to a survey conducted by fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the overall rate increases , despite the price increases , aver@@ aging 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4th January and despite the higher demand for boat transfers of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that , however , expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and thanks to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is able to achieve a solid profit even if it is weaker as expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing , and global commerce . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later than those of the rival UPS that is planning to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra lab@@ our@@ ers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , asked analysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.2 billion $ .
six of the H@@ acks questioned analysts expected to be 12,@@ 23 billion dollars .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in the international priority supply company to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in its unit Express Dis@@ patch .
the boom in the online shopping mall has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in Bo@@ d@@ transit , but the operating result was basically flat for higher costs and self insurance .
Express Group reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was decl@@ ining because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
at the market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3,@@ 85 $ or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at the most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ oni Table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to raise the head .
dro@@ pping upon them at one end of the delayed , two @-@ story seating sa@@ wing as a wall picture of the United States .
the map is remember@@ ing that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a 2 @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices are stable there .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a third fourth rule : financial stability .
and this third mandate , the X factor , be in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed by an unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets indicate the already c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representative , this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds , and it may also be only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; apparently , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey , Pi@@ eg@@ za , CEO of the Mak@@ ler@@ ing of Sti@@ ron Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think that if they were in search of a pre@@ text , net interest is not to raise the interest rate , higher un@@ certainty is sufficient to maintain the global market enough , and continues to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed do , resulting in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a special rate for these weeks .
the financial markets are expecting a decrease of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists have dropped their stroke , they promise that a further increase is far away .
in Tuesday , Dow Jones achieved an average total of 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points , or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ politics imp@@ lies a set up in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in their declaration in order to re@@ ass@@ ure the financial markets that they don &apos;t fall in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a tick @-@ rate would be cal@@ ming down the financial markets , because they deser@@ ve the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed is supposed to be overcome .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to raise the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow col@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid for this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the levels that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation continuously proved below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them due to stress on the labour market &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ gen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the month , after China uses its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial coefficient showed a total average of more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would benefit the global growth .
the market recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow Jones Sustainability has now almost 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when it should rise to interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news would not have occurred over the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Treasury .
now he says that they will be waiting at least one month to get the impact better in the gr@@ asp .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
none of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so she should not be involved in decision @-@ making decision .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enorm@@ ously high in recent years .
the mere reference to the then Chief Apostle Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could be able to narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; might dis@@ band@@ ed around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , it can be expected by the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , but it can not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for assets management of the company An@@ vest@@ i@@ Inc .
Jeffrey W@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ acts on financial market movements , which seems to be not linked with the economic foundation data . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , assumes a interest rate for interest rate cont@@ ested decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia launched the F@@ ed to reduce its lead interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limit@@ er impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said .
one year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis like the down@@ turn of 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il didn &apos;t come close to this plane , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation in which she has afraid of interest rate increases , because the markets seem to be exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that has been changed , I do not believe that it should be projected .

Brazilian Di@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society for Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian P@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women in sho@@ cking ways how important the good diet during feeding time is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted to breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that require babies to give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only di@@ abe@@ tic adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Municip@@ ality of Bern@@ ried permitted the construction application for the 2.3 million euro hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof can be sh@@ allow@@ er to solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ desired turn@@ around at the amber plant is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent hearing session , the extended building application has been balanced without a large discussions .
previously , the board of directors still decided on an application for a legal &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ ting &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid building plan .
in the &quot; exceptions &quot; the permission was issued for a special form in respect of the roof structure .
accordingly , a &quot; sun@@ roof with non @-@ p@@ ent First and roof was to be erected .
in the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof@@ top surface for solar plants : &quot; we get a wonderful south roof together , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it again rose to the roof ti@@ pping , for energy reasons other than in the building plan intended to be prescribed for less than ten degrees .
the volume of the hall will therefore be significantly reduced .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary , because the development plan gives no &quot; exceptions &quot; in respect of the im@@ aging - whereas the Bern@@ ward is generally more restri@@ ctive upon exemp@@ tion orders .
however , we are not a recur@@ rent project when we do not create a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the cycle of life at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are calculated to cost approximately 2.3 million Euros .
subsidies are expected from school and latitude .
in the next step of proce@@ eding the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will be presented to the ground station .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be planned earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the mira@@ culous plans of the Hospital GmbH of the land @-@ circle was shown by the police Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
as a decision to come , however , the Supervisory Board and the governor for the next Wednesday , 23 September .
the plans should be implemented , then all of the just under 50 employees at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the overwhelming majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au , a large majority of fishermen and the other existing interior .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sh@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change also triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic until the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
at the question that he was supposed to follow , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game which will be ready to take charge from October 1 and to transfer his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ers .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in astro@@ enter@@ ological conditions on the inner station .
over the next two years , Fischer said to his team , when the board of directors is to propose to them both houses , until then , next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which has more than 35 beds , shall finally be closed after almost 140 years .
the district has planned this until now , when the current ongoing renovation at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital in 2018 is planned .
in order to meet the Chairman of the Gover@@ ning Board , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who also Chairman of the Gover@@ ning Board , appeared to meet the property which is in possession of the Federal Council to be used as property for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is where I should go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not tell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a cure @-@ care of the Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ ous@@ y .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so Fischer talked about the Qu@@ e &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; positive and very discreet . &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a head doctor for more than 30 years .
he was asked to have been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ se@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth assistance .

a susp@@ ect , the police have led to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate to Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
as the interro@@ gation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people had killed and their body had thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate was missing a violent crimes .
the young woman was found at night in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as Public Prosecutor &apos;s office and police were submitted on Wednesday .
a blow may also apply to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Tuesday evening , who also gave the indication and carried out the investigations into the site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been announced on Sunday morning after having arrived home on Sunday after visiting a fall in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen coming back home on Sunday .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators appeared at first on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
for some question@@ ings in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing ones , a crime was conceived against the 20 @-@ year old .
the alleged off@@ ender introduced the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the detain@@ ee , authorities reportedly killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police interro@@ gation and glue them into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be pen@@ it@@ ant at the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday . the investig@@ ators call him to load .
close to the circumstances of the act , the further investigation are to be carried out .
refugees need accommodations : study warned about apartment @-@ flags
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is a challenge in front of a challenge .
the distribution efforts on the German housing market have long been started .
with the coming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more people will rush on a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with a weak citizens for the last paid apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , a study on behalf of the association of social housing &quot; Social Hou@@ ses &quot; was completed .
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live for asylum seek@@ ers in a first night accommodation .
many will stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the ten@@ ants .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were found in the last year .
however , the negative development of the stock market should not only be in the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant reduction in inventory policy of recent years .
Germany turns a housing @-@ deficit before it becomes bigger from year to year .
at present , approximately 77@@ ,000 units were missing in metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study involved .
many professionals still lived in major cities in major WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed because of the slow@@ down on the housing market un@@ voluntarily even in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the cities , the number of square meters per capita has fallen back for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Hou@@ sing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
at the same time , new inc@@ enti@@ ves will boost the social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved on the purchase tax , and the property tax is initially allocated for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
in addition , the Alliance attractive tax @-@ free depreciation is necessary .
the funding programme for the refugee income of the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W resi@@ sts very well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with € 184 million more than half of the available approx . 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia are hall@@ way a corridor .
although Hungary is virtually no more water @-@ growing , there is always more refugees to choose the way of Croatia .
Zagreb announces that to grant travel through Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree on Slovenia with the neighboring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slov@@ ene interior minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ jic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen Area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country yet .
after the evacu@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived in Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RTL radio .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees at the beginning of the day .
new laws that entered into force on the same day make an adequate asylum procedures in Hungary to be practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police launched the first refugees to the border of Serbia on Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to the media reports , most originated from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and with a taxi in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to reach on foot about the green border to Croatia .
the refugees encounter the Croatian border at the Croatian border - not on the f@@ ences .
it divi@@ des other dangers : there are still sharp mines there from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
he will now create a safe passage immediately .
after the closure of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police wound up 3@@ 66 people .
in front of the circuit on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws set the over@@ coming and damage to the limit as an offen@@ se .
in the southern Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were instit@@ uted .
the defendants thre@@ aten to judge sentences of up to five years and the deportation of the country .
according to the immigration authority , we have made a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday and almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicant , 13 families with young children , as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees too .
practically , however , nobody has granted a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
in a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe party . &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
prior to the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to tie down .
they collected the gar@@ bage in which tens of thousands of people left behind the road@@ side in the past weeks .
lock gr@@ ille have been dismant@@ led and rebuilt any of the recording facility in the land@@ line .
no one would want to express itself to the target of this structure .
Austria has just reached a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
around 20,000 emig@@ rants still remained in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German authorities &apos; assignment .
open in overhead travelling , smaller groups of immigrants came on foot .
Mayor was elected &quot; Sh@@ ran@@ som@@ ed &quot; over the border
&quot; we worked after the bridge on Sunday with the premises when suddenly there were ten people with Reis@@ ek@@ off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor of Alois Kra@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had unexpected the rail traffic on Sunday in Austria because of the refugee camp , it was the city of W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; who immediately offered his assistance and the stran@@ ded together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars crossed the border into the vicinity of the near Pass@@ au .
before we had har@@ n@@ essed the intact guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a course for us of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city council in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it , a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we really enjoyed it , &quot; says town .
the pulling train arrived in Wels on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE dive in front of Pass@@ au , where the railway traffic was stopped after Germany &apos;s announcement that the rail traffic was stopped according to Germany .
the Regional Court was completed at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly linked to the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before a double bridge , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends for another hundreds of thousands , is a logical result of a apparent ir@@ ite policy :
rather than to help applying structures in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures guarant@@ e@@ eing human@@ ities , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has advanced up and publicly re@@ decorated the position of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ime of National Soci@@ alism .
sorry for this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions at the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ge@@ ck@@ lings have to tell that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they have been invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a major challenge , given the constant stream of refugees and the close quarters , creating decent conditions for seek@@ ers .
and there will be another bigger one - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 new tents
Konrad has full of hands to do with the refugee organization .
Christian Konrad : it is meant that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up a quarters for tens of thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the premiere centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already begun to get a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in tra@@ il@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is without great host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad Adenauer credits an event of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the hot year .
over the coming weeks , 35,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the capit@@ als .
they would have promised him to create qu@@ arti@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess yet , even to the coming refugees .
&apos;@@ in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and should be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations presents the asylum coordinates also in the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ping &quot; as we . &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer unlimited accommodations .
in addition , you &apos;re hoping to go empty in the winter season .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critici@@ zed the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in terms of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to comply with a certain amount of thum@@ b @-@ holders or a size of the guard .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency standards &quot; have to apply .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , with the fact that it was successful , Konrad creates with his experience .
I am an old gentle@@ man , whom we don &apos;t say without further into the face of truth .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause the Republic to do any cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees will want to increase them to three to four .
the own arti@@ fici@@ ent search wasn &apos;t yet successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container on st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better partition
currently , no opening of urban sports and other buildings as tips @-@ Arena and design centers for lodging of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
the mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) is currently not necessary for those who can be accommodated at the moment without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , further locations are to be inspected for use in the emergency .
criticism , the managing director of the division of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
sea of@@ er : &quot; borders are not inter@@ locked &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ens@@ inger ( VP ) acquitted on Monday the further procedure in the refugee question .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not to be locked .
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic may continue to be possible .
however , the corresponding border controls are now in place .
in the moment , special trains with refugees to Germany won &apos;t be any more .
however , the prot@@ ector has been brought to Germany with regular journeys .
in the other EU member states , the applicant has gathered more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
it is now that Austria will again introduce its limits to its limits , &quot; shall resolve to &quot; a logical result , &quot; from the advance of the Germans .
the next run@@ ta@@ stic is a question of time
the reconstruction of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industrial Bar is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T moved in , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be rented for young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T - chief of Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard , and later also which is to be acquired .
starting from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises much : &quot; the next run@@ ta@@ stic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the tech@@ c@@ En@@ ter , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz to the country Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as tech@@ c@@ En@@ ter .
30 percent of 2700 square metres of 2700 square metres remaining in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in center of the center .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to temporarily halt the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the exchange market @-@ ar@@ cade : finally , she received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop over the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything spins for women &apos;s hand@@ bags in the fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting at 75 euros .
bigger pockets and accessories cost up to € 500 .
since yesterday , the new shop is in operation .
it has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but for a long time I thought about it to open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a separate site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold were done .
&quot; we are the only in the great region of Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots .
their fashion interests has been given to the cra@@ dle of their mother into the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something is developing and I can show new trends for high @-@ performance prizes .
why some women don &apos;t want to use a nice hand@@ bag in tran@@ ce , also the house@@ wife can &apos;t answer the last safety .
maybe it is , that a beautiful bag of each out@@ fit has been upgraded .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village called investors .
this property will also be connected to the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he is interested in strange @-@ enemy , journalists Rü@@ de , or knowledge g@@ aps in the crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidency was ag@@ gra@@ vely in the campaign for the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the el@@ pe@@ zo@@ ological K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate are descended .
the New Yorker with the bo@@ oming appears to many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
for the 1200 inhabitants there is some big corners related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in combat phase mode .
the law of Simone Wen@@ del rot@@ ated a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers then think about its goal , become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s something exciting , but that &apos;s not deeply impressed with its kind of cow , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ish , native to an am@@ using documentary on the site and his offspring of spro@@ uts , has also directed the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz in addition to Tr@@ ump .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for blin@@ dness , comes also in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also at word - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ ish .
he did not bring it to the heart of the hearts .
although they pret@@ end respect to the performance of the family , but even tenden@@ cies tend to say that &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; is a little bit la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dently the no@@ isy of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ ish within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in German : the gi@@ ver , says it .
therefore , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of investors .
the success story of this success story began in 1885 when the father of grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for the dig@@ gers in the United States .
foundation stone of the property group were initial land purchases in New York .
however , the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tra@@ gi@@ cs : her desire to return to the home , in the Bavarian state , belonged to the Pfalz at that time .
he has not accepted Tr@@ ump , because he had once been finished without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ one @-@ European history and folk music , Roland Paul , explained to the film release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration &quot; .
this stands in contrast to the mit@@ ek markings of the night .
he had repeatedly said about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border area to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ lin@@ ated , this is not so fascinating , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a further relationship tro@@ ut ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born @-@ old Heinz &quot; ) .
the wine gro@@ wer in retired sees the Americans rather dist@@ ressed , &quot; he is always so aw@@ ful . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never looked after a town . &quot;
the nam@@ es@@ os Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned as many as many k@@ g@@ ites , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church organ , which came generally well in general .
&quot; I could not imagine that by Donald House , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they &apos;re better if he didn &apos;t hurt the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had the plagues at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ os Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe again without the pre@@ f@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the neighboring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for the awarding of the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have been un@@ mistak@@ able , who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s .
the woman , at which Sam Wood arrives in The bach@@ elor &apos;s house , was covered by the largest secret location .
and none of the three left girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we came to check@@ ers with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before they checked , you might have acci@@ dentally put a reference to who will be the winner .
Sam : holding his lips until the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have left their ly@@ rical arrangement , why Wood is the perfect man and gave his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked , &quot; If you , who was able to receive Woods Last Rose ? &quot; could their answers be given to the epic level , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s life .
every year , Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went into the home and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ u@@ energies noted , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I meant it all over the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing with both feet in the ground , giving it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the return visit became clear to her that Wood &quot; could be Wood . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , I realized that this was not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ bi@@ ased for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , wh@@ om@@ soever you should choose , when it wasn &apos;t she , then she was av@@ eng@@ ed .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell you , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equal - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that were sent after his impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the Bank , when he lost a rum@@ ble as it lost the Aussie Millions Guaranteed final during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday during the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula commissioned his husband and put Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula further showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of being ro@@ ok@@ ies before the remainder of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ journalist Cam See also told that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by the specialist teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ted f@@ ang and to worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne was reconstructed in a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start to set up the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian trade union for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the bub@@ ble and subsequently told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 that he could imagine no worse starting to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that comes before you take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne was able to shar@@ pen the he@@ aters with his original debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area resulted in a T@@ ry for Queensland .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters are calling for the high refugee numbers the assembly of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and fra@@ ction@@ ation Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn @-@ sur @-@ Year in a major crisis at Bay@@ erns &apos;s Scho@@ ols , if there are many new students not according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get inspec@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Sunday @-@ section of the Free elec@@ tors will take place until Friday in the underground Commune .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of applied for the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of the UN patron zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the early 1990s during the early 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes not further , we have to regard the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous asylum seek@@ ers want to withdraw the Free voters as soon as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative court responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum applications , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the FW expert is critici@@ zed by the fact that several German states are not to be consistently : &quot; we would need to be a uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria reg@@ ases it , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become action @-@ capable . &quot;

for the new school year , Pierre Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot study &quot; Mid @-@ stage plus &quot; with an extension of secondary high @-@ grade development of three to four years - in the result it then takes nine years to high school .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; the theme G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all the high school students .

4 People were killed , after police officers on rubber on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal .
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police arrested rubber shells in a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on the evening evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Apostle officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and inc@@ endi@@ ary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot in the air before she turned back on rubber @-@ wagons .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t clear why the rubber cord , of which are known to be killed , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently there is such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of non @-@ violent protests in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution to cut political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that they wish to have their own country .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been violent alter@@ c@@ ations since the 10th century .
in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal whose centuries was centrally governed .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake which led thousands of people in April .
this week , the legisl@@ ator has agreed on certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

the project has lasted ten to twelve million euros in the discussion since months .
strong responses under se@@ bu@@ ds owners who have come to the meeting , the pictures and new details called for the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Sea bu@@ y@@ holder and manager of the Member of the Ab@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter , that prot@@ ru@@ des all other prayer . &quot;
in addition , he feared as some other project critics that the traffic should be stronger by the deliber@@ ate size of the plant : &quot; the whole bus charges don &apos;t have to come to which this &quot; Schulz said , &quot; Schulz said :
although exactly on the good one hectare large area of the former inn is happening , it is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a complete concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger .
because this was missing , the development plans will also be variable .

Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign which will help about $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , who will help thousands of refugees that cover the European nations because they come from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donations called on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google team who has fled to her family of Kabul , wrote her personal experience with her family experience seven years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and angu@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people are looking des@@ per@@ ately seeking my family .
donations are sent to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million goo@@ gle@@ .com / year will be doubled to 11 million $ .

for easy di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery are longer than those who receive not surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death rate data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on weight loss surgery that wrote a leading article to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss , surgery , or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to nour@@ ish food .
more than the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in treatment of type 2 diabetes as well , but most studies have been undertaken with people whose disease is ob@@ ese with a Body measure index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , who have been collected in a study since 2007 , compare with two types of obesity and stomach training - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI of those who undergo this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who non @-@ surgical type treatments have received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who subjected themselves to a surgical procedure , with 36 % of the diabetes is completely dissolved and 28 % partially diagnosed .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ medi@@ cally @-@ medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , it dis@@ sol@@ ves only by one percent and sometimes only about two percent .
in addition , the results were published in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL @-@ Ch@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors came out .
the researchers also woke up the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is supposed to be the best below 7 per cent , the researchers have registered .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 per cent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , in a BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ h@@ um of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study involved in Sweden causing an operation to a longer lifetime , says Black@@ stone , University of Arizona , College of Medicine .
in the Swedish study , it was associated with ob@@ ese people who subjected to an Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said , it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone stipul@@ ates that humans and their physicians should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , associated with obesity and diabetes , it is really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently receiving attention in the fiction : a young woman , at school times , un@@ popular and in@@ vigor@@ ously , meets after years the flock of their youth , and this fell in love with them .
&quot; in the recently released novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not as &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the story of love , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ be@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding settlements .
the full vocational author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and rejo@@ ices that she was able to place a literary monument to her home .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone to join Europe is &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added to the fact that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist Tibetan leaders called for to end the violence in the domestic countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he ordered that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be provided for the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he was also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , though the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama established in Germany and Austria efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful , but in the meantime you must re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , as a real peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; said he .
finally , we have to think about how the kill@@ ings are reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action following the September 11 terrorist attack and revealed that the violent reaction of the US pulled out a chain of un@@ control@@ able events after himself .
after September 11 , I moved my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush &apos;s letter , and I told him that the way to the solution of this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he put on violence , and this was caused by unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of income infections through children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA will report on an almost 400 percent increase in children under twelve years of age , which have strongly refra@@ ct@@ ory infectious agents such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common in these products and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the listing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants tend to be si@@ ze@@ able while some do it to im@@ press their friends or for a mutation in social media .
show videos on YouTube , such as youths disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants tend to drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents reported disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic wash water to obtain a harder beverage .
the younger children can be ho@@ cked by attractive plugs for disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants ) are the ones that are ready @-@ added .
there are disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange chi@@ lies , which are very respon@@ sive to children .
trailer disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few injec@@ tions lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially with small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ist centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you don &apos;t have crushed a whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ec@@ tant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year @-@ old girl who recently captured four d@@ ashes of straw@@ berry dual suspension at school in the school , was brought to a not@@ ing of emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is legally considered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ s up her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the draw .
doctors passed over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed down the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ affir@@ s &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants and to store suspension rights outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ec@@ t@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ low of ham@@ let infections which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of Health Author@@ ities susp@@ ect that the product contained GM , a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ alkoh@@ ol , who became active as an active ingredient .
in January , three students enrolled in the fourth class in the state of New York to conv@@ ene their &quot; c@@ eption &quot; teaching associated with anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; then a police report reports .
the teacher is highly allergic to Han@@ de@@ des@@ ec@@ tant and allied them from their room .
the police looked at the aud@@ iting plan as &quot; Gesch@@ ker@@ tz , &quot; and shew@@ ed inter@@ disciplinary action to the school authorities .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

there is rum@@ ours of dis @-@ related to Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ ane@@ ously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control as they prepare for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch table guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bi@@ d@@ ited defe@@ ats - de Bo@@ er
former army @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch national football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , since there &apos;s no title of title by the ranking .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the ranking .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they are talking about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m game , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars by D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepts that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian chief sw@@ ans to turn the things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdraw@@ als from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , which now stands out with five points head clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had previously poor days , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need the support from Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing up now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously in January transfers
in spite of his comments before only a few weeks ago , that he stated that he would viol@@ ate a few January transfers , the Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful in the signing of new arrivals and insi@@ sted that he didn &apos;t want to inter@@ fere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ transfer of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
the players coming in summer have this pre @-@ season time to in@@ corporate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more harm is done by allowing unnecessary players to add to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew , who won anything , playing poker in cup or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t have won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it grows in the United Kingdom overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom ended as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent higher than that of the UK@@ s from 5.5 per cent as the figures for National Stati@@ stical ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland to 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ally commented the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has taken the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for the late legal intervention , I will see how a man becomes a death .
when it happens and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the gi@@ ft@@ injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January of its best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day drew near , I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
a unique perspective would offer .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are more applications available as places available , there will be a spot@@ less lottery jackpot , in order to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who will be selected , the bi@@ ke@@ en will be observed .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to sit in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of my closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the couple of months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to me to draw a not@@ ebook and a pin to draw what I see .
I need to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , accused me of charge on Twitter to abandon my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she spati@@ ally admitted that they could be able to form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even though he would do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants to be present an international journalist to write there .
when he dies , he thinks the public@@ ity work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
when you want to know more about the case , please hear the po@@ d@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can not say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary .
but I think that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of hom@@ icide .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim , really objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn on to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man to mo@@ ist police tra@@ its hunt talking to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth , to leave the police , was un@@ successful when he was located in shallow and sum@@ p@@ ical waters , a few metres from a police officer , which was trying to persu@@ ade him to go back to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a home peace break @-@ incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape from them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not go too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water @-@ house and said &apos; I &apos;m not out , come and get me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable salmon Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform n@@ ass , therefore he turned a more reliable tac@@ tics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny stuff to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to attack him and threatened to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he headed to the ste@@ wards and the aims department of Racing Victoria and held that it maintained a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy , on Fair@@ fax Media , he always tried to do what is best for the racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it went around the positive cob@@ alt @-@ listening test in Li@@ dar@@ is he cannot explain .
he had kept his complaints 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and did not want to see it , &quot; looking like the dro@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have eaten it long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything happens at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you will react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with them what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the main race , and I want to think that my owners would do my best for them .
if they start to think I do not doing it , then I should no longer be train@@ ee .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , Moo@@ dy had tried in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating the support department had tried to cut out his barn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before eighteen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - whom I will name , if I wanted to do a job in my st@@ ables , to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy &apos;s Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they certainly could touch their n@@ oses , because they try to hold me , in the attempt to uph@@ old me .
Robert Roul@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that time and are still today .
should I bring that to the mind that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L cra@@ ve out , and maybe people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think outside that I am .
perhaps they will have taken away my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say to her now about thinking about it .
but I am now at the point that it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them , and push it out to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching has led to him that he could throw up his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the Un@@ known Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ treatment principle &quot; ri@@ di@@ culous , &quot; having been applied to a package of mud or sound on the horse deb@@ ated , which was stored against the Rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must assume responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees was deposited sli@@ ps on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday in the whole day , which was such a thing .
but it had also that day on the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an inquiry into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do nothing know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Hotel Bell@@ amy proposes things to fight against cav@@ ities due to ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has given review on the Tac@@ al in his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League with the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators tent@@ atively allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring strug@@ gles with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co trainer Wayne Bennett was riding a note to the Storm team , after winning his team the final victory against North Queensland C@@ ow@@ sat on Saturday night . he named the game a &quot; para@@ dig@@ m game &quot; and said that the two from Queensland should not be too good at the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ e@@ ering of his crew , and said that they have been concentr@@ ating on &quot; contact &quot; in tac@@ kling his &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criti@@ que of two leading co@@ aches in his crew makes it confident , as it means nothing concerns about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it won &apos;t be up again - I heard not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring strug@@ gles to fight as they gave us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques in the past year , but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real estate , and this has been our trend for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not getting used to lose , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it &apos;s funny , as it appears again during this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and a ment@@ or to remind that the premi@@ er St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he gave his match on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and that we can watch as exciting , in particular its young players at their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you like to play when you have this type of gam@@ bl@@ ers .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play .
I build more confidence because they &apos;re saying these things because they are a bit worried , against which to play against us .
they didn &apos;t think about six weeks ago when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters recorded a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against the boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and don &apos;t have any points to wav@@ er ?
there are the plans for me .
if we mention us , it means that we will still meet in phase 1 .
the Storm @-@ Team has no effect on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland C@@ ow@@ sat or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from the next day of service tomorrow .
Serbia with $ 200,000 Guaranteed for drugs
a man , who may have a lifetime fine due to his experiment , to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine which , after Queensland , was released against a damages of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was ob@@ serving how he arrived his Mit@@ t Harbour in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
in spite of a potentially life penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ vi@@ c , he argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the Café , it could have been a harm@@ less reason .
on foot on the leader of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the floods of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; declared the Court on Wednesday .
in case of absence , he weighed the police over his position .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the detailed explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter f@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from it , he warned him .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on a deposit , in terms of conditions that he reports to his Australian and Serbian pass , when police reports daily and keeps on a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract a ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a teacher , he used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl in order to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g received the maiden when she slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a series of un@@ appealing pictures of children which were sent to him from another user .
the girl finally woke up and found the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , analysed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered the section &quot; Web search &quot; for search of un@@ touched images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g said to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then presented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a polic@@ eman to be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attor@@ ney at o@@ li@@ dh Robertson said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he would be ad@@ di@@ cted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searches were done on the computer at him , but he said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten the oph@@ ile .
after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked them to send more photos .
he said he did so to temp@@ t them .
he said he is sick in his head when he drinks , and said he will see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson said , &quot; when the maid found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was on the trem@@ ors , and on the crying .
she then saw the well @-@ standing pictures on the phone and did con@@ front the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked after a lot younger than he was .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty according to the indictment , in@@ consistent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and on 25 January of this year issued against the insurrection and did not appear before the court appearance on 24 March of this year .
Secretary Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because one could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; can be found in his embar@@ rass@@ ment .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postponed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case but was kept in provisional detention due to hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was still admitted before the date of decision to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .

Stuttgart : emerging from the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the South West
meteor@@ ologist war@@ nings against cock@@ tails in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a deep pressure area throughout Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong thunder@@ storm is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who are drag@@ ged over the Atlantic offshore islands last days . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Friday , they want to look into the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
in 2015 , it is especially moving in compact cars that are currently especially well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public stage September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
this year , a lot of new compact cars will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be standing at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume model also sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive for this .
Opel is launching a entry below the biggest VW Golf in Vie@@ ws , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra range from EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ essi@@ ans are also provided for further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the petrol engine also feature three cylinder gasoline engines .
other than the most important compet@@ itor Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus gives the Opel Astra at first just as a fifth .
the second variant , will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be done next to the Astra at the IAA or new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of his Astra competition Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ cylinder in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
he arrives in the trade at the start of the next year , and then also a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : the brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ sho@@ ots wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
yet the compact Infin@@ iti with his curved lines fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) for production .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the model DS 4 compact class model that is shown at the IAA .
in particular , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front section : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system is moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons provided by a touch screen and is now integrated using Apple &apos;s Car@@ play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there is a number of over@@ working and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Department of Justice of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell in a small cell .
because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision made on Wednesday .
the person concerned may even wait for money if they were locked in confin@@ ement for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe : it was housed in the prison complex of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , in a single cell , measuring some five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated .
afterwards the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , has now been on free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his official arrest warrant would fail because of the in@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions against the country of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Berlin chamber of Berlin and rejected the case there again .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides about the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons from the fra@@ grant period only a few days of hard days for the compensation are decisive , it was given a compensation sentence .
otherwise , &quot; a reduction of the legal protection of the personality is to be feared . &quot;
the chamber of the chamber must now clear the height of the dent@@ ured .
in the past , the Constitu@@ ters have often increased the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
so they said : in April , they said that men were imprisoned in prison , because he was naked in prison .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 that also increases the multi@@ occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , in addition to this , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had a parall@@ eled accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ ance event in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff took place over three months , from 15 to 21 hours a day , such as the Karlsruhe cell .
the Berlin prison pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines in recent weeks , too .
detain@@ ees should therefore be shut down again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness to blows itself , it should have already become brut@@ ish because of the ten@@ sion@@ ed situation .
according to the judicial cler@@ ks , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of up @-@ to @-@ death cases , 19 are supposed to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to assume it .
what to go to Germany ?
roughly 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Culture this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in light of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : &quot; we can do it and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
according to various projec@@ tions between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( the estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) are apartments every year - for the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as we have been built ( 250@@ 000 houses ) .
the lack of living space was dramatic but above all for affordable rental objects : annually , between 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments from the rental in rent , and to apply for these particularly favourable dwellings .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwellings are expected every year and therefore the federal government would have to invest a considerable increase of 6.4 billion per year .
in fact , scientists and Federal Minister of Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in the housing .
according to the Institute for Employment Research and Professional research , 55 per cent of those in Germany can be eligible for employment in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not systematically asked for their qualification to help them with the entry , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key of social contacts for the appreciation of the admission group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , mig@@ r@@ ations researcher Dietrich Au@@ än@@ hardt says .
in Germany , according to the Federal Government , there has been a political turn : the Ministry of Labour for Refu@@ ge@@ es for recognition of labour .
while there was a for@@ bade of asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ess , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
it has also been in society because of the highly skilled and predomin@@ ance - the majority of the visible in the field that refugees should be able to increase the access to the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
up to now , there is no special offer in general and joint @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most frequently con@@ veys due to personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view from the Throne of the Queen , to the labour re@@ integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give her children to the Kit@@ assic world , an estimated 10 to 15 percent . &quot; it is only once again important to maintain the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Cos@@ chem@@ y , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
however , in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration of manuscri@@ pts are distributed in different languages .
if the need to educ@@ ators strongly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of the occup@@ ant - about by increasing more technical colle@@ ges .
students without German language skills will be prepared in classes in the countries .
they are not always taught by skilled teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says the suit@@ case from the school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany do not want to study .
basically , no state asylum seek@@ ers or crowd reported the study - the only exception was to so far been Berlin , Ex@@ c@@ ator Frank handle ( CD@@ U ) , however , abandoned its attitude towards now .
student con@@ sent@@ ers could be reli@@ eved from access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or Dul@@ ce do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er Act when they start studying .
the latter represent no volumes in principle , as they do not fall under the circle of appropri@@ ation .
Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees had to have lived four years ago in Germany to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as of January 1 , 2016 , this span was shortened to 15 months .
but the funding gap must be closed , however , Steffen Schröder , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get bite @-@ pieces .
Islam will in future play a major role as many refugees are Muslims , and many of them are the religion of important identity .
the state should gradually introduce the same rights as they have the churches , and developing the existing state @-@ churches rights to a new state of religions .
it would also be important to the establishment of a islam@@ ic prosperity which profession@@ ally takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
these rights also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree to some and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to use certain control facilities .
to this end , there is also a read@@ iness to go to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism too .
the chairman of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed the wor@@ ries of wor@@ ries , religious conflicts can also be carried into Germany as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who sought to kill such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration is much more likely to be a topic of the whole society in future .
in order to change majority society , the mining of discrimination and rac@@ ism is constra@@ ined .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination clause and an General Equality Act for the past decade .
but it gets very slow , like the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship , pointing to the police and authorities to systematically explo@@ it the rac@@ ist theme .
the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are already demanding and why international agreements are expected to become reality in the coming years , when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should uti@@ lize their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical support for the expected refugees , the president of Germany , Frank , Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities concerned , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he to the daily mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , we have to flow more money into the system .
to avoid the risks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for suspension elements at the same time as to register health cards .
services could be attributed to the federal states later .
and in the long term , it was highly frag@@ mented , so many people with limited power to view the asylum seek@@ ance Act .
otherwise , the doctors make the things ready to create language barriers .
by now , the health scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated thus far , migrants are resolved am@@ aged over their disease than other patients .
Dol@@ met@@ sch@@ ists must not only be accepted in hospitals , even in health practices , calls for them .
many of refugees have been helped , however , already with more general medical events in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic eyes .
among young refugees , there are clearly more un@@ treated people , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
but with the partly different clinical pictures , German doctors headed by their education but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; paras@@ ite cases or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as regards the doctors , it is in sight by the refugees even in sight .
the Syrians were a highly developed educational system , but few refugees were even doctors .
in order to be practi@@ cing , they would have to prove their qualification and they may look bl@@ ur@@ red again .
at least half of the refugees coming into Germany is attributable to the Bund@@ esp@@ sycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) mental ill : most patients suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress interfer@@ ing or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are especially vulnerable to refugee kids .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich , Germany prove that , every fifth Syrian refugees in Germany traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from one post @-@ trau@@ matic stress interfer@@ ing is suffering from , among other things , to so @-@ called Flash@@ back with air@@ need , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart r@@ ens and the Con@@ fi@@ sts .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration , strong terr@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to avoid that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , a early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick people receive a p@@ sycho@@ therapy .
indeed , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for p@@ sycho@@ therapy for a p@@ sycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
moreover , in the social affairs , there are mostly property developers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to day@@ dream

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current clock setting .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for a@@ am@@ a@@ ze is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to another world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lines the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ age &apos;s cocktail with a world city of fla@@ ir , &quot; said director Reinhard Pro@@ bst in his concept .
you can now experience 50 cities on the almost 3 &quot; 000 km long tour .
the Circus Festival is convinced by the talented artists from around the world .
winning at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family re@@ tre@@ ats the audience with joke and charm in their spell .
also the Cast@@ illo Brothers also understand their hand@@ craft .

60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ uses in the attitude of circul@@ ating are just an important topic in various animal rights organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst will also say : &quot; it is not good for our animals , we aren &apos;t doing well . &quot;
every string unit is approximately 80 animals from five different continents .
the four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from the eyes according to the possibility of every desire .
we work together with the animals and have fun with them .
if the beast doesn &apos;t feel good , it doesn &apos;t want it in the c@@ ages .
the upper Command@@ ment thus : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id j@@ um@@ bo , a mixture of a shop of shop and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ ds , the family Pro@@ bst are proud .
the two animals lived in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small j@@ um@@ bo came , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the lovers , but this is the unique blend of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and perfect with our whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ it Robert Mu@@ gabe is holding a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , climbed down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout the social media .
the opening of the Assembly was also reflected in a statement by M@@ EPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death thre@@ ats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had blown up him and interrupted his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese stated that seven opposition politician received a SMS messages on their cell phones that they war@@ n to distur@@ b them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message is of a number that is not shown but it has given the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ cha . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they war@@ ns the Members of Parliament that the unity of Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
the boss , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; worried about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is able to build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and to separate business activities .
the expected job construction results in a burden from over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Committee , which is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused when it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support businesses in a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company we are better positioned and ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual sales and &quot; is focused on providing un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , which has Palo Alto garage , &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring , to manage the return of traditional PCs on mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US Tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that a tight @-@ focused company focused a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates will have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb in the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his role in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate b@@ ang injury , and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injuries not threatened not the carrier , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone , who doesn &apos;t heal well .
it is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with its Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as well recognized as W@@ enger , there is the associated danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a very pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries declined 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 League players in the last five times .
the wider image for Arsenal is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League performers were able to list the most significant contributions .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last throughout the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ pen@@ sive period , a time in which you need to strengthen and win your body and win , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of nature , which he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham &apos;s next Wednesday , and W@@ enger will present themselves a press within the team .
h@@ é@@ ra Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not widely travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
W@@ enger can also start Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d rather than by Mon@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and to give the players it need , a little bre@@ ather break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal reached clear favour@@ ites at Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest turn@@ around in Europe with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening and was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ senal was withdrawn from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am quite enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that grants us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is apparent , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now is more des@@ perate than ever before , to prove a suicide rate among young men on a 15 @-@ year high@@ s .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ pas@@ ch ( C@@ ures - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a her@@ ent life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking culture into question the men seek to seek assistance if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms revealed that when the tor@@ ial has had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; has doubled its chances for recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only , that friendship may work for friendship .
in the age of communication on social media , communication with their focus on style , the in@@ medi@@ ation of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though the isolation is dominated in reality .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what Psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values indicate ; money , image , social status , all at costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - Our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which acts much deeper into our spiritual health .
and as a video game inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but through his personality that shines through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football @-@ looking at a comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross in Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely stay in any case even if they are often back to explore completely their feelings .
as a staff of the telephone past@@ oral care he told me : ... &quot; my reas@@ oning for people who are de@@ pressed these de@@ pressed and op@@ ar@@ ating it , clearly showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us will often not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term stability mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as very my objective gu@@ it@@ ari@@ i status via phone the person in sight of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenes , why do you not take your friends to drink at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can see someone in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give it a smile and tell him hello .
you never know which difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to comedy Central from the beginning until the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria , to help PS@@ G to pieces Malmö ,
Angel Di Resta celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and dar@@ son Cav@@ allo for his hit against Malmö .
di Maria , in his debut in the Champions League , meets on Tuesday and PS@@ G to pass over to Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Resta and Edinburgh announced the course that Paris Saint @-@ Germain had its Champions League Cup season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory on Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Mary met in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards it missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their advantage as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ ag@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , since it is not only for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while playing the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later was later in play against his home town team and against the club where he started his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win your opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his violation in any of three changes to the Paris team that last weekend became a 2 : 2 tie in his own place for Bordeaux in the First League , but he was discharged in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an altar was referred to as the man on the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month by Manchester United , and he demonstrated why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass , behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off proposed to accomplish this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and was flo@@ ated with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field flo@@ ated to a serious opponent .
but out of an oath by Nikola D@@ jur@@ ors , who goes far to Kevin Tra@@ ction P@@ fo@@ s in the 3@@ 4th minute , they b@@ agu@@ ed little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G herself was found , with some patches and mis@@ ses , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who was not least patented during the first half of attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had employed him after re@@ start .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players to the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned the Di Mary into a spin , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ s ...
the second gate was last dropped shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus scored his sixth seasonal gate , after Jer@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had he@@ wed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game , and just an excellent approach from Wil@@ and from quick distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before the replacement of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi got a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age of Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class of his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented my move to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern stood shortly before a few years ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion champion winner , two times champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca fair X@@ avi now therefore , he was already standing at the time before the EM in 2008 .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça are buying me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid has then won everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern too .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a quote from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ os didn &apos;t want to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann managed the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi left not .
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the german record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça called Gu@@ ardi@@ ola on contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not change that he could not present himself the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of movies here
Matt Dam@@ on faced the af@@ ru@@ @-@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced A@@ ctor Brown &quot; highlighted the need of alternative perspectives and thereby empha@@ sized in regards to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about variety , then you &apos;ll do it in the cast of the movie and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian emerged .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of producer Ben @-@ aff@@ s , and the Far@@ m@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of the harmony &quot; said Brown initially .
the only black person is , and it is a sp@@ line which will be beaten by their white vend@@ or .
the producer of De@@ er White People were set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directed rights in the film ; D@@ one responded that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the Social Media will explo@@ ded on Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments on women &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his rage through the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can declare her variety - that is SO W@@ ISS that it &apos;s hurt . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served over 5,000 re@@ ins and 4,000 le@@ kes for its publication since its release .
women comments arrive at a time at the exact ra@@ cial representation of the media at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved Higher Education and urged @-@ makers and authorities to enjo@@ ing discrimination against color content .
in February , the singer Prince took a recording on the movement , during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; st@@ out sil@@ ently , &quot; ( albums have still their mean@@ ings ) , he said .
as books and black life , albums are still their importance .
in younger time , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter made a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group was to be considered as an hate @-@ group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love band , &quot; said the leaders .

just as suddenly .. I can imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood journalist to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , even though he finished the course at all , did not finish any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .

Detroit Tig@@ ers P@@ ing on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ W L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in former times , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers will be on the last square in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but they played this part perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the winner supports a chance for ascending with Houston Astro@@ s &apos;s second @-@ league game @-@ card for the second American League .
for Detroit , even if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to hold about a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad En@@ mus .
the tiger @-@ P@@ it@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon stopped his early offensive support when Detroit saw three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw out in the Bull@@ ring of each game , and therefore I really want to go into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two of us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game in Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had had four hits against the Seattle naval officer on July 6 .
&quot; he pushed the pot well , &quot; said sex .
it looked good from the ( tags : ) , looked far better from the Bull@@ ring , and he put it right into the game .
having three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh day , the player &apos;s victory had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton adapted the inning with a double in the left @-@ hand field .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks with a colorful , and Simon took his second Baz@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man whom he faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie H@@ ok@@ ie , Miguel S@@ ano , who decided to take a two run on the right @-@ handed shoot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ di .
with a pair of fla@@ p and the finish run at the second , Ver@@ di brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ps to a double play .
it was that in the Major League last 27 times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ps hit a double play
after Detroit to the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Detroit succeeded in making a R@@ BI double against the loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed fri@@ e however S@@ ano dates from three P@@ it@@ ches for his fifth gem@@ s .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tiger raised three R@@ uns on the first two inner @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an who had been shot in front of the game from the injuries of the list , after he had been missing more than one month due to a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt as I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pits in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the first Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave it a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z took in the game by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who managed to make a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succe@@ eds its 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the winners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Basque Nick Stein@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was eliminated from the game when he tried to get to the third place , which ended the threat .
the tiger placed in the second , obtained a One @-@ Out Double out of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t hurt especially well , but he has got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ Count , that did not affect any points in the third inning before being replaced by the Ret@@ ri@@ ever Re@@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ man .
by Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three guys for six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez retired due to injury of the saus@@ age .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed the shoulder from San@@ chez in 2007 .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and bright @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line is often more likely to fall from them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits nevertheless include : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ go mainly contain many of the vitamins A and its preliminary beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
for those who eat the crops , the muscles uti@@ lize the immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying Mang@@ os should not be too soft or w@@ reck@@ on and smell .

Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there &apos;s a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino in the presence of town Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christen@@ ed a popular place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill to the name of the German reform@@ ers .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies right in the centre of Rome , right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the fellowship of the Evangel@@ ical Church of the Evangel@@ ical Church in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in secret their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es over the centuries .
in a symbolic way , it become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) presented himself as a young August@@ ine mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he was feeling the city in that time when the fall into sin .
his negative impressions could be em@@ powered by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle .
in 1992 Luther had already introduced the division of the Li@@ von@@ ian Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt made for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ aja has been writing the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , which formul@@ ates his very personal interpre@@ tations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the particular issues , this can be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar elderly has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has taken a sub@@ jective selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that relate to issues like way of way , plagues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
thus , he has fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this is true to the Luther @-@ Verlag publishing company with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as to the Kettler @-@ Verlag publishing house with its focus on art @-@ books .
and there is , in particular , by the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites .
it is interpreted the Bible positions of Ot@@ mar &apos;s Old Bible and then translate into current merge . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible string of Martin Luther and each set of the artist , who sum@@ mon@@ ed his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord comes with golden rocks .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to double a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
it is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant powers of the Order .
&quot; on time the up@@ bringing was with the cane stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; remembers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to quit the people , perhaps to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help out art in high @-@ speed times : &quot; today perception of imag@@ ery is shaped by Advert@@ ise today and that &apos;s no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lic is ou@@ sted since .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images have always a little mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the observer in the pictures &quot; allow them to be affected , dis@@ covering and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for himself . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost went on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like to understand how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I am not respected to record the Bible completely , but most important for him , even mysterious say@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are about the pictures , the text explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans M@@ öh@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler by Luther @-@ Verlag is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
building project for BM@@ X railway starting
plans were made , company was asked to model the qu@@ il@@ isation for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X tram was finished .
the situation in politics and the administration were sor@@ row@@ ful for tra@@ iling , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permit .
the approval in October was won by the First Prize recipient of the Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , now in a child and youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said .
then it should be possible without &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied dedication for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga will be a clear sign throughout the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the p@@ lowing situation in Germany , and secu@@ res the policy of the following problems in violation of the following problems .
&quot; I keep it for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one tell no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone needs to be interested in getting this topic in the gr@@ asp , &quot; said DF@@ G Chef Wolfgang N@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensively enhance the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday of the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet with the Minister &apos;s Minister for Ö@@ zo@@ a and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a central part , &quot; he announced .
the football could also help and to help .
but the decisive moves must make politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation has ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; Kid@@ s@@ bach presented on the fr@@ inge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal agencies also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts set a clear signal , if on the left @-@ hand tri@@ cot , instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ption letter ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We are going to carry the &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be able to help everyone , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ Chef Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ ens@@ iti@@ vity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee &apos;s refugee goes to everyone , nobody can go away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can take part of the German states , no , we have to use our Radi@@ ation force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly even , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ide@@ &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
for the European Championship Quali@@ fications around Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Kid@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a great community factory in German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 licens@@ ors have started their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is in the football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of great importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will cooperate with the DF@@ G selection and the German government each 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported al @-@ bach .

Executive Vice President of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye through a down@@ fall in July .
following the accident on the steps of his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water of water , which he carried on the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eds , was rewarded with us and then tow@@ ed to the road - that told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager became involved with the meeting and was &quot; fully fit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thurs@@ days issue ) , which will come back to Germany in October and continue the software power@@ house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ ely usually work between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go with such a personal story to the public , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so something . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to go back if you &apos;re fallen . &quot;

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s finally broke out in the first group play of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the standings of the Bundesliga in the du@@ el with the P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 ) ( Sky ) .
&quot; we can not go back on it , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return of him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ranks at the R@@ EU@@ s position .

therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ ial is taking the place of du@@ ous art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; blessed the soccer teacher .

robots : government wants a leading position for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany is to be the process of technological adv@@ ancement .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in expanding the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile @-@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and connected ride will increase the traffic safety and provide for less stress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject , even with his counterpart , the G7 states , who come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the strategy setting of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rush of digital radio appearances .
for the testing of new technology currently a test stretch on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested .
as the driver , &quot; no additional liability risks will be en@@ forced , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; and needs to adapt to new developments . &quot;
by doing so , Germany wants to deplo@@ y about internationally , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars will be increased from 10 kilometers to 130 kilometers per hour .
moreover , the Federal Government also wants to use a amendment to the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as driver .
when automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver will become more and more a passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
however , driving vehicles on public roads are still expected to be expected by 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study &apos;s driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features at the location of Germany under@@ estimate the authors of the study by 2025 on some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital networking of pl@@ ws can result in more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transp@@ a@@ sible S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for fail@@ ures and the safety of the driver needs to be clearly explained clearly .
even the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still sk@@ ep@@ tic - much more than the French or Americans .
on the AA pre @-@ covered survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ A Institute in order to ass@@ ert that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be successful in the next decade , 32 percent did not believe it in 20 years , 31 percent does not believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respondents in Germany reach 33 percent by 2025 .
anyway , all drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ moving vehicle .
after an elevation of the digital bor@@ row , only seven percent would agree to provide control during the entire journey on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , traffic could be present at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , and 45 percent in traffic .
a good each v@@ ated would leave the car under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to repeat the title without Timo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blog also found a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing exchange at this time in China over the long term .

de@@ Gaulle feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite large fashion shows and a w@@ rist@@ watch Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which appear to be sc@@ ary for man thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry out the spectacular creation of the French designer , among others , that was put together with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits as a great star in the fashion scene - and therewith they were stuck into skirts .
&quot; I cannot tell today that I am the f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because i have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s been simple , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said de@@ jo@@ king .
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which will be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , is a good fortune to make a look over his person at the beginning .
it was actually on the other hand because : &quot; for me it was a little bit like death for me , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been held in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it concerns so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se of which hardly wrote to the present work of the man whose fashion history has ever been completed without ever having taken a training .
in chron@@ ology , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total of chore@@ ograph@@ ed , for which a lot of work was done : to decorate the pupp@@ ets , for example a styl@@ ist has been hired .
14 tons of material have changed the m@@ apped according to the c@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest@@ ation there was still a special treat . a leather p@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always was interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gaul@@ tiers old ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender ga@@ ze experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was clothed with his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , Gaul@@ tier said .
with a doll to play , his parents had not allowed him to him .
the dis@@ card of fashion he later taught himself later .
he st@@ ole steal fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show , he won &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to retain the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Sp@@ itz as fashion @-@ niche
in the past it went on the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around pl@@ th@@ o about , to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace created in large quantities for customers , who , for example , have worked in blan@@ kets and yar@@ d@@ ins .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Director of the Bo@@ fo@@ ster Pl@@ auen .
instead the mode is important again .
in the starting times of the pl@@ au@@ ener top fashion , fashion played a larger role , then pushed through the home industry and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt gives some examples : top of jewelry , with accessories such as pockets and for regional folk costumes .
general is the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which re@@ jects on past styles , an increasing customer potential .
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , we already make half of all orders .
box@@ ing Pl@@ w is joined together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Sp@@ ok@@ ies and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales were taken away .
there are almost no private stores and wholesale stores .
we hardly reach our products on this path in the way .
the mass goods are now far cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also , le@@ f@@ le of export , currently being exported to Russia and the United States .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we are environmentally friendly and soci@@ ally able to produce soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it also refers to the used materials . &quot;
thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berg regional office of the West@@ ern@@ berg School of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas in designers and factories that primarily think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design often only varies slightly , to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , fashion designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ alizes the historical snow @-@ ji@@ b brand .
in doing so , the machine st@@ ats small cu@@ ffs in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ gar Gold@@ schmi@@ ed in Bi@@ anca &apos;s H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ d were inspired : &quot; previously , I was able to do nothing with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the sn@@ ail peak for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , they domin@@ ates the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ge - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancest@@ ry have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and who wish to make a memory .
thus , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for the pl@@ au@@ ener .

XI D@@ ying to open the economy wider for the world

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors , and the consumers would create a significantly higher dose of the nerve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which has been a successful Working Pap@@ ers of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects failed , and with full impact of pregnant and young children , Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt was explained by F@@ ood@@ bank .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt was reported that the limits of nerve there are to be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already highly bur@@ dened with mercury , that on the basis of the still applicable limit values about 50 percent of the length will not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limits , only 14.5 percent would be in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to increase the limits of other fish at present 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , called the &quot; trick &quot; as little cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p &apos;s mostly bur@@ dened , so that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation during collapse is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ d@@ led se@@ wer system , which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal , which is particularly sensitive to the food @-@ chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts are of having &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ ual st@@ akes of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its homepage with regard to the applicable limit values , however , that a &quot; health threat of general population &quot; would not be expected .
mercury enters the environment through coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry to the Green Bundestag , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ corn ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in Pis@@ ces , Rhine and Danube can be &quot; durable and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March .
as a result of mercury in fish , Europe &apos;s most common health Ris@@ ks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF , in European countries .
