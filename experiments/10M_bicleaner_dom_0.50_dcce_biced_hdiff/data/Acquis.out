&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety measures after this agreement will end in relation to nuclear material , when the community and the organization is supposed to be diluted in a way that it is necessary for a nuclear activity which is under the face of securing measures , is no longer usable or practically non @-@ winning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community noti@@ fies the organisation according to the agreement made by core material from the states that is subject to securing measures for this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement will be termin@@ ated on core material as soon as the recipient state , as in this agreement , has taken over responsibility .
the organization leads documents , from which any passing , and , if necessary , the res@@ ume of securing measures will be caused on the further core material .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core material , which are subject to safegu@@ ards in this agreement , is to be used for non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacturing of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so the community with the organization of such a material , under which circumstances will be termin@@ ated on this material in relation to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
II ) That the material is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of securing measures after this agreement is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core bodies .
B ) The organization and community meet a regulation that the backup measures cannot be applied in this agreement as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these safety measures cannot be applied .
in any case , the backup measures are used again in this agreement as soon as the core material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held about the total volume and the composition of this material in the country or the concerned states and about any passing of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; but it extends only on affairs , as among other things , temporary and neg@@ ligent determin@@ ations of military activity , but does not relate to the military activity and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization , the community and the States contribute money to each of them carrying out their respective obligations due to their respective obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community , the States or persons , are subject to its sovereignty , but extraordinary costs following a special search for the organisation , so the organisation will be reim@@ bur@@ sed by this cost as it was stated in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , can be taken in accordance with their laws and other regulations , according to the organization and their officials for the purposes of implementing this agreement in the same way as on the state members of the states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any claim to claim the community or a state from the organization or a state of damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - claims resulting from implementing the securing measures to this agreement is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the Council of General Information , the Council has not been able to ensure that the organization has not been subject to check for nuclear weapons or other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ ed bodies , so he can proceed in accordance with Article X@@ II paragraph C of the stat@@ ute reports and may also take the relevant measures there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such steps , the Council , in which mass was achieved by the applied backup measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties have been affected - every representative opportunity to grant the necessary security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
upon request of the organization , community or state , consultations on questions take place , resulting from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States are entitled to ask that questions that are given out of the design or application of this agreement will be tested by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in discussion of such questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exception of disputes in accordance with Article 19 or one of the Council &apos;s counsel , disputes ar@@ ising from the interpretation or the application of this agreement will be set out on the request of a arbit@@ ral tribunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community and the States enter two arbit@@ rators , the organization also named two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbit@@ rar@@ er arbit@@ rators chose a fifth , which presi@@ ded the chair@@ manship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have the community and the States or the organization within three days after the request will not be named two arbit@@ rators , the community , or the organization , can nom@@ inate the President of the International Court of Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied if within three days after the name or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rators , the fifth arbit@@ rator has not been chosen .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is compl@@ ac@@ able , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the affected states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) This Convention occurs for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the contrac@@ tual agreement and members of the community are not@@ ified that his procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this agreement .
II ) If the community is not@@ ified that they are able to apply their securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this agreement .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States will consult each other on seeking one of the contract parties to a change in this agreement .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the States .
C ) Director General teaches all Member States of the organisation of any amend@@ ment to this agreement .
a ) The Convention occurs in power in which the organization of the Community and the States receives written notification , that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the States Parties .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and Protocol .
the purpose of this agreement is to determine how to carry out the provisions of the part I concerning securing measures as required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the objective of securing measures in this agreement is the tim@@ ely discovery of the waste material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core bodies for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such a rejection through the risk of premature discovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to en@@ rich@@ ment of the targets specified in Article 28 , the material preservation is used as the backup of basic meaning , und@@ ulating with the spatial integration and the observation as an important comple@@ mentary measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technical termination of the testing by the organization is performed by an explanation , in which for each material balance , which is specified for a specific period of material , with indic@@ ating the accuracy limits for the specified measuring range .
after carrying out their re@@ tests , the organization is based on Article 3 full use of the community &apos;s backup system .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material zones .
when applying for securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make the following type of use and they , as far as required , proceed as specified in the comple@@ mentary fill@@ ings :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of er@@ hal@@ ten@@ ant , produced , lost , lost , or in other ways out of the stock , core material and the stock of stock ;
B ) evalu@@ ating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement un@@ certainty ;
C ) Proce@@ dures to determine , testing and valu@@ ation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proce@@ dures to evaluate accumulation of not measured inventory and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that indicates the core material zone and the changes of this site including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) The precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to reim@@ bur@@ se reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this agreement does not extend to material in mining or in the arch@@ ery .
B ) the phase of the core fuel cycle that has not yet been reached ( b ) is not yet reached in the states , so the community of the organization is introduced to the amount and composition of the material as it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel manufacturing , or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced to the core material or other , in a later phase of the core fuel cycle of the core material in the states , it is subject to the others in this Convention .
a ) In this agreement , the backup measures shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community must not be authorized in Article 11 . if the provisions of core material , the backup measures are not possible or desired , the organisation and community should be adapted to each other via the application of suitable backup measures .
B ) The securing measures in this agreement will end for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 . if the organisation and community shall be con@@ sensual , that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ refundable .
upon request of the community the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures to this agreement :
a ) special material when it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
( B ) core material if it is used when non @-@ nuclear activities are used after Article 13 , if such nuclear material is refundable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ er of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon request of the community , the organisation of core material which otherwise will be subject to the agreement will be subject to that securing measures , as the whole , due to this article in the states released free core materi@@ als at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special pre@@ valent material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates Multi@@ p@@ lication of his weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the value of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates through multi@@ plying of his weight with the fifth square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and enriched ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of enriched ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or below ;
released core material along with core material , which is subject to safegu@@ ard or stored in this agreement , precau@@ tions for rest@@ oring the backup measures are made to that material .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets with the organization revision , which is necessary to apply to the successful and effective yield of the tasks of the organization after this agreement will determine how the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed in agreement with no change in agreement between the organization and the community .

the organization focuses on the basis of a summar@@ izing survey of the whole , subject to securing this agreement on the core material in the states , regardless of its origin , on and performs this stock schedule due to subsequent reports and results of their examination .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , Denmark , Ireland , Italy , Luxemburg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the other hand
in ER@@ WA@@ PO@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC decided to contribute to the special responsibility for international economic cooperation , to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with a low income , whose development is disabled by general resources .
C ) It is the purpose of the EEC and Member States , that the entire scope of the Member States will be bound by the Member States within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its potential to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted with the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the center bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC set out a table which is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special response &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which consists of funds under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special response &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; this account is used by the Organization as Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in this property , the organization is established in the following as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and under the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special asset account will be separate and separate from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) the payment will be made in the form of cash or fixed deposits of the member states , which are paid upon request in the currency of the organization on Order of the organization as an administrator of the contrac@@ tual account and to pay in the back@@ grounds of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . contribution within 30 days after in@@ force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the article on January 1 , 1979 or at another date , agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking account of the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval .
C ) Each member state can afford payments from the above mentioned dates .
the Administrator takes propor@@ tions in accordance with the usual process of organization about proportional pulling on the cash or school . to cover the expend@@ itu@@ res for the special agreements and to compens@@ ate the account in an appropriate manner .
during the warranty of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the EEC &apos;s conditions on the following factors :
III ) to have contributed to the extent , in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the trend of debt service in the country and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions without compensation ; and
VII ) the extent that the problems of the concerned countries may be gover@@ ned by contributions from other sources .
each special note loan is the financing of a clear risk and rapid expansion program or pre@@ ference ( including an audit@@ ory plan ) , which is independent , approved and managed according to the procedures and practices , which is considered by means of proper means of organization financed by the organization , which is called ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement to consider the goal of the addition of the Indi@@ c@@ ality .
the funds of the special contrac@@ tual account may not be used instead of the average funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization , as part of a loan or loan .
apart from section 4 , special agreements are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which apply to the Organization &apos;s loan in general ; therefore , they are payable in ten years , each in 50 years .
special agreements are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this prayer are directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
each special note loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in which the origin of the resources is stated .
revenues from each promotional loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ; ( ii ) in developing countries , which are the members of the organisation , and that according to what the car@@ et@@ aker defined at the time of loan nutrition , benef@@ ici@@ aries of a special transaction could be .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ment of special action @-@ loans do not occur in the currency account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is returned to its entrance as soon as possible from the administrator to the relevant member state .
the manager teaches the EEC to complete all of the special agreements , which are responsible for exam@@ ining the directors in preparation by the directors in preparation and approved by the directors of approved projects and programmes .
during the time of the payout of the special transaction , the manager teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special agreements and the expenses .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organisation a comprehensive billing statement of the organization with an external audit@@ or of the organization to this account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full @-@ payment of the special transaction , the manager of the EEC will be commun@@ icated as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects funded by the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Administrator is prepared and conduc@@ ts suitable records and calcul@@ ators , out of which the contributions to the account funds sent from the account agreements and deposits made from the account paid amounts and withdraw@@ als to the Member States .
the EEC and car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator until the complete issue of the funds for the special transaction , financed programmes or plans and about all other questions which affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may agree not into force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement , the total capital of all claims had been rep@@ aid and rejected on the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this agreement will require approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the legal provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States par@@ ishes the Council &apos;s general secretary of the Council of the European Communities .
the Secretary @-@ Secret@@ ariat also direc@@ ts these not@@ if@@ ications with a notification on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation .
this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of the entrance of the mentioned notification .
this agreement is covered in two signat@@ ures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby all the wording of the wording is binding .
in fact , the agreement in the form of a change to change the protocol A of the protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is adopted by the following regulation :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation of the Swiss nuclear fusion and the plasma hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test system , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a joint venture to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom @-@ Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for several years , Switzerland deals with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs and is well familiar with the area concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion are still extensive work , it is in the interests of the contract parties to avoid unnecessary over@@ flow and their respective research work which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this agreement is intended to set up every contrac@@ ting party in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma samples provided for the mutual research work , i.e. the common objective of this research work , d.@@ h . the cost @-@ effective electrical power production by using the controlled kernel reaction to be reached quickly .
to achieve the objective of this agreement , the contrac@@ ting parties associated with their respective app App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement defined research programs , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term targets and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or modified in accordance with Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement above , that if necessary , new activities may be relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every time , if the contrac@@ ting parties have a new program , this will refer to the programmes listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association , intended in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - appropriate participation in each of the contract parties during preparation and implementing the programs of the other party ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratory organization in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third states , with which Eur@@ atom has closed a similar agreement as the underlying agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ate Third Parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the Labor@@ atories , which work at the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the framework of this agreement , Switzerland is involved in the project J@@ ET .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the implementation of the association agreement made in Article 2 of this agreement , the contract parties include an association agreement called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association organs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are concluded with regard to the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective of Eur@@ atom , Eur@@ atom contributes to the promotion of staff members , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated Organ@@ iz@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is one of the most powerful J@@ ET company agreement , whose stat@@ ute shall be accepted .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom contributes to ensure that Switzerland &apos;s contrac@@ tual partner can be cancelled , except association contracts or other similar contracts which are closed by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of this agreement .
the bodies that have been commissioned with the implementation of the association under Article 2 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , belong to the consent of a steering committee , to the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of the research work is to monitor and so that best results are achieved in line with the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ates within the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Eur@@ atom programme - represented in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the V@@ G , which has the information exchange and cooperation regarding the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , has true this task concerning all research and development activities , which refers to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated companies and is aimed at the interest of both parties in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program as well as in the Swiss program and in articles 1 of the present agreement , which will be taken into consideration in the world to prominent scientific and technological developments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to its Rules of Pro@@ cedure , V@@ G appointed one or more of the Swiss representatives within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the Swiss authorities are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coun@@ sel@@ ing groups that provide the V@@ G research proposals in terms of funding the best possible scientific results , take this task concerning all research and development work true , which is refer@@ enced in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in line with the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on mobi@@ lizing the demands of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial aid
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credit@@ ors , if the banks make an appropriate request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the rates paid in the mechanism by credit@@ ors , and within a total limits of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future sales units of the member countries .
however , however , some conditions have been named , whose application would be the BIS ready .
for each stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially take over a commitment to two years , with the possibility of extensions , without that a total of five years are exceeded .
with the opening of loans as well as their elev@@ ations , the BIS would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , the first pulling will not be made prior to exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the required adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the draw would be made available in the BIS at the end of the agreement available , most likely in US dollars ; they would go to periods considered by taking into account the resources of the bank , expected three or six months .

in the form of a letter between the European Economic Community and the Argentin@@ ean Republic on the trade with hamm@@ am - and lamb
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honour me to define the recent negotiations between the import of Hamm@@ el - , lamb - and goats from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of joint market organisation for sheep - and goat meat in relation to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;
- fresh or frozen Hamm@@ el - lamb - and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export options for Hamm@@ el - , lamb - and goats from Argentina have set the following yearly quantity : 20 000 tons , expressed in slaughter @-@ weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina has committed to ensure that the quantity delivered in actual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with traditional offer ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trading , the two parties of this agreement will consult the adoption of such a change in which under number 10 mentioned may be found in order to find an appropriate solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the event that the community is entitled to ensure that the cl@@ ause is required to ensure that the access to this agreement is not affected by the joint market in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case that the imports from Argentina have exceeded the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community obli@@ ges itself to restri@@ ct the exhau@@ st@@ ion on immigrants from this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ no@@ zzle of 10 BC . ad val@@ o@@ rem .
with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount under number 2 , corresponding to the extent of the Argentin@@ ian trade with each new member state .
the regi@@ str@@ ations for these new Member States are sti@@ pul@@ ated under the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will be charged under number 5 stated set of exhau@@ st@@ ion .
the total amount paid under number 2 is fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community of 23 000 tons of slaughter .
the Community is under@@ taking everything to avoid market development which could affect the marketing of Argentin@@ ean Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ite in the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community also meets arrangements for frozen meat to frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argentin@@ ian Hamm@@ el - and lamb &apos;s meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account of the goals and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es to ensure that every actual application of hol@@ dings and lam@@ bs , as well as for the contemp@@ t of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , only at prices and conditions , which account with the existing international obligations in line and consider the traditional proportion of community trade with these products .
these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention to Design and Application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
in particular , Argentina guarantees the adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular , that it has given a specified quantity of export licenses for the products mentioned in this agreement .
