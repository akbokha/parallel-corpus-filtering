the present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ination Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained as the Committee on Human@@ Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , in which the study conducted for use concerning the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packer ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. vort@@ ex thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal atmosphere ) are alternat@@ ely with a periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe Man@@ ic episodes and to measure man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to capture or processed tablets in patients , which determine the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ ili@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occurrence is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ ili@@ fy , the repet@@ ition of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ ili@@ fy was compared with twelve weeks in 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ ili@@ fy and placebo to re@@ occur in 160 patients with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ ili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which resulted in increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients treated to treatment .
the company also led studies to study how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( intake ) .
in both studies with injection @-@ solution showed patients who received Abi@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ ili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ ili@@ fy prevented the revival of Man@@ ic episodes at previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administered .
Abi@@ ili@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , se@@ wer , Nau@@ sea ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( di@@ lap@@ se ) , relief , Nau@@ sea ( di@@ lap@@ se ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , sleep disorders , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
at the conclusion that the benefits of human@@ eness ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium to heavy man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , against the risks involved .
furthermore , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the transport of Abi@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a daily allowance of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
a increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors justify these ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ ary behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder did not increase the risk of suicide by using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure , over@@ head disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are applied to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials mentioned a year or less , there was occa@@ sional reporting during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l occurring Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
when treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ un@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient sign signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
thus , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with an@@ archy in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at conditions that are applied with cal@@ am@@ ity cases in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l associated with patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ne@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ne@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients suffering with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances treated patients who permit direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or could lead to serious complications .
because of the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l can be taken in combination with alcohol or other central realistic medicines with excess side effects ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 may result in higher plasma devices of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ di@@ zation .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should not exceed the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ eases , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
after deduc@@ ting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors you should increase the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dos@@ ish@@ height from the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ do@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data situation on the human being , and due to the concerns caused by animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , like other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be warned , hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were treated with a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ c@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , d@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ne@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ical episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory tests occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in clinical trials and since market launch were un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis is found in treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely to have hem@@ ost@@ atic in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma binding .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is commun@@ icated to the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a , and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 no@@ rep@@ ellent and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of the responsibility was observed in week 52 , in both groups similar to study medication ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study of sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over a placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l pointed out 12 a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .

in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and also showed gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
a pop @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving human liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .

Man@@ ical episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is commun@@ icated to the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study of sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative , bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to healthy volunteers was compared , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

these effects were observed in rab@@ bits that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose , observed .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ itation and behavior in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not attached .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under env@@ elop@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status considering the drug ad@@ mitt@@ ent or acute treatments ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further leading oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral distur@@ ban@@ ces that were caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in extreme cases or a blood pressure if ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drug ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure , over@@ head disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are applied to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of Sed@@ an was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as a one @-@ time in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ities , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 may result in higher plasma devices of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
after deduc@@ ting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors you should increase the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dos@@ ish@@ height from the beginning of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , was the intensity of Sed@@ an compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :

107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory tests occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and Cr@@ itic attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces were compared with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ ors compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as aggres@@ s@@ ity and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in symptoms in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean recovery of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to reduced patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of the responsibility was observed in week 52 , in both groups similar to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study of sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less than 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in regard to preventing a bi@@ polar back , primarily in prevention of a bi@@ polar rear .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection the AU@@ C according to the gift of the same dose as tablet ; System@@ ic exposure was similar among the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was to reach the maximum plasma membrane with 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target after repeated treatment with a systematic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous application , non @-@ safety concerns for material exposure caused by intra@@ ven@@ ous exposure resulting in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , reproduction and can@@ di@@ ous potential , the pre @-@ clinical data could no particular danger to humans .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 460 women have received with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three @-@ quarters would have received an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a few gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse events ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients with conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs and survival compared to the effectiveness of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer were demonstrated in relation to these indicators , that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ s in the blood .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane has no longer to be applied more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs not have to be given with other medicines to reduce adverse effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ sives Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted an approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and is not displayed for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ rop@@ od count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Deg@@ ree 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement of degrees 1 or 2 is reached , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data to im@@ balance and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nano @-@ form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be abol@@ ished immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be introduced , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced , until the neut@@ ro@@ ar number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ resc@@ ence has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity was not detected , kar@@ di@@ al inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ gest@@ ing means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or with women in a bound age who do not practise an effective recept@@ ors , except the mother of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , during and up to six months after the treatment of no child .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment on a sperm production , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport and ability of the machines .
the following are the most common and main inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al clinical Phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ ing ; Leu@@ c@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
≥ 1 / 10 ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two @-@ part blind@@ ly @-@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients that were treated in a randomised phase III study study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer patients were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 ( 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation ) to the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metal stations .
14 % had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity towards Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who had experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 of 3 patients during therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy to dis@@ sound on Bas@@ eline based on cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the substances ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similarly to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma membrane took off in a multi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or plast@@ ic@@ izer from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced sound tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ lized ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic mamm@@ ali@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma was the average total of 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , over 75 years of age in the age of 75 , only a few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with normal blood @-@ iron values may occur in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the blood pressure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; injection can also be made by the patient or his host@@ master , unless they have a proper instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ iles ) or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are necessary to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and ice @-@ energ@@ y- should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby , that the body does not adequ@@ ately stim@@ ulate the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the effects of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , em@@ powered it to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to injection as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were either moved to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations between the beginning of the study and the follow @-@ up period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled se@@ ab@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed as in the same degree as in those patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ating mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , or other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this caused no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the rules of the European Union of proof , the medicine has been a comparable quality , safety and efficiency profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information specialists in all Member States of Information , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg an approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and with which the risk of trans@@ fusion because of the general condition ( for example , cardi@@ ovascular status , existing an@@ a@@ emia ) exists .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ sufficient , in planned larger operating terms , which require a large blood sugar rate ( 4 or more units of blood for men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for a reduction in foreign bl@@ ut Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion compensation is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied , which can not participate in an autonomous blood pressure program .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , assess@@ ing the individual clinical trials and disease by the doctor is required .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ glob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values may be observed on or under hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is inc@@ lined by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored , to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest allowed dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and angi@@ ogen@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with the initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher yield gains in patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with the initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher yield gains in patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary , with an increase in dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
initial symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ load ; therefore , assess@@ ing the individual clinical trials and disease by the doctor is required .
given this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the patients should be monitored eng@@ aging , to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest allowed dose , which is required for controlling memory symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin price by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes decreased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be maintained three times per week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
when hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin grew &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times per week three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value decreased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ dispos@@ ition of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ ings is needed , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron substance should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood pressure program - started to make large iron reserves prior to the start of the se@@ a@@ amed therapy .
6 . the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) .

in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( ESA ) were observed with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine symptoms , if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration is increased by the concentration of an@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of hyper@@ tension .

if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of potential thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dos@@ ing value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the patient &apos;s participation which should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger electrical orthop@@ e@@ dic intervention should be , if possible , before the start of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients suffering from a larger electrical orthop@@ e@@ dic intervention should maintain a proper Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ al proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in an underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
moreover , it may not be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa drugs for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can consist .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that cancer patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia may improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tum@@ our cancer .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of fra@@ ction ( bone mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including patients who have suffered a less@@ trau@@ matic envelope as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 m@@ g. of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection to a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
to treat Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data stock for zom@@ eta was drawn to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with o@@ steopor@@ osis were involved , and it was investigated by the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture . it was investigated by the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase is in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood , or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % compared to placebo .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other phosph@@ ates .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions on the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physi@@ cians , which contains as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug may be explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued the company Novartis Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited an approval for the transport system of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
the patient &apos;s information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Acc@@ ept@@ ance of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to get medical or nursing assistance .
treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after operating the hip fra@@ ction . ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long R@@ emis@@ sion period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.@@ E. or@@ tic or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the treatment of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dos@@ ing adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are not recommended to use with children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data to lack of confidenti@@ ality and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to treat A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a before the beginning of the therapy with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ ig@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered prior to a application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental examination with reasonable pre @-@ ventil@@ ating dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw range .
clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the treatment of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
in case of patients , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall sti@@ ff@@ ness of atri@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occa@@ sional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ ired drug @-@ effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid has been associated with kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were similar in an o@@ steopor@@ osis study about three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary raising of the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins in 10 days following administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) amounted to 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental amount of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions According to the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion spot , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area of money was reported , especially in cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the pine zone ) , containing bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports relates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area at one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hy@@ po@@ cal@@ an@@ emia , an in@@ fusion of calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ less ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal cord .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spine ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a demonstrated an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of lum@@ bar spine around 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hips at 6.0 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients , who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic cre@@ st .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis revealed in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to placebo in an increase in bone volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ vers@@ cul@@ ary bone architecture .
bone sales @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen type ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were measured from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at all ages and sh@@ ame@@ works at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of BM@@ D to 5.4 % at the total amount and around 4.3 % at stake .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study were randomised to 508 men , and 185 patients were evaluated by BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % for placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the once @-@ weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , in comparison to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ vort@@ ex @-@ BM@@ D , compared to the initial value of 24 months .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed mor@@ se Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg e@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of cra@@ y@@ ric acid once daily has been demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed compared to the starting value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as a responsibility ( on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic approach was achieved at 141 who treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes persist@@ ing in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ ed independently .
after that , the plasma mask rapidly decreased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ end times t ½ α 0.0@@ 24 and t ½ h 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) will represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against Time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of met@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ers of met@@ abo@@ lized substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized with humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or mis@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
hence , a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dos@@ ing adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
for heavy kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are possible , these population are no statements possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ al acting intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without any ren@@ al influence .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ination Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained as the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mono@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medicine ( therapy medicine ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or insulin , the previous dose of sulph@@ ate resin or insulin can be maintained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ ate resin and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better utilized and dec@@ eler@@ ates blood sugar levels , making type 2 diabetes better .
for more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of acet@@ ate in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa dy@@ e , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
the account led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible that blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional treatment of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sulph@@ ate resin in a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who had an addition to insulin , a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took in addition placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were sight disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one ( high level of k@@ et@@ on@@ ization - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is used as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to provide approval for the account of Ac@@ tos in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and bear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate for those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ com@@ compens@@ ated heart failure should begin to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ aler reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
cardi@@ ovascular Out@@ come study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports about con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to the 3 @-@ fold of the standard range , the liver values are soon to be used as soon as possible .
in case patient symptoms developed on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , colon@@ os@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n are the liver values .
the decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted by clinical assessment as well .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fat deposits and is connected to some cases with liquid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ el@@ ution in therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ t@@ ant in 3 @-@ 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of hem@@ atology ( 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitivity consists of patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fa dy@@ e or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ ing dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
according to the market launch , thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ Indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ma to be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ma if patients report about distur@@ b@@ ance of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a sum@@ ming analysis of messages undes@@ irable events in frac@@ tures , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years of study of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures performed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient desire a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ y@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ai@@ ds are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) , it resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resist@@ ence of the parent and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for killing growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; sometimes &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents went out to the thre@@ e@@ fold threshold of the standard range equally , such as placebo , but less commonly used in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ate har@@ p .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ v .
since the market launch rarely has been reported via heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been applied in combination with insulin or patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
in summary , an overall analysis of messages undes@@ irable events were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 year current PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
after taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator and Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and periph@@ eral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the case of insulin resist@@ ency .
a clinical study conducted with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years to investigate the period of therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ de .
in a placebo controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate , despite thre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ zed optimum phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who remain only insulin ; a reduction in insulin treatment was observed in the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statist@@ ically significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ int@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tic examination in 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and small , however , clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statist@@ ically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ foli@@ age were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the sober tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de level , but also improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de mirror , this has a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as on the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a cardi@@ ovascular outcomes study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized in groups with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular treatment , either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly with the top concentration of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the plasma normally 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , M @-@ IV contribution to efficacy in about the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels have been significantly reduced to as much as with another Human@@ ity .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ eness ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component .
furthermore , boxes of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the package directions ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ yl@@ ane resulted in the treatment of diabetes over the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , issued an approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initi@@ ate effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
injection no@@ bility must be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have significantly improved by an intensive insulin treatment , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia warning symptoms can be perceived and therefore should be advised accordingly .
any change in regards to strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( animal insulin , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic , long @-@ effective insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin origin ) may cause a change of dosage is required .
if necessary , when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose of dose is necessary , it may be necessary during the first time or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal insulin to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his doctor since such travels can also be taken or taken in meals at other times .
the doctor should therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy and in@@ quire of his patients with other drugs .

a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia can , however , be continuously developing : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics can be treated by oral supply of glucose or glucose foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape fragments , sweets , biscuits or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid person or given by glucose , which is administered intra@@ ven@@ ously through the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component .
moreover , Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses have to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , issued an approval for the transport system of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
if two species of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast @-@ acting insulin must first be drawn , then the amount of the long @-@ effective insulin .
3 If when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , a dose of dose is necessary , it may be necessary in the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his doctor since such travels can also be taken or taken in meals at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already identified signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or se@@ al@@ ment notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary tract of urine after two to four weeks is still above 6 mg per dec@@ iles , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , accidents may still occur ; therefore , patients will be taken during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of exposure cases .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ splantation , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness three of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main inde@@ er for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ure@@ ment of urine was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily took 120 m@@ g. a day in the blood of under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
by comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and not one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart attack in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lo@@ wering of the ureth@@ ra , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history or currently present se@@ al@@ ies and / or gas@@ ket ) .
if the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ fication amounts to 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose of dos@@ ing to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function limits , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
for children and adolescents , as there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant recept@@ ors There are no experiences yet with organ tran@@ spl@@ ants , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardi@@ ovascular diseases in patients with isch@@ e@@ al heart disease or de@@ compression con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure is not recommended for treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ ni@@ fying medicines , it may occur during treatment in an acute g@@ utter failure , because of the lo@@ wering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ fication of first ureth@@ ra deposits in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed .

liver disease During clinical trials of phase 3 , slight precip@@ itation of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to clinical results ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was had no interaction studies on f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( in@@ hibition of the Met@@ abol@@ ism of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
at test , the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with a rise of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study of subjects covered 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak internal effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , reduces the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , and a decrease of the C@@ max is 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data about a limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies can not be made at any side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow immediate or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxes of vehicle , serving machines , or during exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be reason@@ ably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has not affected its performance .
in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statist@@ ically significant differences were found , and no caus@@ ally correlation was found with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors used in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cler@@ osis and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .

the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those that were reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to data according to the data .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two piv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ onic emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study in the proportion of patients with which the last three month certain ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ fication &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ en@@ at@@ in@@ ine worth of study ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ at@@ in@@ ine value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statist@@ ically significant excess of 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used cans of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statist@@ ically significant excess of 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) in terms of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid block to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently over the whole treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functional restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function limit ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the serum response in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ aci@@ dic concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had to study the beginning of study ( Bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the Phase 3 extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent decrease of the serum concentration on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gas@@ eous waste ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a se@@ al@@ ant feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the seal of seals , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the exposure to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma on@@ centr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma @-@ center time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at upward is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses above 120 mg and 300 m@@ g. a rise in AU@@ C is observed , the greater than the dos@@ si@@ proportional increase is observed .
after the intake of simple or multi@@ pl@@ ers or@@ aler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3,2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration , unless it was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

the plasma integration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary ties to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ant metabol@@ ites are formed mainly through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly formed by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or inhal@@ ing other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are registered in the European Union , the company provided data that come from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively were Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive apparatus , such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( swal@@ lowing ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ atory disorders ) , so@@ res ( ul@@ um knee ) , split abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed belly ) and su@@ ck up .
patients with high sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be used in case of diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can &apos;t sit or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or inhal@@ ation of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day .
the following clu@@ es are to be determined precisely to reduce the risk of hel@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and thus related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed after the rise of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients shall not take care of the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . ep@@ tical ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ tures , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were mostly severe and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore highlight attention to all the signs and symptoms that are pointed out to possible inci@@ dents such as Dy@@ spher@@ ic , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or wor@@ sen@@ able heart@@ burn , or to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correct and / or after the occurrence of symptoms resulting in a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses are passed to patients and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at had no increased risk ( according to market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , some of them were severe and with complications ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available , the clu@@ es indicate whether the use of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ otherapy in patients who dimin@@ ish a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the doctor @-@ treated doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take care of the dose of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after they have noticed their sow@@ ing .
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking the consumption of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the start of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients after intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or for breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaged effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are of cancer patients , but was also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis .
nevertheless , serum for serum @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums until &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum @-@ phosph@@ ats up to 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , with the application of Ad@@ vaginal / Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ s@@ in .
the main inde@@ er of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was adjusted according to a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or res@@ um@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splantation and examined how Ad@@ vaginal did in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ants , this drug should sort or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immune supp@@ ression .
patients should always retain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a medical profession ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ is@@ ations must be performed to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Dos@@ age of Ad@@ vaginal Should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock and toler@@ ability in individual cases and bleeding ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations )
after the conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure measured as a human mirror , comparable to both form@@ ulations both at ren@@ al and le@@ ber@@ tran@@ spl@@ anted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks of tran@@ spl@@ ant under Ad@@ vaginal , to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ age can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of approx .
duration of use for the repression of tran@@ spl@@ ant shock must be maintained ; however , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dos@@ ages - kidney tran@@ splantation of tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ splantation The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dos@@ ages - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant diagnosis The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vaginal must have to be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal capsules , this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the daily dose of daily intake .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vaginal once daily , treatment with the recommended initial dose of tran@@ splantation is recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant .
tran@@ spl@@ ant For adult patients , which are converted to Ad@@ vaginal , is a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once every day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recept@@ ors may have no clinical experience with Ad@@ vaginal patient in pneum@@ onia , pan@@ kre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ spl@@ anted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for use .
dos@@ is@@ adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood met@@ abolic in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver disorders a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Da ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can assume that a dose is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ en@@ at@@ in@@ ae ) is recommended to calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of urea volume ) .
changing of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vaginal When switching from a Cic@@ los@@ s@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ st mirror in full blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock absor@@ bing and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks of tran@@ splantation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vaginal , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes to immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Ad@@ vaginal has a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State joined .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the view mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for adren@@ al and heart @-@ tran@@ spl@@ anted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
normally , blood concentrations were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml during the following treatment of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ants .
it has led to serious adverse events including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always retain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a medical profession ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant diagnosis , proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va as therapy @-@ resistant , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Ad@@ vaginal raf .
on the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ fts with adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recept@@ ors and tran@@ spl@@ ant recept@@ ors in inf@@ ancy are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Ad@@ vaginal raf .
because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may include , or other plant enh@@ ancers during treatment with Ad@@ vaginal raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful surveillance of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases referred to as car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed as car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy and observed the chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hic , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorders , infections , liquid exposure and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions by suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , alter@@ ing levels of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision should show a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g . )
as Ad@@ vaginal hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose , is provided in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can also affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the present gift of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining uniform concentration levels accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly derived from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal displac@@ ement , results .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , like it is used by acute immune reactions , may increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
impact of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on metabolism of other medicines of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ lized using CY@@ P@@ A4 , which may affect metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down@@ fall the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increasing the hormone exposure , it is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive contrac@@ ting measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half time .
the results of a low number of gra@@ fts in gra@@ fts patient provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , there is an increased risk of undes@@ irable events with regard to the course and the outcome of the pregnancy .

Adv@@ oc@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII un@@ conditional , con@@ genital ble@@ ating disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application determine if Adv@@ oc@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions .
patients suffering from hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell which has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) , which it is capable of the formation of the human being factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate is similar to another drug named re@@ combin@@ ate , similar , but is different from any other , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe up@@ to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % has been rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common cause of Adv@@ oc@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies over factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate may not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human distur@@ bing factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG an approval for the transport system from Adv@@ oc@@ ate to the whole of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of subst@@ itution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the place and the extent of blood and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
for the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor of VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over .
during the treatment of treatment , the administered dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions provide adequate determination of the factor of VIII @-@ plasma bars .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , different in vivo Recovery and have different se@@ wer@@ ies .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses of 20 to 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII @-@ plasma activity cannot be reached , or if the bleeding is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to im@@ itate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor of VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed .
the delivery speed should be adjusted according to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , with Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 ex@@ positions of the largest and genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 position and an@@ amor@@ phic inhibit@@ or development , after the conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ occur@@ ing ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
because of the rare emergence of the H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s have been occurring in the largest number of patients suffering from factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who showed an increased risk of inhibit@@ ors that have increased risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not predictable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patient ( 234 ) ( 234 ) The unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII @-@ mir@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained during all the time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma and Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( ≥ 150 days ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only showed one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , one of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years of age and diagnostic severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was confirmed by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously un@@ treated patients of an ongoing clinical study were treated 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients to factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of pri@@ es@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ocy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the context of the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk and considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
so the CH@@ MP has on the basis of the security film of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially shared the Committee on Human@@ ism for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company takes its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ant@@ to for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bone or the sof@@ ten parts ( tissue which connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and leans ) .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that there can be a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could then be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein which is produced from the not defective in the human body , usually contributes to rest@@ oring damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein isn &apos;t right , and the cancer cells may grow further and share themselves .
the company put data from a study of a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions , there were still some questions .
based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP has been created on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not adequ@@ ately proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore gains advantages for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , and the security of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be established in a reliable manner , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company won &apos;t inform the CH@@ MP whether the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ mis@@ @-@ Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed action @-@ release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released for a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seas@@ on@@ ally allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused by p@@ ollen ) in patients with nostr@@ ils ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nostr@@ ils ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the block@@ age of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the alter@@ ations of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , which were reported in the treatment before treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all hypo@@ cr@@ up@@ f@@ ens@@ y@@ symptoms except the block@@ age of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % of the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a has been viewed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % against 26.@@ 7 % in the patient that the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone took .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity , aspir@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders , and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be sensitive to patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients that are not used to treat aller@@ gies or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treating aller@@ gies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients with patients ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ovascular disease ( hyper@@ thy@@ mus ) , cardi@@ ovascular disease ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) , cardi@@ ovascular disease ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or having a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ ic stroke ) or having a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted an approval for the In@@ tra@@ ders of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the whole of the European Union on 30 July 2007 .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to crum@@ ble or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data to in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after det@@ ailing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as at long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be removed .
after a decline in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherapy .
because Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine also contains contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ur@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , dy@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , dy@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , nap@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ ro@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data will not suff@@ ice to address respective recommendations for dosage .
safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function problems , and the data will not suff@@ ice to address respective recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that treating a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ ometer , heart rhythm disorders , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or loss of other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
for the treatment of following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , bladder , and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine may otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce to extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and placebo could be detected , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ consistency of the application of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and at the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it may result in excessive toler@@ ability of transport and ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S voice ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or etc . ) .

a CN@@ S voice is particularly likely , as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the release of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as blocking of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective protection or tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects such as increasing blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S detection .
1.@@ 248 patients received seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis in the age between 12 and 78 years , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ til@@ ation ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al s@@ nat@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers for 14 days , the total surface of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine has been reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was noted that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were po@@ or@@ ly changed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ fuel was the exposure of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , to reduce tox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot be recognized for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .

for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml syrup or w .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to im@@ itate that the body is the syrup , the solution to feed and the melting tablets in the same way util@@ ises how the tablets and application of children are harmless .
in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us have resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % for patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe for approval for the transport system of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and pri@@ es@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are restricted experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine with adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the symptoms of the disease and may be resumed after re@@ viewing the symptoms .
the persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the everyday life .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol does not ampli@@ fied the most effective impact of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied in fact that it may result in very rare cases that lead to impair@@ ment of transport and ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients suffering from patients suffering from placebo .
the most commonly found side effects that was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
at a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the release of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells .
there was no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically significant cardi@@ ovascular effect on a clinical study of up to 20 m@@ g. daily in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in a single dos@@ ing study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective protection or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ eses , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ence and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as the basis of the overall co@@ res of question@@ naire was shown in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the load caused by seasonal or allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was also examined for further forms of the Ur@@ b@@ aria , since the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easier pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular illnesses , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also carried out in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and watch@@ fulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable to patients with the general seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis population was achieved in 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded entirely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate is an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( o@@ ily , low @-@ cal@@ ory breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials carried out with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the tox@@ icity profiles of the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , del@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be seen in no particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and pri@@ es@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest using an inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in the diagnosis of the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical studies and related laboratory studies .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine constra@@ ined and experienced a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ lized - is identical to those with children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency this medicine may not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol does not ampli@@ fy the most efficient impact of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total rigi@@ dity of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us syrup group like the placebo group .
clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients suffering from patients suffering from placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
at an average daily dose of 7.5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies lead to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to increase alcohol @-@ induced performance levels nor increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose .
the prolifer@@ ation of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study involving the syrup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which is constra@@ ined met@@ abolic , observed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in enzyme has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .

in June 2008 , Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. divided the Committee on Human Medic@@ inal det@@ erg@@ ents ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N1 flu in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by the influ@@ enza A virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine which might cause a strain of influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic arises when a new strain of the influ@@ enza virus emerges , which can easily spread from person to person , because people have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system contained in the vaccine known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a influ@@ enza virus of this Stam@@ ms faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface hull &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body wei@@ rd ) separated , st@@ oned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the scope of clinical data base is not sufficient for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical trial and need further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years containing human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is causing the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inhal@@ ing , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be classified if the doctor has tested the an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient had previously taken , and the probability of which the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ ce@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV volume in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not to cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously un@@ treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ism .
this with low dos@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who used formerly Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other Prot@@ eas@@ ants .
the main inde@@ er for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentration of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ections had taken , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ism , only very few to the treatment .
in the study of adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased as effective as 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other Prot@@ eas@@ ants :
in the patients suffering from HIV that was resistant to four other prot@@ ections , it came to a stronger blo@@ c of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patients who further took their previous prot@@ ections :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r or other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals that are de@@ compos@@ ing as much as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as in other medicines against HIV , patients who use A@@ gener@@ ase are taking the risk of an lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of infection ) , or an immune activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set that the benefits of as@@ end@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been taken no prot@@ ections , is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited an approval for the transport system of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ gers of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r combined with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r should be performed by taking the individual viral infections and the patient treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r as a solution to import is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake levels per milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gers ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ end@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ections were not examined in children .
as@@ end@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use of patients with severe or excessive liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function cases , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which possess a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma devices and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver disease @-@ effects with potentially fatal evolution .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r using Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , that is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the inter@@ changeable of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is dependent strongly of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , an in@@ tim@@ ely administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm ratio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the active concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma blocks of Am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , but the information is not enough to assess the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ine symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl / gly@@ col solution , this form@@ ulation form is contra@@ indicated by children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eases , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , or an ex@@ cip@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses to which therapy medicines were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as long lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
for em@@ ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ism , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous combustion of hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a heavy immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune supp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is , in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of as@@ end@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which possess a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma blocks with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
when attemp@@ ting to offset the harvest@@ ed plasma mask through a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum mirror of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ pressed by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already recorded St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ us@@ av@@ ir@@ st levels and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and ab@@ ort the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose of dos@@ ing for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ sh@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ max to 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and confidenti@@ ality of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as .
52 % dri@@ fting when am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for simultaneous administration of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , but it is recommended to have a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance , since the efficacy and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose is required .
the treatment with E@@ an@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ections would be harvest@@ ed .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ eases and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may be sun@@ k into the serum concentration of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma brackets .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; thorough clinical and astronom@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma cutting ( AU@@ C ) by R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , is to be given at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma blocks of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ein@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plasma of 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole compared to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interaction .
patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions , which are monitored using these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ eases , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma mask of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ ni@@ di@@ pole , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased 10 through Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , causing possibly the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , the plasma core can increase considerably and rein@@ force with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection to adverse events including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma membrane rose by about 86 % ( 90 % cone interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not advised along with these glucose levels , unless the potential benefits of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose re@@ trac@@ ting is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , the prolifer@@ ation of plasma frames can be expected at the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
because plasma increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
there will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until the stabil@@ isation of the mirrors , as the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by the present gift of Am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral in@@ fest@@ ed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma pie@@ kes of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in Op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ine symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the slight neg@@ ligence of historical compar@@ isons can now be given no recommendation , such as the Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ an dosage is to be adjusted at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
for the present gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the present gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug may only be used during pregnancy during pregnancy , considering the possible use@@ fulness for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the milk remaining rats , am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known if am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r is covered with people in their breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ dis@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight .
further development of the descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ produ@@ tion capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r .
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , coming early up and rarely led to treatment departure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time used to treat HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the atro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of these side effects are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients un@@ treated patients were treated 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) used by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study medication and were listed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with HIV patient re@@ distribution ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast fat tissues , increased in@@ domin@@ ate and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ ical fat collection ( Sti@@ cks ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons , which were treated with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a median duration of 36 weeks , was observed just one case ( cut@@ ters ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - in pre @-@ treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 241 patients at In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash normally were mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and compet@@ ed spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a heavy immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients , 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase were observed twice daily along with low @-@ dos@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .
Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r binds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the process of viral pol@@ ym@@ ers and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ ym@@ ers with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in treating anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eases - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r had received twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a cerv@@ ical failure occurred to week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically analyzed .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a four @-@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ F , M@@ 3@@ V , M@@ 3@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2a , V@@ 8@@ 2A , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with cerv@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ections of inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r related to patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 90@@ V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of an ast@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
in conjunction with the phen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations of clinical data , the phen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies which distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a dimin@@ ished sensitivity to the Am@@ us@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross @-@ resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r .
there is currently data for the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ d resist@@ or , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral infections ( one of them demonstrated against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulating ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulating ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in the way , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that can affect subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the section A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis did the non @-@ sub@@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average speed of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ til@@ ated wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of efficacy of non @-@ controlled A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered in the therapeutic optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ob@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the median duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
thus , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the equivalent of dietary intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close a large distribution volume as well as a imp@@ aired penetration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of non @-@ bound am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the non @-@ active ingredient during dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state concentration on the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ se@@ able as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a billi@@ ard base .
also the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be small to the elim@@ ination of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those who are achieved on healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous cancellation of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ o@@ gene@@ ity with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ bi@@ ous aden@@ ome in dos@@ ages , which the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) of exposure to humans , after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for creating hep@@ ato@@ bi@@ ous aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , due to the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic use , however , few hints for the adoption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro diagnostics tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test of human periph@@ eral lympho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and monitored in clinical use by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity with young animals that have been treated from the age of 4 , showed high mortality in both the controls and with the am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
however , with a systematic Plas@@ ma@@ Drive , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of minor changes were observed , including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal alter@@ ations , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gers ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use of patients with weak or slight liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function cases , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm ratio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the efficacy concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of an lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an ast@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased for C@@ max to 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for simultaneous administration of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , but it is recommended to have a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance , since the efficacy and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ an@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ections would be harvest@@ ed .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; thorough clinical and astronom@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is to be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose can be reached at least half of the recommended dose , though no clinical data is available .

in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma membrane rose by about 86 % ( 90 % cone interval 82 to 89 % ) .
for the present gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ yel@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r by 22 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful considering the possible use@@ fulness for mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ dis@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight .
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r is 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in the way , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; Un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the non @-@ active ingredient during dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state concentration on the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..
therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions , or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function is likely to be small in the elim@@ ination of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ o@@ gene@@ ity with am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ ato@@ bi@@ ous aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , who spoke to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for creating hep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , have little evidence for adop@@ ting a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro diagnostics tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test of human periph@@ eral lympho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity with young animals that have been treated from the age of 4 , showed high mortality in both the controls and with the am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
these results indicate that in young , the metabol@@ ites are not fully equipped , so that am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of form@@ ulation ( z ) .

the benefits of using a Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; solution to intake , either with PI pre@@ treated patients , has been treated with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r as a solution to import is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake levels per milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ end@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , there must be no dos@@ ing pass for simultaneous use of A@@ generic ase solution to intake and low dos@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination with these patient groups .
although a dose adap@@ tion is not necessary for am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ generic ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic risk of toxic substances , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to intake in infants and children under 4 years , for pregnant women , with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous suspension can lead to a competent in@@ hibition of met@@ abol@@ ism and possibly causing severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk of treating HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the efficacy concentration .

in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cr@@ ème but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main inde@@ er for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete re@@ healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in two studies with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma during which the patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main inde@@ er for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete dis@@ healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in total 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ian ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a complete withdrawal rate of 66 % to 80 % for patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ otic , non hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ac@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immune competent adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) take up and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue to continue until all the visible f@@ eig@@ ns in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al@@ area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per course period .
inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment process should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammation occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up exam@@ inations lasts for 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions could only be completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been dropped , the patient should apply the cream when he noticed it and then proceed to the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the pur@@ ified , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ fied skin area until the cream is completely covered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should take a decrease in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible confusion of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be a decrease in these patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treating a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible organ shock or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other studies in which no daily pre@@ authentic@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and a case were observed with one to the circumcision .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation have been observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases , where such reactions had occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itate an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ fication in the genital - and peri@@ an@@ al@@ area have so far been no clinical experiences yet .
limited data suggest an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ n reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a smaller effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the removal of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ fication .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair approach has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s complaints , or because of sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
clinical results of therapy can be assessed according to the re@@ generation of treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment .
as there are currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered super@@ vis@@ aged bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , so the use of previously treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a less@@ er probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute kern@@ els on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the eye area inside the Lip Aug@@ r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ian ker@@ at@@ os in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions are frequently occurring , but these reactions take normally in the course of therapy to intensity or go back to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions may cause big dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acquis@@ itions demonstrated a lower full healing rate compared to patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
out of animal studies no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fo@@ etus development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither according to one @-@ time top@@ ical use qu@@ anti@@ fied serum ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period .
the most commonly used and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of F@@ eig@@ n ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
to the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints in the application ort with an incidence of 2@@ 8,1 % .
the effects of patients treated by I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream @-@ treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III were shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with these studies were a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects that were treated from 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical study , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently shows a three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently to local skin reactions , including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , Ex@@ k@@ ore@@ ation / She@@ ets ( 14 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this according to investig@@ ating clinical signs indicate that in these studies with the five @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it is very common to severe er@@ y@@ ways ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and heavy ero@@ sion ( 19 % ) .
clinical trials used by I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was determined by an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment agency or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental unique oral recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od equal to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which stood up after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after or@@ aler or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid input .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , the top@@ ical concentrations of the Alpha@@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 appro@@ ving relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a full healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ od treatment has been superior to a placebo @-@ treatment for 16 weeks .
at 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated patients the F@@ eig@@ n was complete ; this was the case at 20 % of 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
full participation was achieved at 23 % by 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the goals were hist@@ ologically confirmed by the primary super@@ fixed cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data suggest that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients remained clin@@ ically grown and this would stay for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treated free period , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a co@@ her@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 sized treatments than on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the results data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ r@@ v@@ rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trials after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ches , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where dos@@ ages did not be shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ s 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated semi @-@ value period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour semester time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; it points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od showed to top@@ ical application of patients at age 6 - 12 years , and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ak@@ ine ker@@ at@@ ose or super @-@ determined bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milk weight ; also a four months long conducted study on the painting application revealed no similar effects on the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mal@@ ign@@ ant dos@@ ing by three days per week induced no tum@@ ours to the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for human exposure is very low .
the tum@@ ours appeared in the group of mice that was treated with the effective @-@ free cream , previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzymes in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ co@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , g@@ ags ) are not dismant@@ led and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage this damage .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , st@@ iff joints , the movements harder , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who owns experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ alizing units , and patients need to prevent allergic reaction in certain circumstances .

the study was mainly examined the safety of the medicine , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by reducing its effects in terms of the concentrations in urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
at the end of the study , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me became the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , arth@@ rop@@ o@@ arthritis ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update every year all new information that may be announced , check this summary required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. Company granted approval for the transport system of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for the long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a physician who owns experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in individual steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specially these patients should continue to be monitored , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment , in the revival of medical emergen@@ cies .
owing to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , normally within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when treated by al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
having little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk reaction , a hyper@@ ten@@ derness reaction should be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ rene ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was to be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in the rate of in@@ fusion when the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
in@@ fusion can be recorded with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the rate of in@@ fusion when the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the rate of in@@ fusion in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with intra@@ ocular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
as there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , is recommended to satisfy during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants of 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often performed following the following frequencies : ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial skin ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug @-@ effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been reported during a phase 2 patients with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 , with mainly heavy loads and duration of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version in 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a heavy running form , mostly within a month to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or until an early retirement of the study ) were observed in 13 / 45 patients not by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ aus@@ zip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients , with which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low antibody levels have a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res a variable reduction by G@@ ag was determined in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low @-@ neutral inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the urine .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions were typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies .
the reasons for en@@ act@@ ate therapy is in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about man@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients ranged from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient presented the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ route in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the placebo group to improve the lung function and the capability to see which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clinical not significantly and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .

within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease presentation between the patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end@@ point variable , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
one year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was evaluated in 20 patients at the time of its inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy duty @-@ form and 4 with the middle @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dose was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the Har@@ n in Week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the middle @-@ run form had a normal spiritual development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development were determined .
in a phase 4 study tests on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who represent difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the drug features will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to the patients with older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( any other medicines for cancer ) , if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ eable . ( if the cancer is not removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant , cancer has already been spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell lung cancer that cannot attack the cell epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously have previously applied other chemotherapy alone .
to reduce adverse effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , or according to the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or occur in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be suspended , decre@@ asing or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes to cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active agent in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in treating non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( other medicines against cancer ) were compared with chemotherapy .
A@@ lim@@ ta has also been compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( other medicines for cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,3 months at the sole appointment of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
patients who previously received chemotherapy had previously received an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7,9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients with which cancer was not attacked by the epithel@@ ium cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to compar@@ ative treatment .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. approval for the transport system of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole of the European Union .
each female bottle has to be dissolved using 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % of sodium chloride injec@@ tion@@ - solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the water bottle and is diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ oral cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single bron@@ ch@@ oral cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes a day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate have to be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also have to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose , and after each third operation cycle .
in patients suffering from p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , each gift should complete a complete blood image , including differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a plat@@ el@@ ic story .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose examination takes place under rec@@ ir@@ ation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood bil@@ oba or the maximum non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity of the pre@@ heated therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to hints in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 , which are applicable to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient is worth the treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 dose reduction , hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increased secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , patients with a cancer in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min are not necessary to go out dos@@ ages for all patients recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or tran@@ sam@@ ine values of &gt; The 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lic count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ s , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ds and maximum non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a less@@ er tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity like ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients need to be used to apply fol@@ ate and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney disease ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) must be used for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ fulness ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid flow collection , a drainage of the result should be considered before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of the non @-@ oxid@@ ants ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
because the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive re@@ productive capacity is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment of g@@ inn , advice regarding sper@@ mac@@ ros .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed tor@@ sion with the result of a increased rise of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ ful lasting 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is present with N@@ SA@@ IDs as well as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the irrit@@ ation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy takes an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient en@@ du@@ bi@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when pregnant , but like an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during an application in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except for the needs of the mother and risk of use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive re@@ productive capacity is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out on the treatment course , advice regarding the lock ser@@ mon .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the breast milk and unwanted effects may not be excluded in inf@@ ant inf@@ ant .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an anti @-@ anti@@ l@@ astic anti@@ fol@@ ate that inter@@ rup@@ ts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ tured met@@ abolic processes which are necessary for the cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets of attack is blocked by the thy@@ mid@@ yl@@ at@@ synthes@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( UN@@ HC@@ s ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ land and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ds .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated with mal@@ oc@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients an clin@@ ically significant advantage of median survival compared to such patients only with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( p@@ ains and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were caused by improving the lung function in AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function throughout the time .
a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC to previous chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

it is used with an over@@ weigh@@ ted adult with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , gre@@ asy eating diet .
patients who can take all@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks should be addressed to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , some fats can not be abol@@ ished in food , causing a quarter of the fats associated with food in@@ digest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg , compared to placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no longer could be observed for the patient &apos;s weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , leaving secondary sections ( threads ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ s@@ ine ( to prevent the organs of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( if not enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( one liver illness ) , and with pregnant mothers .
July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to grant approval for the settlement by Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the whole of the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ic , gre@@ asy eating diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and you@@ ths under 18 , as not enough data for efficacy and safety .

the probability of getting gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat meal or gre@@ asy eating nutrition .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can go with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who should consult a medicine with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with omni@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist should be adjusted .
patients who should use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dos@@ ing of this medicine must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug effects as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ s@@ in was observed a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ ate plasma membrane .
with the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at were the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the norm range .
however , the patients should be recommended to intake a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin@@ ate ( see section 4.4 ) before bed@@ time .
following the gift of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , at a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at once , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ation was observed .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of taken @-@ taken fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( incidence of available data not predictable ) .
the frequency of known side effects , which were noted after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is unknown , since these events were voluntary from a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to people with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings .
there were either no side effects or similar effects following the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dos@@ ing were reported either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations on human and animal , a rapid recovery of system@@ ic effects , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ pas@@ cal properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed .
therapeutic effect sets up in the l@@ umen of magnesium and the upper small intest@@ ine due to co@@ her@@ ent li@@ aison to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ less li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at were taken three times daily , which blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 take the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , gre@@ asy eating diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of mar@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as alter@@ ation of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of the study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction of over 12 months was observed in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total ch@@ ol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the most common side effects depend on the effects of the capsules together , resulting in causing fat@@ ness out of the body .
these side effects occur usually within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not yet reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ize the nour@@ ished esc@@ ents : • Beg@@ inner for a few days or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al nour@@ ishing diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite star@@ ters and over the size of serv@@ ings you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that you exceed your grease limit . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a rich main court or a con@@ serving night &apos;s weight , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction , study these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Keep drug for children in@@ accessible . • You may not apply al@@ i after the exp@@ iry date of the exp@@ iry date . • Don &apos;t keep the container ti@@ ghtly closed , in order to preserve the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed container with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
if you do not swal@@ low this on no case . • You can lead your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this package .

Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since the effects in this age group cannot be enough information .
this means that the active ingredient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , chemotherapy with chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
for chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate discharge of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron these values fell 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the Company in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . an approval for the transport volume of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ aking chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy because of a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ et age , patients should be monitored using an@@ am@@ anic Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or Sig@@ ns of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection valve .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able with drug substances that leng@@ then the QT interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is leng@@ th@@ ened or which tend to be an extension .
in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics @-@ gift , Alo@@ xi should be used in the days following chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ep@@ ine , hi@@ ox@@ et@@ ic@@ in , hi@@ rel@@ ine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies may not be used , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to be treated by the doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with Alo@@ xi were related to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions in place of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events were observed as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume is a di@@ aly@@ sis , however , no effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind@@ ed chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , treated with patients , which was 32 mg on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half time 7.3 hours ) , which was given in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , plus 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients who were given 32 mg on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given in day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with extremely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
clinical studies of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval , comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical investigations Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation , and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption According to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift is followed by an initial decrease in Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average season of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ Main ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dos@@ ing range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ ) in healthy and cancer patients .
after an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average of 11 patients was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma distribution at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations emerges that at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total figure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) that was measured according to one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dos@@ ing of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ max was compared to the one @-@ time value of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated from the kidneys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary metabolism , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ ites have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a less@@ er degree that are involved in the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous membrane injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver function , termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . pre @-@ clinical studies show evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and can extend the action duration .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30 @-@ fold of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to an increasing frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ma ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , out@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is used for unique application , relev@@ ance of these results will be low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of hepatitis C was intended for the treatment of hepatitis C using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Alph@@ eon like a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A to be similar to the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alph@@ eon should use chronic hepatitis C for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damages , in addition , the values of the Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced that stimul@@ us to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon submitted data before the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient , composition , and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus referred to in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non business , only , What were the biggest concerns caused by CH@@ MP to disp@@ atch the CH@@ MP ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , concerns about the stability of the substance and the market @-@ to @-@ market drug may not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was flamm@@ able in more patients than the reference agent ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was used in the study to examine the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for treatment of im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a cr@@ ushing skin infection ) and small infected in@@ car@@ cin@@ ations ( cra@@ ck or cutting ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections , demonstr@@ ably caused or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go doesn &apos;t work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients over the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not addressing two or three days , the physician should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ els , which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main inde@@ er of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was aver@@ ted after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
regarding the treatment of infected hoods , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contact : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients were treated to treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found during the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ground @-@ filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been pro@@ vable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections prevail against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for the transport system of Al@@ tar@@ go into the whole of the European Union .
the patients , where no improvement is shown within two or three days , should still be examined and considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensiti@@ zation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected passage .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma devices that were reached after top@@ ical use on the poor skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , an clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C increased ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments not be kept , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies have shown a reproduction yel@@ icity of oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate relating to a statement on the birth and the sol@@ der / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to present a system@@ ic anti@@ biotic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / termin@@ ated / termin@@ ated on the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is between the benefit of nursing inf@@ ant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have been used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the meeting was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ious substances .
data indicate that the connection point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred centre .
due to bonds to this relationship , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred , partial P @-@ bind@@ ings inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of more active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the resistance of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should at least appear at least some inf@@ ect@@ ations , a consulting should be executed by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity levels compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( like PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults was raised 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve every day under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma samples were gained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ano@@ inting oil ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP suspension .
metabolism In vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es has been medi@@ ated primarily through CY@@ P3@@ A4 , under minor participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ core test to in @-@ vivo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female patients at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure has been reached as the highest estimated exposure of people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) :

Ambi@@ rix will be used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between the age of 15 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used within two doses existing vacc@@ ines , whereas protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vacc@@ ines can be led to an end from two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contri@@ buting to the immune system ( the natural man of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as licensed vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and the vaccine approved vaccine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one out of three doses existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data provided by the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults also as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ er for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ bodies for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix had led a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti@@ bodies against hepatitis A and B .
the extra study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions and at a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
the most common side @-@ side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain on the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix is allowed to react to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to active substances , one of other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ x@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole of the
the standardi@@ zation board with Ambi@@ rix is made of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose is administered .
if you wish to vacc@@ ination for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination dose .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) virus values are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not completely secured whether immune kno@@ wle@@ d@@ geable persons , which have been addressed to a hepatitis C vaccine , as it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory through immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction , medical treatment options should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation is recommended using the combination dose , which contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combined Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ h@@ bs occurs , so in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal imports , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can come into in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with a combined mask m@@ umps which was administered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that has been crossed with 3 vacc@@ ination of these form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache , and fever , comparable to the incidence that was observed in former thi@@ omer@@ ic and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants in the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and correc@@ t@@ ness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of test subjects according to the gift of a 3 @-@ doses of combination .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects that had given Ambi@@ rix had been given , over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the frequency of Mat@@ ness , however , was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects that received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6,2 % for the test subjects received the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and con@@ dens@@ ation was low and comparable to the combination of combination with 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ines .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x group was similar to that with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combined Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , there was a frequent occurrence of pain ( on the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reports .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combined hepatitis B vaccine , was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical studies that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a similar study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination of combination with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was chosen , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher for Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical study study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , impul@@ ses were either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ in@@ ema with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ in@@ ema with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of the gr@@ ass@@ ment between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ bodies could be detected after at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ines .
the immune response was observed in this study against both anti@@ gens , which was form@@ ulated after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of combination , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units and 10 µ@@ g of combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ bodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ination .
when the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second @-@ year @-@ old was administered at the rear @-@ ch@@ imp@@ fung of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ cer@@ um type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ R@@ öt@@ eln vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current form@@ ulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions such as the former wording .
the vaccine is available both before and after the result , by an eye on a foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus / is ( although you can &apos;t feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , respir@@ atory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If with you / your child has occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B , i.e. within 6 months and before the custom@@ ary adoption of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of a combined hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface ( hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine , with reduced content of effective stock , is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination before finishing the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is spra@@ yed in people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots that are weak@@ ened under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense / or if you / your child is moving to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child take another medicine / take ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without a prescri@@ ption ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated / Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) / or that is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and different limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , ambient pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given enough , except it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other parts of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccine , please contact your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 vacc@@ inated doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort in the feeding point or redness • Mat@@ ri@@ bility • In@@ fertility • App@@ ear@@ ache

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package directions .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since issu@@ ance of the initial approval , the CH@@ MP re@@ signed the view that the benefits of benefits for ambi@@ ence remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine was limited due to its low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ite can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete en@@ cephal@@ opathy or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ak@@ concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ite is served - split by multiple individual doses to meals - swallowed under food , or accompanied by a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach ) or a Nas@@ al onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there was no comparable study since ammon@@ ite could not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( a p@@ seudo @-@ medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ite may also cause irrit@@ ation loss , abnormal acid loss in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ather@@ ability , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ comfortable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ite is effective in patients with disorders of the urea cycle .
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients where a complete en@@ cephal@@ ic organ has already been manifest@@ ed in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete en@@ z@@ ym@@ ity , which manifest itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using protein tolerance and for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg , and with growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthes@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an in@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ synthes@@ ized deficiency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , when the tablets do not arrive immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which equ@@ ates the maximum daily dose .
hence , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ed con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and furn@@ itu@@ itary clinical conditions only be applied with caution .
because Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out on the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed friction of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain @-@ growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by people in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during a stand@@ still period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an unlikely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ sh@@ azi@@ z , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
the case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ ing lim@@ it@@ ox@@ icity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous dos@@ ing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound associated with glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
o@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ concentrate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced .
it is of importance that diagnosis is early pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ect , and the disease did not lead to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue during the first year of life .
due to hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated diet and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids ( however , it was possible to increase survival rate to 80 % within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and that were treated even before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ aller@@ scar@@ city bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are already hardly reversible in treatment and some patients may have further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is contam@@ inated with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abolic in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a standardized single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma core of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were noted .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , there is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma following the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , re@@ treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally taken ( infants and children who have no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or given to a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a Nas@@ al onde .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg , and with growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ in amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum samples in the plasma should be kept within the normal area .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthes@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which equ@@ ates the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ de@@ tles were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain .
an unlikely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ sh@@ azi@@ z , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
o@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are already hardly reversible for treatment , and in some patients an additional wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
after a standardized single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma core of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were noted .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
at this procedure , the small spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
patients with these rare diseases are lacking certain liver enzymes , so that they can accum@@ ulate toxic waste products that accum@@ ulate in body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have any other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , reflection of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms can be found immediately with your doctor or the emergency @-@ recording of your hospital for applying an appropriate treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients suffering from a PCI is given a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in some gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
while PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a clas@@ p ) and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - to prevent new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI was angi@@ ox regarding all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart inf@@ ect .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin in the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission of The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd submitted an approval for the transport system of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during an emergency access or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI can re@@ produce the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ gift by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be eff@@ ected .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and used to be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function limit ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT score 5 minutes after second bolt dose once again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment when aver@@ aged 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of the molecular Hep@@ arin .
• unknown hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ og@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly cereb@@ ral isch@@ ium . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though in PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding occurs on the arter@@ ial points of points , in patients suffering from a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment is generally occurring everywhere .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is expected back to the treatment of existing levels .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation@@ em@@ em@@ mer ) can assume that these substances could increase blood pressure .
with the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis are regularly observed in any case .
in terms of impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or the post@@ nat@@ al development are in@@ adequate ( see section 5.3 ) .

the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn out slowly the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , causing the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regul@@ ate glucose ( sugar ) or ins@@ ulating insulin .
insulin b@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly in human beings , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work duration than a moment@@ ous human .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main inde@@ er for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentrations amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly excessive ( allergic ) to insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the transport system of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or tam@@ s@@ ine or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal bags .
owing to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin levels , the insulin requirement may be reduced to patients with restri@@ ction of liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin @-@ insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or production method can move a change in insulin .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or removal of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and may be necessary to change the dosage .
the time of emergence of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the drug profile of the insulin and can therefore change the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase blood sugar levels and ampli@@ fy the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , angi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme , ox@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biotics .

it is not known if isl@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither in breast milk , nor is it used according to oral application .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is disp@@ at@@ ched to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection of injection can occur in a sequence of lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with in@@ som@@ nia can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating periph@@ eral glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ze of insulin delivery occurs rapidly and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em regular .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin produced in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing range , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glucose level effect , just like human@@ eness .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as a normal human@@ eness and achieves the full glucose level for about 2 hours earlier than human@@ eness .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached as with a human regular , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
if insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was ge@@ ared 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control was given as with human normal , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as in human normal , the 2 Mi@@ - N@@ oves before the meal is reached ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in administration 2 minutes ( previously ) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human regular , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ ice that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
