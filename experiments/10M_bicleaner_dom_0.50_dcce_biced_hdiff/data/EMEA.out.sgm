<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. vortex thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder in which the patient manic episodes (periods of abnormal atmosphere) are alternately with a periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abiilify is used to treat moderate to severe Manic episodes and to measure manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioral disorders, if the oral ingestion is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to capture or processed tablets in patients, which determine the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the same as Abiilify, the dose of Abiilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitter" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipezol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abiilify, the repetition of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to increased unrest, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abiilify was compared with twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abiilify and placebo to reoccur in 160 patients with whom the manic symptoms had been stabilized with Abiilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abiilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which resulted in increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to study how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb (intake).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection-solution showed patients who received Abiilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significant reduction in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abiilify in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abiilify prevented the revival of Manic episodes at previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abiilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), sewer, Nausea (dizziness), vomiting, Nausea (dilapse), relief, Nausea (dilapse), fatigue and exhaustion, sleep disorders, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the conclusion that the benefits of humaneness (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of schizophrenia and from medium to heavy manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol, against the risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioral disturbances in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable towards the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the transport of Abiilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a daily allowance of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors justify these (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripipezol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suiciary behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder did not increase the risk of suicide by using Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, heart failure, overhead disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are applied to hypotonia (dehydration drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials mentioned a year or less, there was occasional reporting during treatment with Aripiprazol occurring Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">When treated with ABILIFY, patients and symptoms of a Spätdyskunesia should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient sign signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with anarchy in the Anamnese or at conditions that are applied with calamity cases in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripipezol associated with patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripinezol, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Aripinezol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazitin or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients suffering with atypical antipsychotic substances, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic substances treated patients who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyurie, Polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Manie due to the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system caution is advisable if Aripiprazol can be taken in combination with alcohol or other central realistic medicines with excess side effects (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have, and therefore similar dosing reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma devices of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extendization.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should not exceed the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-proteases, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dosing reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After deducting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors you should increase the dosage of ABILIFY to the dosishheight from the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical trials showed doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the Metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextrometamoran / 3-methodology morphine), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omedozol) and 3A4 (dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "due to the insufficient data situation on the human being, and due to the concerns caused by animal studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotics the patients should be warned, hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients with Aripiprazol were treated with a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parcsonism, acathisie, dystony and dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripinezol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manical episodes at Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term development phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory tests occurred, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of Cpk (creatine Phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, Spätdyskinesia and Critic attacks, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since market launch were unintended or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information about the efficacy of a hemostalysis is found in treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely to have hemostatic in the treatment of an overdose of use since Aripiprazol has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is communicated to the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a, and 5HT7-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 norepellent and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dosing-dependent reduction in the relationship between 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at Putame.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one Haloperidol controlled trial, 52 of the proportion of the responsibility was observed in week 52, in both groups similar to study medication (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement scales, which were defined as secondary courses, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was reduced from at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over a placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol pointed out 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic traits, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo in regard to preventing a bipolar back, primarily in prevention of a bipolar rear.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP6 enzymes and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for dehydration and hydroxyfication of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyture is catalyed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of the elimination time is nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazol using CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'Poor') Metabolites about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and also showed gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving human liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproduction, delotoxicity and canerogenous potential, the pre-clinical data could not detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study were randomised to 508 men, and 185 patients were evaluated by BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% for Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% for placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), once an annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once-weekly gift from Alendronat, in comparison to the percentage change of Lendenvortex-BMD, compared to the initial value of 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone of Aclasta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed morse Paget of the bone (medium serum-mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to 2,6x to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg eoledron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of crayric acid once daily has been demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed compared to the starting value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified by the end of the six-month main study as a responsibility (on therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients with Aclasta and 107 patients with Risedronat, the therapeutic approach was achieved at 141 who treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 the patients treated with Risedronat, in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes persisting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosed independently.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma mask rapidly decreased from &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphashic vanishing from the large cycle with half-end times t ½ α 0.024 and t ½ h 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale Eliminationshal period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) will represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmaoncentration against Time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of mettochrome P450-Enzymers of metabolized substances is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized with humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or misreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of creatinine Clearance, and amounted to 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">Hence, a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to a creatinine-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosing adjustment of the Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">For heavy kidney problems (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are possible, these population are no statements possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without any renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In clinical studies with intravenous application was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that is administered in intervals of 2 times (a cumulative dose, which is used in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, referred to AUC, corresponds to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with accumulated expertise, the maximum of intended human exposure sufficiently exceeded, toxic effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as in the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common cause of studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a report which reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, one of the rats observations of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was characterised as a result of a severe serum-calcium-mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Beurination Report (EPAR), which is explained as the Committee on Human Medicines (CHMP), in order to provide recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monootherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients). • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (therapy medicine).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), the metformin can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphate resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulphate resin or insulin can be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphate resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and decelerates blood sugar levels, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients, the effectiveness of acetate in tripleotherapy, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa dye, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">The account led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible that blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripleotherapy study, the effect of the additional treatment of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulphate resin in a lowering of the HbA1c values by 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who had an addition to insulin, a lowering of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took in addition placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were sight disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoazione (high level of ketonization - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is used as part of a monotherapy (in the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients with which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to provide approval for the account of Actos in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and bear on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" ACTOS. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate for those metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decomcompensated heart failure should begin to start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or odema, especially those with reduced cardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and odema, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about congestive heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to the 3-fold of the standard range, the liver values are soon to be used as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">In case patient symptoms developed on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, colonoselessness, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn are the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be conducted by clinical assessment as well.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dosing-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stir in fat deposits and is connected to some cases with liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodielution in therapy with Pioglitazone a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparatively controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hematocytant in 3-4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction of hematology (1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity consists of patients, the Pioglitazone as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfa dye or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">According to the market launch, thiazoldIndionen, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic maculaödema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of maculaödema to be aware of the possibility of a maculaödema if patients report about disturbance of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summing analysis of messages undesirable events in fractures, controlled, double-blind clinical studies have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient desire a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is decreasing (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenycoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporine, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reductaids are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor), it resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to due to treatment with pioglitazone, which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistence of the parent and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; sometimes &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents went out to the threefold threshold of the standard range equally, such as placebo, but less commonly used in comparison groups under metformin or sulphate harp.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzv.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported via heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more frequently when Pioglitazone has been applied in combination with insulin or patients with congestive heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">In summary, an overall analysis of messages undesirable events were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 year current PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">After taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears on an activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferator and Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which results in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and peripheral Glucoseversion in the case of insulin resistency.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study conducted with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as a monotherapy has been carried out over two years to investigate the period of therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated under Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate, despite threimonatized optimum phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who remain only insulin; a reduction in insulin treatment was observed in the patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine quintents compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, based on type 2 diabetic examination in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol and small, however, clinically significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found under Pioglitazone no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol while under metformin and Glicfoliage were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved also the postprandial triglyceride mirror, this has a effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcomes study, 5238 patients were randomized in groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment, either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly with the top concentration of unchanging Pioglitazon in the plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, M-IV contribution to efficacy in about the triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenycoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor), the plasma shop of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactive Pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the rotum (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of unchanging Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and all of the active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma production of Pioglitazone and its Metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced renal function, but resemble the oral Clearance of the parent substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed to be repeated by Plasmasts, anemia, and reversible heart hypertrophic.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to this due to treatment with pioglitazone, which reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistence of the parent and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the rat of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urethra epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family-adenomatous polyposis (FAP) treatment with two other thiazolidindions lead to an increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with Pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quintents compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, this has an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatic Tryglizumd synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronarisation, stroke, acute Koronarisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries that are related to taking Pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immune suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always retain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the engaging control of a medical profession (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosisations must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The Dosage of Advaginal Should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of shock and tolerability in individual cases and bleeding (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the conversion of Prograf on Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure measured as a human mirror, comparable to both formulations both at renal and lebertransplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks of transplant under Advaginal, to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls from the Tacrolimus Talmud during the first two weeks of transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf on Advaginal, Dosage adjustment, changes to immune suppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus thoroughbred concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advaginal has a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Steady State joined.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the view mirror of Tacrolimus are usually in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for adrenal and heart-transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Normally, blood concentrations were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml during the following treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1439">It has led to serious adverse events including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in a result of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>

<seg id="1442">On the prophylaxis of grafts with adult heart transplant receptors and transplant receptors in infancy are still no clinical data for retardized formulation Advaginal raf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum) may include, or other plant enhancers during treatment with Advaginal raf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful surveillance of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood level can be subjected to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed as cardiomyopathy and observed the chamber or septic hypertrophic, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver disorders, infections, liquid exposure and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuressiva the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions by suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolon or methylprednisolon, like it is used by acute immune reactions, may increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Impact of Tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicines of Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus can be metabolized using CYPA4, which may affect metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus downfall the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increasing the hormone exposure, it is particularly careful with decisions on receptive contracting measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of grafts in grafts patient provide no indication that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuressiva, there is an increased risk of undesirable events with regard to the course and the outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk and considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">So the CHMP has on the basis of the security film of ADVATE, which makes an submission of PSURs every 6 months required, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially shared the Committee on Humanism for Human Use (CHMP), that the company takes its application for the transfer of Advantto for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bone or the soften parts (tissue which connects other structures in the body, surrounds and leans).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that there can be a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "in the virus in Advexin, it is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been changed so that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger for humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could then be injected directly into the tumours and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein which is produced from the not defective in the human body, usually contributes to restoring damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein isn't right, and the cancer cells may grow further and share themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study of a study involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the company's answers to the questions, there were still some questions.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents the CHMP has been created on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not adequately proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore gains advantages for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration, and the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that Advantin can be established in a reliable manner, and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company won't inform the CHMP whether the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or" "" "Commis@-@ Use" "" "programs with Advexin." ""</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonally allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nostrils (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nostrils (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the alterations of the hypocrisy symptoms, which were reported in the treatment before treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hypocrupfensysymptoms except the blockage of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze's income, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% of the patients, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-mucosa has been viewed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% against 26.7% in the patient that the loratadine alone took.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speediness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity, aspiration, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders, and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be sensitive to patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients that are not used to treat allergies or lauatadine (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients with patients (hypertension), cardiovascular disease (hyperthymus), cardiovascular disease (hyperthyroid), cardiovascular disease (hyperthyroid), or having a risk of hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemic stroke) or having a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted an approval for the Intraders of Aerinaze in the whole of the European Union on 30 July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is in the whole to swallow (i.e. without them to crumble or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data to inconsistency and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after detailing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as at long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine also contains contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine, pergolid, lurydroergotamin, dihydroergotamin, dyydroergotamin, dyylephrine, ephylephrine, ephedrine, napmetazolin, naproolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective, and the data will not suffice to address respective recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function problems, and the data will not suffice to address respective recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treating a hypertension or tachometer, heart rhythm disorders, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or loss of other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a reinforcement of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of following patient groups: • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, bladder, and bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamine may otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce to extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with desloratadin, which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the Plasmaoncentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences between those treated with desloratadine and placebo could be detected, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconsistency of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and at the basis of vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should however be clarified that in very rare cases, it may result in excessive tolerability of transport and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS voice (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, weak miction, muscle weakness, arousal, arrhythmia, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, cordious pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disorders, hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS voice is particularly likely, as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil rigid and dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastics / basophiles as well as blocking of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study involving adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes, including the amplification of subjective protection or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects such as increasing blood pressure, a tachometer or manifestation of a CNS detection.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1.248 patients received seasonal rhinitis in the age between 12 and 78 years, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminant effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall cores for the symptom (except nasal smutilation), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets in regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal snatal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers for 14 days, the total surface of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine has been reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic study study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, was noted that four subjects disloratadine were poorly changed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine in biofuel was the exposure of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, to reduce toxicity and reproduction, the pre-clinical data with desloratadin cannot be recognized for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>

<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, alcohol does not amplified the most effective impact of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should however be clarified in fact that it may result in very rare cases that lead to impairment of transport and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients suffering from patients suffering from placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly found side effects that was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue (1,2%), oral dryness (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">At a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect, this occurred at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastics / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelialcells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically significant cardiovascular effect on a clinical study of up to 20 mg. daily in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no extension of the QTc-interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study involving adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes, including the amplification of subjective protection or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Nieses, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacrience and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As the basis of the overall cores of questionnaire was shown in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminishes the load caused by seasonal or allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was also examined for further forms of the Urbaria, since the underlying Pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology, is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited easier prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all urticular illnesses, it is expected that desloratadine is also carried out in other forms of the Urtikaria to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with desloratadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and watchfulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which were comparable to patients with the general seasonal rhinitis population was achieved in 4% of the patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible has not yet been identified so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (oily, low-calory breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out with the desloratadine and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profiles of the Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, delotoxicity and reproduction, the pre-clinical data with desloratadine can be seen in no particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and priesaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data suggest using an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies should play a role in the diagnosis of the Anamnese, physical studies and related laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize desloratadine constrained and experienced a higher substance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized - is identical to those with children who metabolize normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or a Saccharase Isomaltas- insufficiency this medicine may not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole have been given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinically-pharmacological study, alcohol does not amplify the most efficient impact of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total rigidity of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group like the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients suffering from patients suffering from placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, up to 45 mg desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who came to an antihistamine therapy in question, received daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children can be similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>

<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which can be taken twice daily with 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of ascease is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV volume in combination with other antiviral drugs in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1912">This with low dossified Ritonavir increased medicines Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who used formerly Protease inhibitors, compared with other Proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indeer for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-demonstrable concentration of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had no protections had taken, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but of the children who had previously been treated with Proteasism, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had previously been treated with Protease inhibitors, the viral load increased as effective as 16-week treatment as effective as other Proteasants:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients suffering from HIV that was resistant to four other protections, it came to a stronger bloc of Viruslast after four weeks than in the patients who further took their previous protections:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) to amoxavir or other components.</seg>

<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asendase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protections were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asendase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to inconsistency and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ammeravir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ammeravir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing dosage for simultaneous administration of amoxavir and Kaletra may not be given, but it is recommended to have a close-meshed surveillance, since the efficacy and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study conducted in combination with didanosin combination, but is recommended due to the antacid component of didanosin that the proceeds of didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amoxavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Eanavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protections would be harvested.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteases and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may be sunk into the serum concentration of amoxavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced and possibly subtherapeutic plasma brackets.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are applied together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and astronomical monitoring should be made, as a precise forecast of the effect of combination of amoxavir and Ritonavir to Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amoxavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma cutting (AUC) by Rifabutin to 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin, together with Agenerase, is to be given at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available for this.</seg>

<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are used together with Agenerase, may lead to interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions, which are monitored using these medicines, if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteases, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva, known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amoxavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasma mask of Ammeravir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium-channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipine, Nnidipole, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin, and Verapamil can be increased 10 through Ammeravir, causing possibly the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase, the plasma core can increase considerably and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors in connection to adverse events including hypotension, vision disorders, and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily, together with 50 µg fluticonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate plasma membrane rose by about 86% (90% cone interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not advised along with these glucose levels, unless the potential benefits of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose retracting is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, the proliferation of plasma frames can be expected at the simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma increases of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until the stabilisation of the mirrors, as the Plasmaoncentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by the present gift of Amorphavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral infested Midazolam (see section 4.3) while on the simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protein inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma piekes of Midazolam around the 3-4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with amoxavir, patients should therefore be monitored in Opiatentine symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the slight negligence of historical comparisons can now be given no recommendation, such as the Ammeravian dosage is to be adjusted at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For the present gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, a reinforced control of INR (International normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptiva is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the present gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2033">In the way, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other Proteasants-resistant isolates; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that can affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the section A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis did the non-subsuperiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average speed of the output value (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subtilated wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of efficacy of non-controlled Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously given at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>

<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax is reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amoxavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ammeravir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amoxavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Thus, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the equivalent of dietary intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and allows to close a large distribution volume as well as a impaired penetration of Ammeravir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of non-bound amoxavir, which represents the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amoxavir remains constant, the percentage of the non-active ingredient during dosing intervals in the Steady state concentration on the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals, or inhibitions or inhibitions, or a substrate of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution when they are given at the same time using Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amoxavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amoxavir is made from the solution 14% less bioverseable as of the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a billiard base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be small to the elimination of amoxavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Amorphavir plasmasons comparable to those who are achieved on healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg amoxavir twice daily without a simultaneous cancellation of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for creating hepatobious adenoma and carcinomas has not yet been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, due to the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutic use, however, few hints for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro diagnostics tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), micro-lymphoma test, microcore test of human peripheral lymphocytes included, was amoxavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>

<seg id="2062">However, with a systematic PlasmaDrive, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats), however, a number of minor changes were observed, including thymuselongation and minor skeletal alterations, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of Ritonavir (Boogers), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Ageneric capsules is 20 mg amoxavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amoxavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use of patients with weak or slight liver function should be done with caution, in patients with severe liver function cases, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA-technology using Cho-Mammalogy cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for the long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Muesysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a physician who owns experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in individual steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specially these patients should continue to be monitored, and infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment, in the revival of medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Owing to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all of IgG-antibodies against laronidase are expected, normally within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when treated by aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically elevated risk reaction, a hypertenderness reaction should be cautious after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyrene) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen was to be weighed and / or a reduction in the rate of infusion when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-conditional reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be recorded with a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the rate of infusion when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the rate of infusion in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interference with intraocular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there are no data on newborns that were exposed to Laronidase about breast milk, is recommended to satisfy during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants of 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during phase 3 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often performed following the following frequencies: (≥ 1 / 100); (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, heavy reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial skin (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug-effects associated with Aldurazyme, which have been reported during a phase 2 patients with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5, with mainly heavy loads and duration of up to 12 months, have been reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion in 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, with a heavy running form, mostly within a month to a seroconversion (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or until an early retirement of the study) were observed in 13 / 45 patients not by Radioimmunopauszipation (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, among them 3 patients, with which it never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels have a robust reduction in the gag mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction by Gag was determined in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low-neutral inhibitory effect on the enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of Gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions were typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for enactate therapy is in one for hydrolysis of the cumulative substrats and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, the most likely about manosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients ranged from the mean phenotype and only one patient presented the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute enroute in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group to improve the lung function and the capability to see which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The acceptance of the expected percentage of FEV is clinical not significantly and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomic molecule before treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the Gag levels in the urine (µg / mg Creatinine) was found, which remained constant until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous disease presentation between the patients, which has been taken into account by using a combined endpoint variable, the clinically significant changes for five patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%), and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">One year-old open phase 2 study was carried out in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was evaluated in 20 patients at the time of its inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with the heavy duty-form and 4 with the middle-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dose was increased due to increased GAG- Spiegel in the Harn in Week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-score for this age group. the younger patients with the middle-run form had a normal spiritual development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe expiration form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study tests on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemata were performed on the Gag-Spiegel in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2509">The most common adverse events of alli (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, Flatus (winch) with chair, fetal / oily chair, leaving secondary sections (threads), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclossine (to prevent the organs of transplant patients) or medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (if not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or to cholesterol (one liver illness), and with pregnant mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">July 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited to grant approval for the settlement by Orlistat GSK in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalic, greasy eating diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and youths under 18, as not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since Orlistat however is only minimally resorized, the elderly and / or kidney function is not necessary in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the active agent or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment of Ciclossin (see section 4.6) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of getting gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase when alli is taken together with a fat meal or greasy eating nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can go with improved metabolic control, patients who should consult a medicine with alli a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with omnii a doctor or pharmacist should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who should use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol, should consult their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosing of this medicine must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent severe diarrhoea possible failure of the oral contraception (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug effects as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclossin was observed a reduction of Ciclosate plasma membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2522">With the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat were the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotins in the norm range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patients should be recommended to intake a supplementary multivitaminate (see section 4.4) before bedtime.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the gift of one single dose Amiodarone, at a limited number of volunteers, who received orlistat once, a minor decrease of Amiodaron-Plasmaoncentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of taken-taken fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rare (incidence of available data not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects, which were noted after the market launch of Orlistat, is unknown, since these events were voluntary from a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to people with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg. of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">There were either no side effects or similar effects following the recommended dose of orlistat overdosing were reported either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on human and animal, a rapid recovery of systemic effects, which are attributable to the lipascal properties of orlistat, can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">Therapeutic effect sets up in the lumen of magnesium and the upper small intestine due to coherent liaison to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankreless lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of orlistat were taken three times daily, which blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 take the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with hypokaloric, greasy eating diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change of body weight compared to the output value (at the time of maromization), was evaluated as follows: as alteration of the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a share of the study participants, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of its initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction of over 12 months was observed in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in the LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value: 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In the waist range the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (output value 103,7 cm) and with placebo-3,6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma cutting of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used with chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like cisplatin), as well as for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since the effects in this age group cannot be enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults, chemotherapy with chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapies, the moderate discharge of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi were no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolassetron these values fell 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the Company in Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. an approval for the transport volume of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emaking chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy because of a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the thicket age, patients should be monitored using anamanic Obstipation or Signs of a subacute Ileus after injection valve.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable with drug substances that lengthen the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- interval is lengthened or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with a further chemotherapeutics-gift, Aloxi should be used in the days following chemotherapy neither to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady concentration of Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6-Inhibitors (dexamethasepine, hioxeticin, hireline, Ritonavir, Sertrine and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to use Palonosetron in human pregnancies may not be used, therefore Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women, unless it is necessary to be treated by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly with Aloxi were related to headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive reactions and reactions in place of performance (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of unwanted events were observed as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume is a dialysis, however, no effective therapy in a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blinded chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms / m2 doxorubicin, treated with patients, which was 32 mg ondansetron (half time 7.3 hours), which was given in day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, plus 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients who were given 32 mg ondansetron, which were given in day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with extremely emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Clinical studies of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc-interval, comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dagetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical investigations Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization, and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG effects of I.V. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift is followed by an initial decrease in Plasmaoncentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average season of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum PlasmaonMain (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire dosing range of 0,3- 90 μ) in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average of 11 patients was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma distribution at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations emerges that at once daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total figure (AUC0- ∞) that was measured according to one-time intravenous dosing of 0.75 mg, the Cmax was compared to the one-time value of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated from the kidneys, and about another 50% will be converted into two primary metabolism, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolites have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree that are involved in the metabolism of CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 on the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron about 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours, Palonosetron as an unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous membrane injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver function, terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. pre-clinical studies show evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular De- and Repolarization and can extend the action duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30-fold of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given every day over two years, led to an increasing frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, outnierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the high dosages and since Aloxi is used for unique application, relevance of these results will be low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was flammable in more patients than the reference agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was used in the study to examine the question of how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for treatment of impetigo (a crushing skin infection) and small infected incarcinations (crack or cutting), depreciation and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections, demonstrably caused or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo doesn't work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients over the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing two or three days, the physician should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (parts of bacterienzels, which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indeer of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was averted after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Regarding the treatment of infected hoods, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar contact: when the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was found during the treatment of abscesses (ground-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been provable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation to the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevail against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the transport system of Altargo into the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, where no improvement is shown within two or three days, should still be examined and considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or heavy local irritation by the use of retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be canceled, the ointment should be carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>

<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma devices that were reached after topical use on the poor skin or infected superficial wounds, an clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have been used Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the meeting was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interagious substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the connection point ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-ties and the Peptidyltransferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to bonds to this relationship, Pleuromutiline block the peptidyltransferred, partial P-bindings interactions and prevent normal formation of more active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the local prevalence of resistance to the resistance of retapamulin should at least appear at least some infectations, a consulting should be executed by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity levels compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (like PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults was raised 1% retapamulin Salve every day under occlusion on intact skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin Salve twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma samples were gained.</seg>

<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes has been mediated primarily through CYP3A4, under minor participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be used within two doses existing vaccines, whereas protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vaccines can be led to an end from two doses.</seg>

<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same disease, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one out of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data provided by the application of Twinrix Adults also as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indeer for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibodies for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>

<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization is recommended using the combination dose, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs anti-hbs occurs, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported over severe side effects during the 2-doses of vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-doses-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B vaccine, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, Seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2807">Ammonite can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete encephalopathy or hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniakconcentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is served - split by multiple individual doses to meals - swallowed under food, or accompanied by a gastrostomieschi (through the abdominal wall in the stomach) or a Nasal onde (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparable study since ammonite could not be compared to another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also cause irritation loss, abnormal acid loss in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fatherability, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonite is effective in patients with disorders of the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients where a complete encephalic organ has already been manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzymity, which manifest itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when in the Anamnese a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using protein tolerance and for the growth and development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg, and with growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphatsynthesetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an inininosuccinatsynthesized deficiency need to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulcera, when the tablets do not arrive immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate which equates the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Hence, AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congested congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and furnituitary clinical conditions only be applied with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out on the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed friction of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain-growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is excreted by people in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during a standstill period is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an undesired event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An unlikely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Lakshaziz, Panzytopenia, peripheral Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosing limitoxicity in an intravenous dosing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound associated with glutamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Oylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the uretic cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyconcentrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that diagnosis is early prematurely and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborns was earlier almost always infect, and the disease did not lead to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogue during the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemostalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), proteinated diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids (however, it was possible to increase survival rate to 80% within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and that were treated even before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygallerscarcity bamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonium encephalopathy and were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinreduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are already hardly reversible in treatment and some patients may have further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is contaminated with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate, with liver cirrhosis, and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a standardized single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma core of phenylbutyate were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycles or hemoglobinopathies, according to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), there is no phenylacetate in the plasma following the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, retreated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three individual doses) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either orally taken (infants and children who have no tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or given to a gastrostomieschi or a Nasal onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg, and with growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-in amino acids), carnitine and serum samples in the plasma should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphatsynthesetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate which equates the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattendetles were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An unlikely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Lakshaziz, Panzytopenia, peripheral Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Oylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the uretic cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are already hardly reversible for treatment, and in some patients an additional worsening of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a standardized single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulatform, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma core of phenylbutyate were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">At this procedure, the small spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">Patients with these rare diseases are lacking certain liver enzymes, so that they can accumulate toxic waste products that accumulate in body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have conducted laboratory studies, you must inform the doctor that you can use AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you use AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have any other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, flavours, reflection of the hearing, disorientation, memory problems and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you determine one of these symptoms can be found immediately with your doctor or the emergency-recording of your hospital for applying an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest of chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomalous measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients suffering from a PCI is given a higher dose and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in some gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA-inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp) and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - to prevent new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI was angiox regarding all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infect.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin in the treatment of ACS and a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission of The Medicines Company UK Ltd submitted an approval for the transport system of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (unstable angina / non - ST-Hebungsinfarction (IA / NSTEMI)) during an emergency access or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI can reproduce the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus-gift by Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to below 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be effected.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed and used to be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function limit (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudine against ACS or not), should be used a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT score 5 minutes after second bolt dose once again.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, most bleeding occurs on the arterial points of points, in patients suffering from a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI), while the treatment is generally occurring everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR value (International norm ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bivalirudine is expected back to the treatment of existing levels.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulancia (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocytes aggregationememmer) can assume that these substances could increase blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2910">With the combination of bivalirudin combination with thrombocytes aggregates or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis are regularly observed in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinsideor, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as at the Anionenbindings region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin turn out slowly the binding of bivalirin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, causing the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, Bivalirudine caused by Bivalirudin with serum samples induced in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / hepacininduced throcyte syndrome (HIT / HITTS), which induce throcytes aggregate reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the thigh or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) or insulating insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin bulisin differs very slightly in human beings, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter work duration than a momentous human.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indeer for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentrations amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who are possibly excessive (allergic) to insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the transport system of Apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or tamsine or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal bags.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Owing to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin levels, the insulin requirement may be reduced to patients with restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin-insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or production method can move a change in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or removal of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoazione; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and may be necessary to change the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of emergence of a hypoglycemia depends on the drug profile of the insulin and can therefore change the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar levels and amplify the inclination to hypoglycemics, angioxetine-converting enzyme, oxoxifylline (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphs, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathy, Clonidin, Guanethidin, Guanethidin and reserves can be weakened or missing the symptoms of norepineptions.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproduction and humaneness showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaneness in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if islinglulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is neither in breast milk, nor is it used according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical studies known for which adverse drug limitations are listed, grouped according to systems organically and ordered after decreasing the frequency of their emergence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000,</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is dispatched to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection of injection can occur in a sequence of lipystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemics with insomnia can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous gauze of insulin delivery occurs rapidly and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manem regular.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin produced in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, in the therapeutic relevant dosing range, and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glucose level effect, just like humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as a normal humaneness and achieves the full glucose level for about 2 hours earlier than humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postpranial glycemic control is reached as with a human regular, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin-lulisin was geared 2 minutes before meal, a better postpranial control was given as with human normal, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as in human normal, the 2 Mi- Noves before the meal is reached (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin in administration 2 minutes (previously) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human regular, the 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A), which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
