if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the text URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , you should not make an important decisions on translation , without checking the translation before .
only web sites in the internet can be translated . other texts should translate you on the baby fish site itself , where you can insert texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
further information about using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you will find in the guide to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions .... open the card box tools and select the required modules .
this is a list with standard installation modules from the pack@@ et ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of stor@@ ming , if available , er@@ ase .
the module &apos;s viewing filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras . by the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current work list on different kinds .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M &apos;s root node . as default , the display starts with the root node of document , example : document@@ ing , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root dust .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in forming a shell @-@ called &quot; Tree @-@ Map . &quot; each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size has to possess that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a folder or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily detected , even if they can be seen far in the folder and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you can see .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rec@@ t@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simpli@@ fy navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can represent a depth for the light detection of the dis@@ ables or the figure of another file sel@@ f@@ dom such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if sufficient space is displayed at all , i.e. , if sufficient space for representation is used , so you can specify the relative position of the labels in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in case of performances for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule is observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always maintained , and this framework will no longer be available . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
the implementation is left to implement the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries . here , it is due to the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses incur@@ red by frames that the rec@@ tan@@ gles are created as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimal surface area for an entry via the menu entry . instead , a sample @-@ pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent event , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally was &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed to be developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery you will find in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu with Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .

a video camera is easy to use , so that you can connect with your digital camera and you can download them directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a fast image processing with base processing tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ous ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the resource conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour controls .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ gs ; Programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore contact problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to make the problem of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use the help menu , your web browser will open a page in the error system . all required information is already registered . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; is a project supported by a community . that means , if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; ask for questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; however , if you have questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ ous homepage ; visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ; learn more .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ plug , is registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for not@@ if@@ ications in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ous ;
when you launch &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply type pa@@ ge@@ name or click on the folder symbol folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add so many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ plug , you will also use as an alarm library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folders . no picture will be changed . during the search of the ste@@ wards you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ plug , recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian path in his whole depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folder , unless there was any sub@@ folder . this can be done in a hidden folder . do this by inser@@ tion a point in front of the folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not have photos as symbols . you can change it as an album icon . this is then used as an album icon . further details can be found in the section Albums .
once you configured the Base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should learn to use your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to manage my albums and my stit@@ cher in order to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ag@@ ulation : if you want to use the raw mode of your camera , it can also deal with it . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you &apos;ll find a list of supported rough cameras in the Help &#124; Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ assist .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ mal Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
a video camera is easy to use , so that you can connect with your digital camera and you can download them directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are introduced by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera will also use the camera transfer protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , remote software collection for digital cameras supporting a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports converting images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slowly out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ ous , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug , supports the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to display the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be a thumb@@ nail , or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ous ; self @-@ perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
pulling and dismant@@ ling pictures works everywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , via the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not allowed in keywords , dates or searching .
- a file selection allows you to start wid@@ est : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter will only be used for fields used in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind it is displayed as a symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure the al@@ ben@@ ds dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents a organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single album , where they were created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection , in which the album was first created , sorted by the album , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan up a photo album directly to an album . you can also select a screen@@ shot directly to an album . choose Album Import screen@@ shots .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another album , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then released menu you have to move or copy the picture . you can easily move or copy all photos and move it onto the target album .

Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can select under a common name , if you want to add or delete records from the tool@@ bar or delete records . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums after date with view albums . sort by date .
the buttons oldest , average , latest : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest image or the average of the album . when this strikes first , the date of the last change will be used instead of any file in this folder .
when you first came up an album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; sometimes , this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in one collection and collections can not be st@@ acked away .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the input of keywords in the area of my keyword in the main window . album collections have another effect . you can always use all the photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . every photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two pin buttons in the tool bar .
if you open an album the first time you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image is displayed below the associated preview . which information this , you can change over settings . select the Albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help window that appears . if you leave the mouse cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features , including all tags of a photos . the screen shows in the section introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all that &apos;s about &amp; digi@@ ous ; go . albums and tags will allow you to organize your pictures as it fits . you can reach any number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ al . you can reach the menu menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the pictures , a slide or the editing of the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 or Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a guide as you can edit your photos . with the image processing you can view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ous ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and adjust the program from the sub@@ menu with the right mouse button , and how you will adapt it to your needs if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should be aware that after processing of other image processing programs , you can do so . some programs don &apos;t save this data with the image containing in the image . this information can be lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , Bl@@ end , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; put two options for turning . the easiest is to select and select the right mouse button on the preview . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a picture , you can select the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming out of the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous ; delete , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F8 image del@@ e@@ tion or de@@ f if you prefer to delete it , you can use Shift ; relax .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ d ; organized your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last change of file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the file sheet below in order to be shown only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ist . tags are st@@ ickers , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword is assigned to a picture , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can also arrange your words log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My quotes , so that you can find the tags that you are looking for , easy to find .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . in addition , the tags will be imported to the loss of database re @-@ imported once &amp; digi@@ ous ; the pictures are not@@ ified .
you can add new tags by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you have a new keyword , then click on an existing word , this keyword will be the fore@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword using the right mouse button and select del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be one time in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit it in the context menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
around &amp; digi@@ plug ; s functionality must be used with keywords , you must first select your photos with keywords , as soon as you have chosen the photos with a keyword , then you can see it with a keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; and you can select it with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails , and select from the context menu keyword .
you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you can address one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can see a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , with which it was made , etc .
once you have signed a photo with keywords , this will appear under the image of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the text menu from the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu indicates only the tags that were assigned to the picture .
the time beam view shows a tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ogram of the number of images per time . a selection frame can be postpon@@ ed using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to display the time frame . thus all their images are displayed in the main window .
in the box below you can input a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps , and in the future even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uch@@ in search box is a small lamp , when the search is found . if you click here , the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . when you open this , you can store a simple search box as described above . but you can download this search here as a live search , which has always been filtered as a search crit@@ eri@@ on . after you saved , it was released in the list .

if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters available , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to reset the options for a search request in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ geb@@ ase . all rules can be deleted by operators and deleted . each option can link to other via the logical operations . all rules can be linked with other via the logical operations . furthermore , you can create a type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows to compare it images by compar@@ ing these signat@@ ures . the less@@ ness of the difference between two pictures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar problem . by using a swelling can push the result list . if you push a picture of somewhere over the icon of the un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : drop @-@ hand paint sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug . find the right pictures . even here , a swelling can be set .
this rider puts an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can hold out and move it onto the left mouse button . move it off by clicking the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course putting up your images Ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Ge@@ o@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; introduces a lumin@@ ary table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image files , even raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the light desk to the light menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug , main window , you can open the LEDs fast with L Extras LEDs .
from the thumb@@ nail you can compare the images that you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . if you are able to sync from the tool bar and remove the zoo and shift operations on one of the images , then they will compare these images in the other picture .
another mode is better suited to display quickly from a series of images . if you use p@@ airing mode from the tool bar , then view the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right section . the right next picture is shown in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course , normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the LEDs as well as F4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main plug are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each range , you will find a built @-@ in piv@@ ot function which allows you to swing to the cross@@ roads of the picture . in order to keep the visible range of the image you have to hold them and see the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use zoom @-@ kno@@ b under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse bike to zoom into The picture and out . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory administration looks every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory administration . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ ograph@@ ers that we can use , delete , reset , evaluate , upload , optimize , verify , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory administration occupies , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ized , secure , seeking , transformed , pre@@ assembled and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data containing information about or documentation of other data being managed by an application or environment .
I do not dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have in a database as well as in the image files save very quick searches and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can access with other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know what you need to do in your system . you must decide whether other access@@ ing your photos will have to store if you want to save them on a reser@@ ving drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you need to switch to a bigger drive at some time .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you were able to organize enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then publish a folder for images that you will print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation from original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend metadata in the setup page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can then save the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? and digi@@ plug @-@ Editor is available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now select any photo words , lab@@ eling and review . of course , you can choose the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you can use in other programs , or browse these categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then it is not a problem and can simply insert the images in the correct place . the sort of hier@@ archy inside the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords are pursued by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the sub@@ trees are pro@@ secuted .
the graphics shows how different metadata is over@@ cut . this is a very coar@@ se representation , since each blo@@ c consists of metadata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alog@@ ing your metadata .
you most don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Allied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others viewing your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer him about the viewer you &apos;ve moved to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s ok when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can also use any text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then they will tell you a spell check @-@ in for your wishes and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery .
remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was she not a boring planet from goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation right now with light speed .
the possibilities to explo@@ it the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are inn@@ um@@ erable . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels with ge@@ ographic information . this displays the photos on the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle maps view .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information is found in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onymous for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the camera , and if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name . after that , the name of a company or organization is used , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be the title of a photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a memor@@ and@@ um to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the vend@@ or field to identify who owns the photo agency such as Reuters , or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , the group / agency will offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator is this , in the picture embedded metadata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug , in the near future , there will be such a module for st@@ acking processing .
topics : failure , record failure , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging the storage media , rest@@ oring , redund@@ ancy , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section , things are problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data production company in the world , has some interesting statistics which cause some data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be treated for more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality which are longer expensive and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices , and they are not much more reliable than the cheapest ones , but you write much reliable . so it &apos;s about to select the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to faul@@ ts even if you have just been written only . therefore , use a control environment to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum . despite this massive protection , they use chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs , but there is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to store the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course , applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then in a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of hardware and software that can read this media .
disc@@ othe@@ ques retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ rup@@ ture study
shortly , Dis@@ ks will last the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . some of SM@@ ART may not determine these errors . these are in particular readers and publishing count . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without great problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . they can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect themselves from the in@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and gro@@ unded by the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . remember that not every plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of protection against lighten@@ ing and protects the correctly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also use any periph@@ er@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage c@@ abling , which also includes a phone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable and TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for modem . thus , you are ideal for the go .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines you will not really help you . even an failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in an inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against hyper@@ tension , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy . some models allow you to store your data and run down the system . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your host system is exposed to and compare his safety while avoiding the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be paid for less than &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS . this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you drive to the holidays .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only available as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general securing solution . it &apos;s too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol and include a backup and a distributor stored in the offer . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system calls and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody can tell you when a transmission error occurred to you . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable networks are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seem to be one of two candidates to deal with and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used for and is also available for &amp; Linux . but it &apos;s not part of the core .
not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the job systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it is currently limited to any damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux . no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteri@@ or@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro coins . so do not have anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by one data loss . so , secure your data frequently after a plan and test it before you do something dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or size of hard drives .
suppose you take your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster hits locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the whole house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ation always means not a local store . bring your backup up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy of a time .
differentiation : a backup of files changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two periods : the total securing and the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only ab@@ dic@@ apped and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can set up easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you to discover and restore losses in the same time . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every other di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying the images on the next generation of media , applications , systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
with that valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because you should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predictable for the future because of your nature , you have to consider it all today with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself as the current system goes backwards . the less version you have used in the past , the more easier to rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is currently available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means always enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated sheet or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC # source ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read it , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which disappears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can be so los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata . the down@@ side is that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many management information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format will we recommend to store your images .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression sal@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it is necessary to save your images in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and comm@@ its to use metadata . it is now available on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored in a file itself . the file information is stored in an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers attract it before an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , to archive file . however , it can come to problems with the link between the file file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as containers and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . in addition to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , work and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images are on the camera mode , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your rough archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered process you can use external programs . if you have the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut down under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first in web galleries , add them to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera @-@ interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will find a description as you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your night@@ time database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect this with the computer , turn the camera on display mode and switch them . you will find a further description on the manual of your camera .
when you start camera @-@ interface , it tries to connect with your camera . when the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom of the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol of file assignment will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with side@@ bars Properties and Metad@@ ata from the camera @-@ interface you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata .
this dialog features file features and the photo information to be stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
the rider metadata is showing the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remark , GPS etc of the image . this information is the same as the metadata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available with some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then the selection of all photos . this will download all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . by downloading , the photos will be sure to check if the pictures are securely removed in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you select the photos , use the button Download and then select S@@ elected . the button S@@ elected is extended until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these pictures have been selected until now . in this case , the new pictures are selected by a star in the front panel . if you select this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you want to download or download the buttons , a dialog box will be sorted into which the photos can be stored . the list of existing albums can be sorted , displayed in the section My albums . select the list from the list and press OK .
after choosing the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; invites the photos of the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . if you only want to delete the button , you must select it first and delete the chosen button .
please note that there is no way to recover from the camera , and the photos are not removed in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete the camera memory , you should read it out about the camera memory because this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not very meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ utilized , after the photos of the camera are loaded again . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the photos of various recording criteria into the same album . therefore , it may be useful , the date and time when the image was taken to integrate in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and dat@@ ast@@ al @-@ based sub @-@ bs . if you use this option , will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer will open three more options which will be carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied to the IP@@ TC array . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want another date format than the standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . to add the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the possibility to change the file name in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo used , is shown below the name , which will be displayed under the name . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera &apos;s window .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to carry out an automatic spin during charging . not all cameras are ready . in the section page metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic spin is usually turned on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , and when you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom range of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was done , it can be made available to download on the picture data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section page met@@ a met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option , use the button below and select the option data @-@ based signat@@ ures at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button downloading . then choose up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can choose the files being uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the images will be loaded up . select the folder dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to launch the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . that &apos;s a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers there can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agent can use this ability .
if you forget later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , the user can locate to document the location , or simply want to document the location data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction , saddle and card refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and recently over the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has a GPS unit integ@@ rates . but there are a couple working with GPS receivers . either as card module or via transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save this data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .

the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the respective IP@@ TC rock . this makes the metadata permanently contained in the image and are not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without lost .
save imag@@ inations as embedded labelling ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos with the images embedded in the pictures . please note : in pictures , which are already lab@@ elled , they are over@@ written by the signs .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lamp by &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be set on this site . every time you can open the LEDs . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get a better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool bar when you are working in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this vision mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the close explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this surgery reduces the image quality , because P@@ NG is a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time to spin and packing . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . 1 : low and 9 high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F file , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is not working freely .
with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you have the loss of quality loss and file size far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it has become a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the default time@@ out is that all green pixels are identical to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines . if you use this option , fix this problem with a minimal loss of detail . this option draws the image a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid @-@ pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used immediately . otherwise , when set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white off is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that in four steps received more details into the top @-@ lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are inserted , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top @-@ in white in the settings . last@@ ly , use some unusual findings , because they can construct the top @-@ lights in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the plants .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous therefore try to construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and it should be customized for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you &apos;ll probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should be conservative .
a digital image process is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ w .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ rap@@ w supplies you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) , but it is interesting to look for a quick solution to the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color@@ less correction , as you are carried out during the pipe conversion .
a profile translated the colour information and gives instructions like this one should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ plug . information such as the colour information of a colour space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
when a picture is opened in the image processing , / color management module will start with raw files .
color profile folder S@@ etting the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; check this folder then during the start .
ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the paint administration view is an alternative towards X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ ing not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be made to the camera maker and model you should fit . not all profiles are created on the same way . currently , there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color mapping or G@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ Surgery . this means that you need to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be re @-@ delivered . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very sati@@ ated , instead of converting to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obvious what colour profile is intended for for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ ut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; viewed images and image processing ; many modules support which are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
in case your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . then select a list of available modules . then , these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond that you will also find some in the context menu of the thumb@@ nail .
short commands for assign@@ ments carried out by modules can be set in the menu on Settings Short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can see the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adap@@ ts the time between the image trans@@ itions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other boxes switch on the metadata , or out , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use this camera , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently there are serial settings , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , indicate that you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , to display and switch on display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera amo@@ del and port manually . after reading your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
any way you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera in the menu , you can insert it here .
you can display the talk of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can . you can set the talk about the images in the tr@@ ash@@ can ; in the del@@ eting of a photo in an album . you will find more details when del@@ eting the photos and del@@ eting another album .
the editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without any refund . otherwise , you need to use the changes using the button modifications .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; at Star@@ ts , this acceler@@ ates the start procedure of &amp; digi@@ plug .
setting Bei@@ m start following new photos are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ous ; the basic folders chosen for new or deleted albums / photos . if something was removed from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ ous ; you know if it is to delete it from the base folder .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available design is highlighted below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correc@@ ting and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking on a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit menu .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug . so , they are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar becomes quick access to the most common features .
the editing functions of image processing vary your photos . however , the original photo will change , before you use File Save or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you don &apos;t have the original photo to recover when you have stored the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as you can .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the button restore recovery in the tool bar . then you lose any change that you have been using in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting or restore editing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should do the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to the back@@ bone and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back or restore button in the tool bar , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or recovered .
once you start image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes on the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out zoom in which you are using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode . you come in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t like this , you can start this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can see this as the main window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture you can print in the image file , and get the default &amp; k@@ not ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . you will select only the images with standard methods and select from the Album Export printer . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , even in image processing . it will appear when one of the five riders is clicked :
multiple Click on the same horse@@ man lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edges .
in the labelling view , you can insert or insert the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the button user or simply switch to the next picture , the labels will then be stored .
in addition to the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , it is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section rating shows a document scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the Key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the stit@@ ch tree , and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ous session .
the keyword tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities looking for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when typ@@ ing keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking of the respective boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ password filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , keywords and search results . if necessary , only the cutting rate of these two is displayed . all set keywords are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also tags and drop them . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . after that , a dialog box will ask you if you want to set the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the Key@@ word filter is reduced to no keyword which has been selected by Str@@ g + a . afterwards , a keyword from the right stit@@ ch tree has been drawn and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched on settings below settings .
if you have created and created a rule , and note that it would be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry that is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , that is a name or a string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search about all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then group@@ ing the button . the options look as follows :
why not listed pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store images in full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mostly adapted it &amp; digi@@ ous implementation .
the reason why one is using a color@@ less workflow , you can get the colors made from your camera or scanner that you can get the colors on your monitor or scanner that you may print or publish the colors that you want to print or publish them from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the subject comes on color management , everyone wants to know what kno@@ bs he must press for the results which he would like to press . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to make you adequate background information about color management . in addition , you should make your own information on color management so that you will receive the requested results .
if your imag@@ ery meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about paint management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image expenses are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for all so easy , then why should one use another colour space and make thoughts about paint bu@@ zz@@ ling ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ f@@ isen@@ shaped area , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using a few larger colour spaces , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om and then click Info and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to do my monitor when I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to cope with your monitor , since s@@ RGB uses the circle . when you &apos;re working as in the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool produces five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting to create a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ used , automatic and contrast from the menu , auto @-@ correction attempt to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which seems best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aling on the whole picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sha@@ dy . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
decre@@ asing : this method adju@@ sts the illumin@@ ation factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity can be as flat as possible . sometimes , almost every light range in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces just tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes some miracles in an image or destroyed it .
automatic off : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue canal . it is determined the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a new ji@@ ust@@ ification of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be good correction for bad photos .
the white comparison of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a high @-@ quality photos .
the white @-@ comparison correction is slightly restricted there for a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform too far from the original image . if you can perform the white off in the rough mode , so you will be able to pull off the white mode in the mode mode , so your possibilities will be better out to correction .
this tool is based on a white ab@@ equ@@ in@@ ism protected by the copy@@ righ@@ ted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it via the menu entry colors white off the image processing .
the thumb@@ nail can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and preview of the target image will be adjusted . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish window , then it will be enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
to the right up , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as soon as you can choose one parameter . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow of alignment lets you improve the sha@@ dow@@ els of your photos or di@@ mming down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette to use this button and then click anywhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white ab@@ used . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally , you can set the white off with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ shift indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of pixels is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white comparison . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . every setting of the white ab@@ normal@@ y you can set it in a text file and re@@ charge them later .
the button pre@@ ferences sets all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original . if you store it , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ ary depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . but this encoding also requires more turn@@ tables , calcul@@ ative time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool opens up the same dialog as the processing of images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to rate colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under shades of key correction . this tool provides you with an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error , and you can always find the same correc@@ tions . in the manual for sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects produces four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the extra light . this had the effect that the lighter ranges dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted . this result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar panel . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar eclip@@ se . the original image is ( 1 ) and the edit intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contra@@ sts that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , it emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an enhanced color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as is highly saturated colors , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who have barely visible landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter can take the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to fix the color con@@ tra and lumin@@ ance of your photos with the tools in the menu . as soon as you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the opposite problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce your satur@@ ation instead of increasing . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is based on the exposure of the exposure . even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool , you need only the area of shooting . concrete the three sl@@ ats below the Hist@@ o@@ Program .
the window includes a graph@@ ite of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , an active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sl@@ itting can be changed into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to move the regulator and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be considered . the preview is dynamic , with the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic result is useful .
three kno@@ b : the upper@@ most for the dark tones , medium for light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the shadows , middle and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
application values : the outputs allow manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ b values that can be used to evaluate the output values , for example , to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : using this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and shop : using these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be stored and later loaded again . the Gimp &apos;s level format is used .
when using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the procedure will be re @-@ adjusted automatically for all the shadows , means and solar cells . enable the paint pi@@ p@@ ette to set you and click on the preview of the Hist@@ o@@ Program for Rot@@ - , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Ex@@ cess Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels , i.e. , you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the entran@@ ces applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied channel : this selection box allows the channel to enter the channel modified by the module :
besides this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further .
for example , if you move a track to the right , i.e. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright sounds are dar@@ ken@@ ed with dar@@ ker cut@@ lets and the corresponding picture pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value . create a dot on this line and move it then , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you can have created can be loaded in fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp article format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of sha@@ d@@ - , medium and sun tones . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ load inde@@ er controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun tones were applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the color sha@@ vers of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer to imaging .
using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how you can fix the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison via his own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . when you position this in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the respective colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you want to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will also retain the appropriate colors . this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate colour components , as the channel @-@ mixer is to reduce your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes visible in the same place in the colour canal and their sound pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion into which you can reduce the far@@ ction first .
saving and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can save you later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the Ex@@ cess Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels , i.e. , you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photograph was always fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white was a step , since color pictures can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lin@@ k@@ filter . this looks great , at all the scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with orange arrow filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ ang@@ ter .
rot@@ Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ est@@ ial effects and can sim@@ ulate Moon@@ light to day @-@ time . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones as he added a little cold in the shadow oils . this is very similar to the process of drawing a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter &apos;s relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photos is not easy task . to keep the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ amed eye . under the frame , the module can be rest@@ art@@ ed from image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideally suited for black and white pictures ) , it is sealed with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a frame frame with patterns .
width : width of the frame is in percent . value range is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture is larger than the original , but the original thing is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply place the text and place it with your mouse . you &apos;ll need to adjust text , color from the color space and the character set . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame for the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the picture is stored once , the text part of the image is changed . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil you can use templates via a picture .
the image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for sten@@ cil there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . you must , however , take the P@@ NG file format and should be adding maximum compression size ( 9 ) to the size of the file size ; if you want to add templates , please send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ ous templates ; mailing list digi@@ ous @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you must set your template folder with the button base folder . select the folder where you copy the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a tree view is reflected in the template structure of the template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the Pre@@ view , three buttons are located with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the displayed picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you must shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move under the template &apos;s template . take the image and put it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply templates to your image . then the image is then adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; puts three different tools available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ceful images .
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look shar@@ per . actually it does not use a bit more psych@@ ometric . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without a focus as well as most digital images need to be summar@@ ized . elements are smaller than the resolution . elements are smaller than the resolution , so that sharp edges can be printed with only minimal edges . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras will normally need more int@@ oler@@ able than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used by internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw @-@ format , however , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanners are already turning a hot filter during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ er value . that can be correct with the menu entry .
however , you should use it carefully , as the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the edge of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the usable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture the tool re@@ focus . in general , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to correct the image a bit soft , is much easier than to shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool to use with the menu entry and experiment some with settings . the thumb@@ nail on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the front panel shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce often good results and should be tried first . if you make the sharp@@ ness , make noise and the impression of gr@@ aten in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ als . they should therefore def@@ use images on the best in their final resolution .
the amount provides the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely image that will be added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB @-@ value and the use difference . thus , there can be a minimal difference in order to be applied to a edge of the filters . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded , and therefore beauty mistakes in faces , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) and the processed picture was applied with a radius = 6.0 , the amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.@@ 0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ting filter @-@ filters from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to rever@@ t a picture to &amp; quot ; in which it is a better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Filter@@ ing . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a shar@@ per mask . they can usually start the use of a shar@@ per mask . you can start it from the menu by using colors re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular process works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung also has a very long tail , which is far from the source pix@@ ies , which is far influenced by the original pixel pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is influenced even very strongly from the remote pixels . it causes undes@@ irable results .
circuit sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results if your image is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to Hei@@ ligen@@ vou@@ chers .
correlation : an increase of correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you accept arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a high value is the image to further contam@@ inate the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ yed art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value zero , you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
mat@@ ri@@ mal font : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , it is possible to generate good results , especially if you select large numbers for a circular shar@@ per or the s@@ lap . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all access , color and intensity correc@@ tions before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ots produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to always produce un@@ sharp mask . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of def@@ use . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters there is always at least as good as the infin@@ ity mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better than the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image that has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the focus is due to in@@ sufficient light for car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ ehol@@ ding in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the controller gl@@ aze the shar@@ pen@@ se of the area has been dar@@ ken@@ ed , thereby causing a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour tin@@ ent allows a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove un@@ required arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are highlighted below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smo@@ other place above the image . weigh@@ ted more hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous regions for smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should be obtained from details that no sharp@@ ness is needed . please note that the details should always be ordered .
accuracy dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a high value of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG Arte@@ facts will be best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . set this value as suitable to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to produce the image geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular gradu@@ al integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is selected , there should also be small selected . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ness and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low . but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it to allow him out .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . correct adjustment of image errors can be her@@ eby stored in a text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ab@@ ort .
below you can see how pic@@ kl@@ es can be corrected using small art@@ e@@ facts . as you see , there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey was caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ p@@ ence ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool will be available to remove st@@ ains and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor cameras from digital cameras , you can read it in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ceful noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
below you find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at the default settings .
radius is controlled by the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large numbers increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can be adjusted to the image and the color in him can be adjusted and adjusted smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value sets the pixel pitch to be fixed . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not be obtained and smo@@ othing or dirt takes up again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response from the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or addic@@ ts can occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ ums if you want to remove a weak r@@ ushing or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings will not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings will not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ ble tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger than to increase . however , it also contam@@ inated the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ ding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges can occur when it is too high , the noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove r@@ amps and is the recommended method for this .
store under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the resulting output is applied with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . to sharp@@ ness the image a bit soft , is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen@@ ing the image with the menu entry and experiment with the deposit box on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo files .
this filter for resi@@ dual penetration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts , scrat@@ ches , compression per@@ missions and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ actively dig@@ itali@@ zed images , and thereby receive the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ turing is developed with another tool , the image error correction , which was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ i and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Arte@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Arte@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that correct in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can be rest@@ art@@ ed like a photo with a similar smo@@ ky smo@@ ker .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ iny on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures reduced to an old colour photo that was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which can be seen from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image below ( 1 ) can be seen and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos that were equipped with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by the copyright of Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality rough @-@ mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark picture to the correct image . note that the assistant is re@@ viewing the last dark picture and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the thumb@@ nail shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are empha@@ sized in all departments .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the neighboring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color picture , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous correction is a tool in order to correct the Vig@@ net@@ scape , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can not even light up the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ or@@ cover@@ t quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by using the light that can reach the sensor there .
but he also has draw@@ backs . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise faulty effects may occur through motion .
with the large @-@ layer areas of today &apos;s felt film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using an equivalent spectrum of a C@@ enter@@ filter . the tool is used without this filter . the algorithm is protected by a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three racks , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction filter , and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , or by chance to compens@@ ate an optical filter with an aper@@ ture of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ mask , to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , Con@@ tr@@ ast and gamma @-@ settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ scape correction . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regulator only need to adjust positive values as you just need to raise the settings .
if you want to adjust the coating of the target picture , allow the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma using zero and use gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the image in the corners and ( 2 ) the image @-@ stronger image and contra@@ ction correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ ous he@@ w ; lens dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric decay . color@@ ations can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ ric deteri@@ oration of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar aspect effect , but laughing at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical cr@@ ats almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected ton@@ ically @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion and positive values ver@@ sen@@ sed dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of dist@@ ortion fourth density . this value works more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &quot; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby re@@ jects a correct gra@@ dient of the first degree . negative values increase during positive the picture .
light : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . values you use for your image , are stored and used as default values for the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ or disc @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you perform an image and perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction for you find this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ n@@ and / ver@@ ver@@ ular dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
when you correct a ver@@ ver@@ ular dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Menu Transform@@ ers Cut out of the image processing or via zoom @-@ kno@@ b of this dialog .
for most images the ton@@ t@@ onal correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives as such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective so correct that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is re@@ achable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can also sim@@ ulate two parameters set for viewing and film Sens@@ iti@@ vity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ kno@@ b changes the amount of film gra@@ iny and domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter caps are mixed from infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film material used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image has been set under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the high@@ lighting .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film module is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ iny on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , which is to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer big silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ style effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get this special , Galerie @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this Filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner . the default value is , although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ style display applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ al filter ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to influence this effect . the upper select the brush @-@ size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for big pictures . smooth it controls the glass or , from the other side view the hing@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter used ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses paint and int@@ oler@@ ance gra@@ dients in order to define a stuffed cab@@ le@@ . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch for you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ b with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the size of the pin and adjust the contrast ( gl@@ aze ) .
this is an example of charcoal recording filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art through dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ ength 1 : share the image in cells and makes it look like it is viewed by glass blocks .
wavel@@ ength 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom : wi@@ pe off the image along stone @-@ shaped lines which comes from a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ har@@ p : bl@@ acks the image by rotating the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the diff@@ use of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ pe the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement : bl@@ acks the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
plast@@ ic@@ ating un@@ har@@ p : catch the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright colours . this is ideal to create romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or for adding a warm and subtle glow .
Schüt@@ t : bl@@ acks the image by random shift in pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent imp@@ ur@@ p : finds the paint pool in the picture and catch it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore use this calculation at any time using the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make re@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . thus , it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fis@@ her changes the optical effect of the drop on the image .
you can hold a range of shelves ; for example , use a range of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the range for example to check the area , e.g. a vision that should remain free . if you start the filter to remove Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the re@@ ent@@ rop@@ ed fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or rotating in the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the transform@@ ers turning on or transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you zoom out a picture and see the details ? how can you invent a picture of the resolution ? how can you invent the missing information , or guess it ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . choose the size change in menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge of an image . &amp; digi@@ ous algorithm uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are highlighted below :
maintain a aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the value of the original size is maintained in the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to produce the image geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and store are used exactly to this . every single image can be saved as text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of a photo infl@@ atable by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear Standard aug@@ mentation .
the cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated operation to create a picture . to cut a photo with the mouse , sque@@ eze the mouse button and draw the rec@@ t@@ angle , then create . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus , you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting off . you can draw the size of the corners when you draw on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . create a new rec@@ t@@ angle , simply drag it to the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ section , use the button The Cut button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save file Save or File Save as in the Menu file to save the newly added photo .
in the thumb@@ nail you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains .
in the Tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a high @-@ format or cross format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross format is assigned the width .
the tool Fol@@ lowers aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal to whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically unlock the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog you can set the max . ratio kno@@ b to the area for cutting on the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool allows to cut down aspect ratio ( Horizont@@ al or vertical ) . if you are using the default dimension , these settings will be displayed as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the image and not the original image .
the settings of merge help allow help to bl@@ end help , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ re@@ els , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden middle is a divi@@ ding that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell , or the stuffed leaves of a sun@@ flower . it shows in all sorts of things we find as beautiful .
the golden split is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with the old Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two progres@@ ses . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that is usually followed as visually harmonious .
the golden middle represents li@@ que@@ er relief lines when you put an image . these help are highlighted below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ as@@ par@@ agus , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the image along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be just because its eye can be done without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden Tri@@ triangles from the above discussed golden spiral . their barriers are the average points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equ@@ is@@ an@@ gled triangles . diagonal to this lines can be more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame you create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your picture focus on one of the cros@@ spo@@ ons and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach .
the Horizont@@ al options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the au@@ xili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the au@@ xili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle .
if you do a photo , it happens easy to keep the camera completely vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things rot@@ ated around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are stated in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences , you can reset the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right top .
to make your help the module requires a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse into the picture preview to position the two lines . after reading it above an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is the function transform@@ ers to use from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Automatic Cut . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing gl@@ ut the picture a bit after rotation . however , observe the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed to be a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas which are created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas which are created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you get in@@ joy@@ ous dirty holes on the corners . a possibility to report this is to cut the picture with transformation from the image processing .
the tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module about transform@@ ers .
sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press on pre@@ ferences , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown right from the thumb@@ nail .
to your help a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse into an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image .
after which you have performed the shot , the picture becomes a bit confused . for a single hole , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings produce twice as much des@@ ol@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after cutting , the picture has un@@ fair tri@@ angular holes in the corners . possibility to eliminate it , cut the picture with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore compiled by your system and , in some cases , by the way such libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
based on this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F below .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; displays only files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras may even choose to use the format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression behaviour on digital images . this way , redund@@ ant information will be reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , gl@@ itter@@ ing results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , so you can read more useful hints in English by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful tut@@ orials . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ ous formats . all cameras can see below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of crude shell formats supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in the avi@@ - or MPEG format . it is no film editing program and therefore has no film editing program and is therefore no film editing software . &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start playing the program for playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the white module .
many tools you need for photography are in &amp; digi@@ ous ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft signs , noise supp@@ ress , re@@ focus , re@@ focus , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that is applied to the current image before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this gradu@@ al bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area .
horizontal share with no dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected area .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and exposure . used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and place them on the part of the image , which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ tion from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page Properties Tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters while shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider puts an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can hold out and move it onto the left mouse button . move it off by clicking the left mouse button . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course putting up your images Ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets . the application can be used to edit colour palms and to select and use colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes , or browse the folder after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color to it . colour is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted into the cur@@ sor . color will be inserted , or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ write . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be copied together with the actions copy , cut out and paste .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in the computer science , especially in the computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program that includes graph@@ s and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; graph@@ ite ane@@ w and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to display more than these knots )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ program that pre@@ sets the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for illustration of graph@@ s are required . in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in an own window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool bar will only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; select the main window as shown in the lower screen image :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the character space . you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically .
use the mouse ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ ite .
if the file has just been changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; uploaded file from another program is displayed , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; may also realize your decision , so that later , you can change your choice later ; you can set up the menu settings c@@ graph@@ viewer ; see also .
if you open a graph@@ end@@ ure outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the instance will open , &amp; eg ; in file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the instance will open or want to display the graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the setup dialog .
when starting the program start , you can open all graph@@ s at your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph should be applied on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of each part of the graph .
side preview with one on several sides distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again offers the option to specify when a file was modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening is the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if a graph is open outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site &apos;s seat management gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine how to be asked at each start .
the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further options are opened :
here you can select under various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical depic@@ tions of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm re@@ produces the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons over@@ flow .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ loaded graph . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , the syn@@ onymous with statist@@ ically multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ even graph@@ s a spring@@ board model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ ist@@ ics and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm sub@@ ordin@@ ates the knots of circular in accordance with the Description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which can then be programmed by a shell . the command should give graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as a parameter , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a lay@@ outs , you can change the graph@@ ite ; -@@ algorithms special options , or change the graph@@ ite with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ite ( directed or odd ) and uses the standard algorithm for each type of ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for odd graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the position menu is in@@ active .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ ite ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following program :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can find further options in the Settings menu .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid @-@ grid , where you draw the symbol .
created a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards a dialog appears in which you want to choose whether the symbol is created from a template , or if you want to re@@ boot from a template .
adjust the last step back again . if you do not have a step further , this function is disabled .
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey scales . this can create colors that are not with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; agree .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the point , on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ ordin@@ ates of the current pixel , the size of the current character , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

select Transpar@@ ent Pixel or display Lin@@ e@@ als and adjust Unic@@ ode : or a chess board as Transpar@@ ency Display . you can also set the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Groß and the Color 1 : and Color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read and available tools to refresh new images and order them .
this module can be used to capture new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports by the s@@ ane project or another source like Video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
when you scan the images , open a dialog box , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also use the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the specified standard value of duc@@ ts to select your image accordingly . check the image that is displayed with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image files of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images of geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo will be loc@@ alised . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to make a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization . this file contains of course data that have been recorded at the same time , such as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , the automatic correlation is carried out in red . GPS trace data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera is expected to be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . this can be done with time zone .
the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance is a higher devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera quality . the devi@@ ation among them will be merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can put these boundaries here and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have to use a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog lies with a call for the next notice , you only have to use the button OK to put the data in the current picture .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and be found . select this in the relevant region and increase it again . the height must always be selected manually . the height must always be selected manually . the map can always be switched between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is using to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 , to enable the best possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the riders are allowed to select all the albums . you need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right hand , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text can appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely expl@@ aining . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image displayed . otherwise , the image will be shown directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything you will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information will be stored in the new images as well .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this also affects the file size . all other settings are explained by yourself .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can see whether error during production has occurred . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press Close to closing the module .

after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images from JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising since there is no compression of the colour information . this can be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module &apos;s digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base risk . you can also add audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled for the correct video format . in addition , you can select a background colour for the Di@@ asch@@ au . in addition , you can create a background color for your DVD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you must first select the images which should be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you want to re @-@ adjust the other settings , select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is default , and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds . the speed of the image is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth shift .
the background color can be stopped next . in doubt you should set them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension possible .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , so you can start the creation of the movie using the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the Di@@ asch@@ au if you are back .
if a note appears that co@@ ils or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets on the right down button .
the pressure assistant allows multiple images to be printed along a sheet paper . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp . this is useful for you to improve or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software created from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that will be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button you can look at the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize conversion process . the first option decides to adjust the camera settings for the white off . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to process your pictures frequently , or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG than memory format , the metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file , or stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are nearly identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if this is generated in an earlier attempt . however , this progress is not available . a preview of progress is not available as far as the conversion progress is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , starting numbers and tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ et . you can reduce the image larger image or enlarge . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size .
proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo format . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images . more pictures can be drawn to the list of the images and place there .
after which you started the module , the pictures window is displayed by you . you can add more images on the thumb@@ nail . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . for the last chosen picture , a preview on the right is shown .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and make it possible to add them to the list of images .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of images .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client . you have to add only the addresses and the subject to the subject . you have to get selected pictures from you as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions for the size of e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the images for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format in the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and file the original files in JPEG format , the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to sen@@ ing pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can view the status in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically . by selecting the button , you can lock this window .
after starting the module , advanced di@@ asch@@ au appears to have a window with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album .
Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation are using very elegant image trans@@ itions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; let &apos;s go .
the images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used the order of images in the album .
under delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should not know this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between you can select . randomly chooses any transition between images another effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar , you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au .
at the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the complete number of images in your presentation .
currently , the K@@ IP@@ I Module time &amp; date has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the user interface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE employees .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; by these brows@@ ers , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , are now available in every group , i.e. in people , places and in group keyword entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories , for which you have typ@@ ed your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each for itself is described .
if you press the mouse to the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your work area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you have their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button , which is located on the right outside on the tool bar . please note that you can have the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display yourself with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to see this , you must select the image file editor , as shown in the image , and select the image for the corresponding person . in the An@@ si@@ zing window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed and cut off .
if you are searching for the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for assess@@ ing the image properties . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again .
if you want to enter a string or descriptions of the images in the field or description , you can also enter a date according to that text , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a part of the full date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , not Anne Hel@@ ene is depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this guide :
go to the website of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and check the quick entry , the screen shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and you can start the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; with photo@@ album ; for the first time you start or select in menu Help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . subsequently , some example images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as a program @-@ associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this corp@@ us can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this LEICA will show you about the images in your database .
the time line can show you several different time units . each case shows a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time line can be inter@@ actively using the following ways : you can change the displayed entries look out of the database ( if you select a date on the preview pane ) and also display the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the time bar by pressing the mouse button , and drag the mouse over the linear time line , i.e. the time information , draw . if you select a area , you will only show pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time@@ frame .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; includes two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s book , built in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; integrated version which you can create about the menu HTML ... call .
before HTML @-@ pages you will have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and target . in the following , each area will be detailed .
first , enter the titles and description of a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ Photo@@ Album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created , which is to be seen on the site . check out information about the export files you &apos;ll find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . for example , you can see that all pictures from a party are obvious . for example , that all pictures from a party are obvious . please note that all pictures are exported from a party . currently , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain amount .
in this area , you can define how HTML @-@ pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why these are not been made specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . thus , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor , which have the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no images allow for example to have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you &apos;ve defined . so he can browse your images with low resolution , which can look at a lower transmission time , as well . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , you specify the different folders and URL to where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder , in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to all future images . here you can select either a folder or by K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this is really visible all for the viewer . if you have created for the basic sub@@ folder , a web browser after the pages are created , you should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser should start the wrong folder .
in the case that you have created HTML files not yet in final destination folder , you have to manually copy them manually . so the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final target of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders can be found .
the only setup options described are all three on basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will set you into the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can , of course , create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you want to add a HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you will need to take with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even made .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . they can import others into your database . these features are ex@@ cre@@ ted with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in that the images can be stored in the file , or whether in the file is stored in the file , that you can put all the pictures together into the file , and the file size is so independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file to either from the File Menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , the images of the URL , which you have indicated in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file , will be searched carefully . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting images will be described , which you can catch on the File Menu ... call .
the most important option for this di@@ alogs is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
by option Manu@@ ally into the .@@ k@@ im file you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the auto option Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the pictures are automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most pictures have already been compressed using JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress the export file , simply select the files .
the last option of this page is maxim@@ ally limit image size . if you would like to send your friends images , the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can tell the size that each picture should be up to 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import , select &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; exported database as described in .
the assistant to import account consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , after that , in which folder that import images should be copied .
it can be that you are person@@ ified to the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window , which are the categories of import@@ ing to imported file and which categories will match these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can see the categories of the categories from imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this will be shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : when you look at images , you want to watch images within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the various steps ( 1 ) for the information on your images , via ( 2 ) the search and see , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities go through .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was extended and now it takes care of your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book it is talking about pictures , but often they also closes videos .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can back with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy on a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you like to start a different database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ Album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry settings c@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s booking you will be explained in the different settings .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call recording possibilities and options for viewing . for each setting , a detailed help is available that you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can define different properties , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
on check out the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ al as in .
in view of the setup options that are available to you in the list of members , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . check out information on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the modules . they are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have an help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together among each other applications , it can be tested that modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; demo database can be tested first with the demo database , before you call it on your own pictures using the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell you , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so that some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album are very different ; not functioning . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications which can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , so it sim@@ ulates for some modules the order for albums , so that you can use the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the current album , which matches the current view@@ point , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here comes &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as follows :
when &amp; Photo@@ Album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all the people , then each entry into this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used to define the category you &apos;ve defined in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you would like to use the category people , so do if you have chosen to view people and give the module to this one .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album are not compatible ; you can remove them from the list of modules . run the setup dialog and select the modules that modules are loaded .
in the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window at the top of the tool bar . at the moment the tool bar will see you . currently , we will not see any information about your images . in the section we will show you no information about your pictures , but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see any picture with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if shown on all images Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were included .
all of these comments can be used for searching and brows@@ ing as you can read in the section . if you like , you can see these comments by using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as you can use them again , when you enter information about your images .
the following idea lies the shift of images within the list : if you are shown for example a family celebration or shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the used names are moved up to the top that can locate and assign persons faster .
if you prefer an alpha@@ be@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have chosen remarks for each image , you may need to edit all selected pictures and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the picture of the image right above .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and add the menu item more than once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that displays the USA as trans@@ duc@@ ts . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the feature catalogue it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also use an entry to an existing or new category . attention , this ass@@ umes you just sort your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically . see that .
you can move the individual elements of the dialog , by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move it out . you can also make your own window by selecting it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and the look of the window .
you can also make a frame complete . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and click here to see window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the listing images in your browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you do not have a filter . you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply scroll down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easily .
if you need a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the removing button or select in the menu Edit selection . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can also use pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you will need to record the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; in the picture you can view the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t watch these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files out of the folder and copy it again . if you like to avoid anno@@ yed the file , so don &apos;t support you to add a larger hard drive to save all pictures you want to save .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to remain a little more privacy , you filter the images that you want to open for others and click on the current view . alternatively , you can also block all images that you may see your little sister , and select the menu entry Everything but above .
this way , you have set the images in the case of the F@@ alles to be hidden . if you lock the laptop in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu item . if you want to get blocked , click on lock on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to configure this password , simply select password in the menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means that you can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . you can read or delete all images on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is only available for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view on private images .
the reason why you &apos;re all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this is how you can start a preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in . he shows the image , but additional all the information you have on the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box appears on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can also configure that information and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and skip down the buttons picture high and picture down . you can get to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run these as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; loads a new picture after a few seconds . as often a new image load can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus the button C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of viewing &amp; photo@@ album ; is it in full screen mode to change . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can use in the image and zoom out . to enter the image you can get a rec@@ t@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button , you can check out the Plus button p@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows like a zoom @-@ rec@@ t@@ angle marked and shows the result of Zo@@ oma .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed , so that every pixel sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations function in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus .
with the display functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . in the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to mark them . but you &apos;ll be able to highlight the picture and see more images .
a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer . to see which photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you can view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch images with features , while you can view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you press the respective letters . in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these will be available in your browser . so , if you have selected all images you can see , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in thumb@@ nail view . if you can display categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can press the characters for the feature by clicking the image after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture .
the painting is not stored in the image , but in the database . you can reverse the batch later .
you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch to the painting by &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; Please select the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully domin@@ ate but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and displayed the object in the wire window views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already chosen with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu will end , so you can choose the right position :
with del@@ e@@ tion from the menu bar on Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can pre @-@ remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified properties , click Apply to Apply this Chang@@ es . if you typ@@ ed invalid values , submit a message with error description and click Apply to Apply or reject the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you process a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the self @-@ gallery view .
press preview in the self @-@ gallery and a small example of the scene is rendered using the selected texture , even if you want to ren@@ ame a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the window .
each object has a visibility level . you can specify this value relatively to the level level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the tool selected in the tool bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order for default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them as desired . you can also save multiple window arrangements and easily switch between different direc@@ tives .
to anchor a window over or under one view , drag the Anf@@ asser to the upper or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle appears then the new position .
to create a new column , pull the Anf@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views of one another , drag the Anf@@ asser to another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map line up in the views .
the last possible window rules are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the Anf@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small pointing left arrow at the Anf@@ al bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al strip . to prevent the lock , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are obli@@ vi@@ dly , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window assignment ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to rendering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently available . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini @-@ files . he determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can select any number of root modes , from a fast preview up to full pictures in the highest quality .
when you click on the tool &quot; The R@@ ender &quot; in the tool bar or in the menu view , select the following dialog :
any rack mode has a name . you can enter any name at any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the card box size you can enter the width and height of the dispens@@ er image . if you want to render only one small area of the image , select the bottom section of the image and enter the image section to the rendering fields .
in the drop down quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the feature features can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is placed with just a ray of pixels , different mistakes can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or display effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general pictures look better with this feature .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard , adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel continues to be split up and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if you set the difference between the measured pixels with super @-@ sampling , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific number of pixels with super sampling , then a grid of 4x4 is charged at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the above threshold , then the pixels are checked individually and further tested on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , when the related rays have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command @-@ cat@@ cher of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if occurring in import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene . to import objects into the scene , simply drag the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click on the help in the self @-@ color view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . adjust the path to your doc@@ tor@@ tion and version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example height log data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file is stored in different ways of the library , the first file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle in the camera view and in the window type license plates .
you can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the R@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and swi@@ vel .
larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better nails for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed press for two directions .
if you cross the high @-@ detail design for advanced projec@@ tions , all the camera are using an advanced projection . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better rap@@ proch@@ ement for projec@@ tions , but requires more time to rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is thrown behind the objects . the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross ground , a floor below the objects will be rendered . the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the ch@@ urch@@ eting method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can create your window orders or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements , explains how you can create and save window arrangements .
the drop @-@ down window system : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of the window direc@@ tives shows all existing window orders . create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window beneath the existing window , with card card , you can &apos;t get a card box shared in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just now &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can set all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene : a ball on a level .
but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain about it as a result , you should only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , take a look at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect a proper idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this is the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of object properties , where the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera is in view of control points , with which you can change the camera in view of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place .
when you press the button or press the button , the wire model views and the slide show instantly change these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a sque@@ e@@ ader ( insert in the body ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it is actually a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view also indicates the plain , although at the moment only as a limited end@@ able level . if you render the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find out that you can click on the item + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object characteristics .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you will get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box will be shown in which you can select as the object is inserted . please select the item ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button below you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you can still type settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities but now take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click the user button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , that &apos;s not the color . you have to insert two new attributes . in the color list you have to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree of each time , select the colors in the object characteristics :
this step should you already be able to run , since you have the basic method of work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor :
in the object characteristics , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : in 1 ( do not forget to press the button or push the ball contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already in the ground , type a pig@@ ment as a color :
first select your object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click Sp@@ aces Sp@@ aces , then select Unic@@ ol@@ oured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take time to introduce some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection make up already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : even not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what capabilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) through each pixel , the visual effects of light sources are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects , such as fog , is processed .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye to see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be reli@@ eved , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . usually , P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you created before with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu , replacing the oldest entry in the list .
if you already stored the model , it will be saved under the same name . if there is a new file , you will need a name and a storage space .
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been dropped since last time .
this menu entry can only be chosen if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu entry is only then select if you have used editing .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the keys and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change using this option as default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
open a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove commands to the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to make rough surfaces , without having to mod@@ ulate on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then proceed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel base through applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set whether every picture should appear in an own window , or if all images are always to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first characters in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name appears , the file will be highlighted by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can adjust the working mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keys can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you want to watch the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end of the last opened folder . at the next start@@ up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background colour . in the window mode , it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , window is bigger than the picture is filled with the selected colour .
you can also plug &amp; n@@ ick@@ show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option for large images , the display window is increased to the full screen . this option is enabled by default .
specify whether the slideshow should begin with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated as long as it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part file system ( one window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and one @-@ part view of file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic scale is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photography based on the &amp; fix@@ ture ; photo processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view and edit your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; make it as easy as possible faul@@ ts or possible improvements . wherever you use this , menu includes a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed ; and you can simply follow the instructions to retri@@ eve your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; ask and hopefully ask questions of other users . in this mailing list English , you should therefore speak English , so you should be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to join the developers mailing list . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control about his work processes as possible . to set up on these settings , you have to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color , which is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ shift indicator is selected . it should display colors with what you should see , in contrast . under@@ cover should display a bright color and exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also display them in image processing , where you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and storage .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer make images and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before storing files .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by entering the required information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ ph@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in Terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog box will be opened to the scanner .
the user can select the use scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop @-@ breaking &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options are not covered .
to add a picture , the user can only start a preview can start and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in so that the full preview can fit in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if saving a preview of the settings is selected , the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below , then the image will be stored and lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will get back to the main window .
the button settings will open the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can pick up . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog in front of each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will then have to save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save after a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images can be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the automatically stored picture gets a numerical suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE to dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this abbrevi@@ ation . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts into the player window and select Global Keyboard Del@@ ight by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , click the button to select ... .
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short commands . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists brows@@ ers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look &amp; z@@ b ; like :
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed due to a missing dependence . please check in your script if all the modules required are available and use dialog , so the user does not run .
Beg@@ in : &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Hard Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; for this script V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the file scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . they will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with amar@@ ok and control amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable control of external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends not@@ if@@ ications to all running scripts . for that reason , scripts should monitor their default entry and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ ist the script to display the setup dialog . to store the setup and loading of the setup data each script must take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the file folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the pieces length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ rating between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ es@@ Tit@@ le : sub@@ menu display , reve@@ aling the path to the selected files of the playlist . in order to add a user @-@ defined menu entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ xim@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script Mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if the user stops , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example to do , for example storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which can be compressed using a web@@ server . basically , such packages are used in the basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended Imp@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages immediately .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can upload it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ not ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily move into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you can find only a very specific titles from thousands in your collection . you can find also a very specific titles from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok offers an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to re@@ live your music !
usually you have to enter the following folder in amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulty in comp@@ iling any difficulties . if you encounter any problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has as most applications some options which you can enable or disable the comp@@ iler with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain depen@@ dencies must be met for some of the comp@@ iler options , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ating Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty regarding the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window will display and display the Player window in addition to the playlist , if the option is switched off , only play@@ lists window is displayed .
use voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled , the option switches the experimental function of the voice command .
tuning full of design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . this means the used color scheme is altered for the mood @-@ bar@@ ometer .
loc@@ ating voice files from the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , .@@ If this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the memory location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
other brows@@ ers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
to save playlist , the current playlist will automatically save when using &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the memory location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files are stored .
updates can be seen in the play change that the play@@ lists window is up / off , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when you change the piece to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played .
the section features you can custom@@ ize &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can use the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select the font in the following field : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . press you select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself choose the Qu@@ al of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection for front and background color .
playing at the start shows that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the sub@@ window on screen display allows you to set up the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click on Select ... to select the font the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow that the text is sha@@ ded in the O@@ SD .
own colors use the possibility to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the colour palette opens the dialog for color selection . if proper colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ not ; colors are used .
the input field display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . through the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to the needs of your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ amas users . thus , you can define on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output audio output allows you to select a audio driver from the drop down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this map card .
the Map Collection will be used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that should go to music files ; to search for a folder in the collection , check the check box next to his name . this section also includes hints for adjusting , as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folder : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as whose sub@@ folder will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists Import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . then the added play@@ lists will then appear in play@@ lists .
the part collection box is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further setup is needed in the sub@@ window MySQL device .
the MySQL institution is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered , the MySQL database is entered , under which the database is entered , under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced .
use username : and password : enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m map card uses support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music @-@ recommendations regarding the current piece .
here , enter your User@@ name and Password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send out pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts ab@@ ort : after activation of this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to each of each play . note : you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you need no l@@ ur@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix @-@ systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen shots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window manager will work with the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org for example . Gn@@ ome will work for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can check the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ e.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang also the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and set the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib is crashing to read the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
make sure all compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries by the same comp@@ iler version . if Z. B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable auto . switch off when in@@ active for ... to the setting of the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically when a crash ) . if it is a commonly occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 to the Meta @-@ Infos , but it is not described as Unic@@ ode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; file does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ ror in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status of symbols in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status disabled on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , up to three times a symbol indicates that this attitude shows its effect .
if you get this error : icon look@@ up error : an un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixels , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that Amar@@ ok is the correct version first .
there are some ways . most inst@@ aller issues are clari@@ fied by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net at the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one bug if something is located on a bug of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how come there now music pieces ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate each piece , in the playlist , the evaluation bar must be displayed . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review on a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , exactly as you would do it with other files . as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras Equalizer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question is which media types supports G@@ aul / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so rather every single audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and P@@ NG de@@ code !
it can be ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which can be delivered in the default not MP3 @-@ decoder . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ se @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously through a sound card using the hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the cause of cause and cause a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be deco@@ ded first . if you are looking for a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you read a decoder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend right at AL@@ SA , exactly as x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts &amp; multimedia sound system . enable the sound server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause st@@ oked play . read this error report . read the sound of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .

after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all components . lead G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for the IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ file before ! ) : - Store you to comp@@ ile , comp@@ ile and install it . then go to G@@ ST @-@ register all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok .

replace IP address with your IP and user name with your user name . this suggests that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is available .

l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss @-@ free audio compression and compression . it is used from the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ é@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t wma files to burn them into an audio CD .
so@@ x : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a full @-@ featured car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect , which can be played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch a CD and automatically play all videos on the CD &apos;s basic sub@@ folder .
this is a convenient method to re@@ load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise , after a new file name is asked .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose File and File Name for the project file .
stores all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would like to store for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project changes and hasn &apos;t been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then withdraw between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the lock and keep the project open so .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will in@@ quire for each un@@ stored project what should happen , exactly as if you had called for each project file .
includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ stored project , what should be done so as if you had called File Sch@@ ed@@ ding .
if you start this entry , you can select over the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if the current project is a data CD , the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is causing additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medi@@ ums , the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the Properties dialog for the current Project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the customer ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files existing on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium they only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also download a picture of a CD instead of normal copying . you should also prefer c@@ ann@@ ons if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy to another medium . alternatively , you can also get a copy of a DVD with the help of copying a DVD . alternatively , it is also not supported , so that the target medium has to be large enough to allow the whole ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW which allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the type@@ writer and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a previously invented CD image . the dialog asks you to burn * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ on * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously invented DVD image . the dialog asks you after an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pushing the burning button .
a previously published DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but it also contains information about the read @-@ out video , coding settings and even options to modify the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the map view and include the characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
turn the folder view or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or dis@@ card the medium .
turn the content view or out . the map view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the map view is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , if a drive has been selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switch the fl@@ ange into the project view . the head bar is a narrow area , which only is visible when the project view contains open projects . the fl@@ ange has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after having chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust button assignment .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus you can set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password administrator to start the system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b will open ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work properly . this dialogue is intended to Person@@ alize and to adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ Applications . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function cat@@ cher , so it is rather your taste and the type of your assignment vital to which the accompanying program will give you a suit .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start a bit like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two more parts that are described below .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void dist@@ at@@ d@@ vd ( ) void dist@@ at@@ d@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) , and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference , it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void p@@ add@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void qu@@ anti@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string _ name ) void set@@ vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT and $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ p k@@ 3@@ b cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ urn / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / regular fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; is an audio CD ; it &apos;s a audio CD ; it can be read @-@ read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are also possible , depending on en@@ coder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ ers ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) may still be installed from the Linux distribution . additional co@@ ils can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , it must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders are already present , so it is highly likely to comp@@ ile something yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders may be installed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation will not be required .
which code / file format should be used ? the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about co@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying the protected audio CD ; as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ .@@ cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data . if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to read a protected audio CD ; even if not the mechanism of copy protection is possible . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be made ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending which codes are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ DB from the Internet , or can be fully covered without network , with everything manually .
this is just a quick list of commands of the main track . on the side step by step , you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab card configuration .
start CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the installation of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
starts out and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Ko@@ di@@ zation Settings tab - the encoding .
if a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available Encoder , so the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default value . it is too noted that the en@@ coder settings in the tab settings dialog was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file to code will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and add .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; ends ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ aster and compression rates , and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , lose the information by data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both co@@ di@@ ers produce excellent audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will be included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high quality sound quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ playing devices is available .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially , these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ le . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ le . well enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ mos@@ s . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that entered manually or from the Free@@ DB program via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be handed / needed to create the file names and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch to these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s must be encoded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ks ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter the information you can download , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the author of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ e ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; and besides , the information can be hurt on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither can neither the artist nor the music business . all information can be hurt anyway with a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; is active to select a check box ( sending a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ v ; used to use Free@@ DB will be used to use geograph@@ ically on the next level mirror . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only updates the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know it in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this is not done yet .
to store the read @-@ up WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first time , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab yourself .
the co@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ erer can be used before the co@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , you can get further information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) must be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check out the device &apos;s name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reader of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the design of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program precisely what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your PC . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case it is not necessary to comp@@ ile it as a completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd contains and that you have scre@@ ams on it ( eg ; by copying it with the con@@ quer@@ or something in ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ei@@ ves ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for every read &amp; CD ;
here we identify the co@@ di@@ erer for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) and which structure is used to use the Free@@ DB file to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the right settings are found .
the device number is delivered to the reading program so that it can read / write data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , it can also be used with the file / etc / f@@ l and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card map material settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as input / typ@@ ed as shown in screen picture .
only when im@@ partial information is available , so that you will be informed when information to create keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card box CD ; Settings . just select both entries . we are convenient and letting the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that he can access the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , begins immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is easily changed using the database entry and the file name change . the directory names or fil@@ en@@ ame will be easily changed using Con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter the selection fields and Free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is more than 620 MB , if you have to use the database before . however , the two sel@@ ections must be selected twice , at least the first one . mode is set up on the following card box .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put it all as shown in screen picture .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at it after a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , because many fire@@ walls are working 88@@ 80 by default , but there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be enabled .
just assume your screen &apos;s settings . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously las@@ hing pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try myself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored . if the box is not checked , the files will not be checked , if you want to make this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
all to enter as it is on screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances a bit to the right has to be seen .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo equipment . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ c@@ ting the production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . in case of later modifications of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files at the same time : using a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can add more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ v ; termin@@ ate . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; it is described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ DB will be picked up . the process of data is described in this section , must be repeated for any expansion &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD ; which is not yet included in Free@@ DB , the screen shots are slightly different from the data available for a &amp; CD ; so you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will learn to collect data manually instead of taking them out of the internet . comments will point out to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example s can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of this author &apos;s book .
if this is not yet done , so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window so as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified , and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then check the questions and answers within the help or go back to the previous section on basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by Free@@ DB , all songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually rede@@ em this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not get any local database , you will need the Internet access to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into a &apos; Update &apos; box , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ cs per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments playing together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from Free@@ DB is not empty , it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words are with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields for the comment , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have an unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; max . this option is set up on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ settings tab ; throw a look in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the co@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the output release . in this example , this is not important because we will not transfer the &amp; CD ; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears and you will see that the fields are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album will be displayed above the list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the title will be selected . just make sure that all pieces are selected , or refine your button to select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button select the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
click on the tab card to turn off on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left side of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer , which you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been encoded with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the list list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code in parallel . note the status item in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour , the number of parallel processes to read and code . at high @-@ level machines , the result is un@@ clear . the use of the computer with a am@@ d@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous failure and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will display with a message for a short time in the top left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the co@@ di@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ya ; today you can enter@@ tain a pre @-@ compiled package within the &amp; k@@ de ; if you &apos;re familiar with CVS , you can already install a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ v ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons created by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program will be adapted to your needs if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variants of settings . at best you read the step for example to learn the options and settings . it shows screen shots of different card maps and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu has been clicked on the initial starting point as it should go on from this somehow clear screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t hold this manual . it is intended as the first version for a guide to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ v ; may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange when we managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real @-@ key emphasis on texts , the other and UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; &amp; &amp; ; -@@ support . &amp; k@@ mid ; support also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asonic projector , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encing .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of any MIDI channel ( MIDI ) with emphasis added on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be drawn at Mid @-@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ Mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File Menu . it appears to select the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and put the kno@@ b button in the tool bar , select the entry button from the menu item or put the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the speed display . to get the original speed , double click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a print is on the space bar or selecting the menu entry break in menu piece , then breaks the playback . push the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is used automatically , so that you can do nothing manually . if so , in the menu settings , the Karaoke text is selected , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to adjust an event type , select the entries of tex@@ tures and song events . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you can summar@@ ize . these are played in a row . in this section , as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ising ... Click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the items in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a tune with the button . again , you can select the file dialog , using which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song is depends on the Automatic Add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece of open ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is added automatically to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not activated , it is enabled to open the temporary collection when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click Rem@@ ov@@ ing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played off . if you select The series after the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be reset .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list on the Karaoke text .
to jump up a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back to a song , select the button pre@@ defined piece , the entry predicted piece from the menu or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button to delete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in the events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM are compatible ( including AW@@ E - and G@@ US cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary changes for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . for this , however , that every occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) .
fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note , that the left side of the equilibri@@ um is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 &quot; s .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue . to do so , you can attach the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( tissue shooting ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of patch is meant to represent a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that sound the sound height of the same drum ( like him some keyboards do ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how notes are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to create notes on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to transfer some channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you are using the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must not be defined in front in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ us@@ sions patch on the per@@ uses channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied in which relation Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI @-@ file is disp@@ uted with the value , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that the map file doesn &apos;t stand dec@@ imal ( s ) .
this setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard that will play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards up to play two notes to a oct@@ ave is to play the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit by &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use an MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in menu on Settings , Point MIDI settings
the canal view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ oons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this piano , see which sounds just played .
you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument , no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the canal view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings menu : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file may lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone else to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; it has happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
previously , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can push the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this screen , if I want to play a Karaoke file or play a file , simply switch to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window , and move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this an MIDI file .
and then join the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or the postcard , this will be animated on me &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the third year I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much time to take for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , making music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , or even if you want to make an error , an error , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; please write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you would like to send me a postcard from your home location or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or MIDI @-@ file , I will receive you in contact with friends from &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to contact me , you should contact me as I already have the file .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if you &apos;re back .
it is possible to submit the preferred links under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you wish to create a list of entries , you should use the category Dur@@ able playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you copy an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ lists can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this by using a editor , but also by using the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , select from the menu , select either the playlist , or select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at Star@@ ts and Be@@ aches can be de@@ activated by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and modification of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . you will consider the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would end at the end animation , however , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / ed ; &amp; lt ; / Ex@@ ile ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MIL that of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data base from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example of how a flash @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played using the sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special box Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module needs to be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the settings dialog by K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles to start and after error messages regarding charging the browser module &apos;s library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
for example , a given back@@ end to be taken for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be scre@@ wed , the scanner can be configured using the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is detected in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected , from which one has to be selected . the correct name is probably contained a DVB it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , it should also work ( presumably this kind of playing video devices under Linux too ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server . therefore , it is necessary to include the X@@ Free@@ 86 server in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , the source used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources are used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ el , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , original source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play of the playlist .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from him ( not from VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after joining the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom at the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is starting only slowly , why must each time be checked my CPU on their performance ?
note : the answer is exagger@@ ated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , just the first time x@@ ine check the CPU .

here &apos;s just a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it &apos;s not the ultimate book to be done . for example , good control , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

similarly , as other lab@@ eling languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text can be defined with the command \ \ &apos; \ &apos; document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is an extensive function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some examples for creating the document . it can also be made on the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : this way the type of the document has been chosen : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; ro@@ r@@ book &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : it is used to use character encoding . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Documents ) .
this list contains the usually used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for connecting them to the box they are selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , document classes of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in creating German texts .
new users now have no wor@@ ries . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , there is a simple problem looking at that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is supported by the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you through the emphasis added time and fin@@ er .
when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; } { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates an empty line ( for example \ \ \ &apos; command } ) and the added line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command &apos; ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; set up using La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the best and sub@@ mis@@ ing element ) :
when you view the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective view .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; stra@@ ight@@ forward file size ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ im@@ File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; -@@ file contains a description of the format document and also other information as the font method of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and systems .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ r@@ ye search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file was clicked on an element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked , the respective passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer jump .
Master @-@ Document : this feature is used in working with multiple files . with a Master @-@ document simplified the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project , a project can be set to project project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is to be seen , and there is no appeal of &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after quick assembly .
when editing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection range should be put into the document . the first selection box is developed for rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The sti@@ ble and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is available for items such as tags , fu@@ zzy notes or references . these options are :
name : with this command , a description will be created for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection of a selection box ) .
using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for the editing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are necessary only if the file is necessary for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; -@@ Files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name of the field is used for the establishment of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the fox notes , etc . , there are the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; ile , two choices are available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and basis of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; class will contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font &apos;s font . if the font is not set at the beginning , the text can also be done in the text .
once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex file has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu or the button Quick structure .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; save the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , the log should be sought after errors . when using quick assembly &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; this is not the case , the log should also be considered .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text which is different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the written document should have been created . the command \ \ &apos; start { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; environment } can be encouraged to give the let@@ tering of the written form within the surroundings . &quot;
the given changes are app@@ alled only within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; environment } to \ \ &apos; environment } . there is no coating ( number ) for the given changes within a environment .
there are many options to welcome the reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , you can add certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ic pressure , sub@@ str@@ ing@@ ings , etc . , these commands are either end using the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; start { recommended } : this command is available for the ital@@ ic pressure , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be displayed using \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ as { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language is presented , follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
as soon as the wizard has been typ@@ ed a bit of text , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to the editor by editor @-@ view or C@@ trl E ( with an external viewer ) the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into one &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file , easy to try and have fun .
DVI ; is a built @-@ in file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ oses ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screen screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; -@@ file , the same steps are available as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , it can print the document ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file made of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can begin by adding other formats using the F@@ P@@ FE in the tool bar .
the previous search takes the direct jump from the editor to the added location within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - binary files . only Modern at Settings K@@ ile has to set up ... tools building .
to find out for the pre @-@ search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in one line of the source tree and should be clicked on prec@@ ept . the jump to the respective passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then carried out .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; available and c@@ ile ; available as text editor ( settings Oc@@ ular ... Editor )
if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewing may not be possible , an error may occur . if a bug is shown , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file generates the error source in the source code . in the editor , the Kn@@ Ã © FE Pre@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors will always appear in which the error message appears . to be clicked on the error in the log file and c@@ ile ; jump to the error line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window to select the document appears for the document . the default values are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written or used by reason or the assistant to create a new document . more information is included in the section .
level users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file has to be created or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template with a template of an existing document and selection from file template ... create .
when creating a new document , a template of new file will be replaced with a number of characters replaced by other data ( e.g. Name or character encoding ) . these variables can set up in settings c@@ ile ... Settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ AP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be used following : \ \ &apos; Document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ BE TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the result of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be made of any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . becomes a simple way to create a template , should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps described under the steps described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers and emphasis on many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for the reading tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done out .
to find out more about Kate ; and his friend &apos;s options should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter on the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference which can be called for the amount of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it includes a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; you can find it as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with attached C@@ trl key to spread the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way when clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \ &apos; s \ \
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated left mouse button , the chosen text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switch , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse and lifting the various types of source codes . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands of normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants make available jumping stamps . this is an own sort of book@@ marks within the text . the menu item is highlighted among the next or last spring@@ time brand . also this spring@@ board is highlighted so that it will automatically be used during the first input of a sign .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already excellent mer@@ chandise has been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; ideal commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text code :
here , a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides contain an empty line ) . this extended meaning is not meant to have a text with continuous lines ( such as in other text editor ) . this extended meaning , thus , and all other lines of the source text . the only le@@ aning thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the dismant@@ ling is separated by two empty lines .
now the word is under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , because this command also has a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a clean star ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
to the fine of a part of the document , this can be removed all over and by pressing the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with your own commands a faster conversion . under editing , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of the editing of a paragraph .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; playing . therefore , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders in Edit environment for an incredible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the place of the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the sleeping place of the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; setting } is located to the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of hidden environment commands , the resulting environment can quickly be lost . this command l@@ ends the most recently closed environment , so that the en@@ chil@@ ly ambient structure will not be dis@@ closed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ x Group are a few important commands that meet with do environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the sigh@@ ted cl@@ amp .
with this command we jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the p@@ itting clas@@ p .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the devi@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located , ends at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many wor@@ sen@@ ed groups , par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly be lost quickly . this command l@@ ends the last group , so that the ti@@ led structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple requirements for application are used in &amp; c@@ ile ; for example the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , the sign is used for two simple requirements . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two locking characters for the name &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic hot plates can be set up using settings c@@ ile up using Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) can also be used in order to be used in German or French . they are also available for many other languages .
when pressing on Shift ; prompt &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , if the current position is within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to a tables , close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ &apos; with an optional line demol@@ ition .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support default &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users advert@@ ise the columns in tables and thereby re@@ arrange them all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; seek &amp; k@@ ile ; after the following tab@@ ulator in the dar@@ ken@@ ed line . although this tab doesn &apos;t want to be added , for example , to the columns for the columns in the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source of source code has been installed , this was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly used for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes have been installed . all these modes can be set up for the automatic run of work . all these modes can be set up for different work modes .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; start { environment } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the patch is removed , the last letter is removed and available , thereby the list can be smaller . on the other hand , the list can be smaller by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , these descriptions will be found to choose from a command . alternatively , you can also learn jumps to these positions using do jumps .
under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; full settings to these lists can be made . there are many different wid@@ ths for these lists ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and commands of the general language used .
the command mode is not possible to specify a few letters with \ \ &apos; s . on the other hand , a large list with ambient conditions is used . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; ile ; a special mode for setting up the environments .
when calling the fully @-@ editing buttons , the menu option or the key Alt + Shift space bar , the command will start automatically and it appears \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and be finished by pressing the input key .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list@@ ment environment , it is even a first \ \ item command to be found .
under settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; full settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the desired list of understanding mode for &amp; tex ; - und lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ile ; under@@ line custom @-@ defined lists of remote controls , which can be replaced immediately by using settings c@@ cal . as an example of a waste list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L typ@@ ed and the word spread over the menu pane , or the key factor C@@ trl + Alt empty space , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
rough tub are not helpful for the automatic failure . however , it has been noted that many books in a document are written more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ fil@@ ment for all already written w@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can set up in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Men@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings . the swelling value can be fixed . here , the swelling value can be determined for the display of understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the graphics dialog creates the layout of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be expressed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for grants and re @-@ ordin@@ ances of pages . if the PDF edition is used , so you can view the pages with a couple &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ Tools re @-@ arranged and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to treat the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating views .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewing like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion can be used by the Alt ; 2 viewed , by Alt ; 4 viewed , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file converted into a PS @-@ file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command , it is usually called a viewer after comp@@ iling . if no integrated viewer should be used , each time will open a new window .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... See the following information for the project :

the version 3.2 by &amp; quant@@ a lus ; includes many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ lus ; all these tools use comp@@ ost as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ location . the combination gives quick , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; you think it is supposed to know , and how exagger@@ at@@ ingly it is . if we need it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal switch ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and ready !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be attached to the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders , and enter the folder &apos; folder &apos; in the field of other folder .
output files will be stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted once every time , if my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , know how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; now there is a magnificent graphical interface .
if the opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then you simply let the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a output in the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .

often working on a project several persons are working together in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ a ; supports the specif@@ ying of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to identify unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of members of the team members who he is . this happens by clicking the Team Member from the list and press S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears to be bold as you are : lyrics .
sur@@ names and att@@ itudes of your own identity are important for messages and notes . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of the team members , there is another advantage by the members of the team : it can be created an event for information about the team manager when something is done . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something is done in the project . an example would be the sign of the opening and closing of the project , so much someone would have worked , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the side configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the addressing can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such ladder .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter the comments is simple . either the note entry is selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by note text .
comments can be sent to a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case , the nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager Sub@@ project Manager After the en@@ rich@@ ment and sub@@ project leaders should be led to the respective range or sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
nickname and rolls names are independent of big or smaller , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note void .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages that supports D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ isch and web @-@ based formation and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are re@@ achable via Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quantitative lus ; -@@ specific settings can be found , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up with Settings Quant@@ a ... to be called . Th@@ er@@ dialog covers some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative lus ; concerning tags including car processing can be changed . entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically added tags . normal Groß / Minor case means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / small amount of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / small registration means , the attributes are added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional Tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags .
start and end tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the appropriate encoding during boarding .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . by using the default , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly generated or in other ways than with the file open @-@ opened files ( where the encoding of the file may be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting is exp@@ elled from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is exp@@ elled from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ a lus ; created regularly backup copies , so with a power out@@ age or crash when the next start@@ up of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for not stored documents , a backup will be created regularly , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or an own view ( or the documentation in a map ) which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
put the window settings on the standard back to the next start@@ up is useful if the user interface comes through changing the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views over each other . it meets the --@@ res@@ p layout command line parameters .
the warning message is to control the option of warnings by pressing warnings by no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ izing the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; field , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse kno@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of structuring settings , the visibility of the tree can be opened in the tree , the actu@@ alisation of the tree in the tree , and how deeply the empty spaces are set to be adjusted automatically , while empty groups are found in which no element is found in the current document .
the area for fixed abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be developed in the editing of extensive text , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means , there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause indicates something different than in a group of valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are the third page , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following should be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not located at a stand@@ ar@@ there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be handed over to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; components within the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ read @-@ cap would normally refuse to load if this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the Plugin : is this activated , then checks &amp; quantitative information ; if the entered information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for qu@@ int@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error @-@ search was completely new . the support for the not necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in was implemented , which enables different implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ anti@@ lus ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in to the project settings . with the options options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; user interface :
a view where the content of the monitored variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ cy demands . this action is opened by default , which is normally a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be considered .
the counter@@ part at Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds of requirements .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ad ; to adapt to your needs and how you can find &amp; qu@@ ad ; help you get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages ; their simplicity and flexibility are made of &amp; quant@@ a ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up language and family 2 , the script language or &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files are comprised of two parts , the tag folder and the tool . tag folders ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document , as a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on transformation .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ di@@ alog@@ es , which shows &amp; quant@@ a ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; the tool contains a quick paste in a document without risk of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the read @-@ language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , and declared it is necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries are displayed in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class type . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method is . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has been a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally it contains the name and the type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that shall be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for the attributes in tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ a , is used to achieve the source data .
source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ a , is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method@@ ology name . the arguments given to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ ame % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once . it is a only element type element .
specify the position of attribute text in a dialog box . this tag can only occur in one dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the Tags . this element is an only @-@ element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end one day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to start with a &amp; XML ; - Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be locked and closed properly .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog in the top &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is not currently available . currently , check is only performed when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ a .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , a functioning family 2 Tag@@ x@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP is described ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &apos; 1.0 = &apos; UTF @-@ 8 &apos; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &apos; revision type = &apos; void &quot; re@@ turn@@ type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via D@@ TD . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ad ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
an action can set actions with settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button assigned to this action . with clicking the user defined can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings , and in execution of the action this text will be inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it &apos;s not limited ) to change the document or as input ( or parts of document ) , i.e. examples taken from &amp; quant@@ a ; even are the quick start @-@ dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EP@@ s .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . In this way , it is recommended to find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ ATH ( there are other special variable , which can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file it is removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : when used by the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; only one instance runs ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; at default input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the document &apos;s selected area is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the introduced application can be revers@@ ed . there are two types of output : normal edition , on the standard output ; error messages can be specified on the standard output . it can be specified by the default output that is set to be adjusted :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and if the day has attributes and you are planning to use , enable the tag &quot; tag &quot; if available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select the size of others .
please note , that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will mostly be interpreted as a symbol ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ alized , click on this symbol a &amp; lt ; starting the day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; ) and selection of desired promotion . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it is , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; functions for tool bar , or it should be shared to the better overview of some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
I &apos;d like to select the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the tool bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the tool to tool bar .
for example , I would like to preview an easy way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add to tool bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by adding all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the proper folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar is loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ att@@ ing language , which is like I like a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check the &amp; qu@@ ad ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory check if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , let &apos;s let you handle the second part we treat it here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = pf@@ ad , relatively to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top item = Section 1.@@ html Section 2 = 2.@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = 2.@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = GMT 2.@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 2 html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation area . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element , # Getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html getting started , # Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # prior to getting started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
you can notice that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ts will be replaced .
the section section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used to display the context of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ script file would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc / quantum / apps for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these well and it &apos;s worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. the documentation used to be used by the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; - community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked at the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the remaining resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places , we send an email menu , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scrip@@ ted tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; quantum lus ; users can be downloaded and used only if our team needs them to sign a useful contribution , where@@ with it requires a GP@@ G / PGP key . thus , the source of resources will ensure our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading you will be asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can enter one out . in the dialog New Resource ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading will be started .
the up@@ loading can also upload from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool bar , and files in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems warns and it can be canc@@ eled . if integrity has been given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specif@@ ying of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet created by &amp; quant@@ a ; it is possible to work by using a D@@ TE@@ P package because hundreds of tag files may be needed in everyday XML format . there are the easier way to automatically convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD , and Conver@@ ting a D@@ TD . choose the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itive line : the string that should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , produces &amp; qu@@ ad ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these concepts and make full benefit from &amp; quant@@ a ; this chapter tries to bring them to these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative . little benefits .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a range of components in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; .
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ a lus ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars about actions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ a ; saved . this enables the group to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; - patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project .
the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the buil@@ ders , the cart@@ ridges with info and the tool products . please strike in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click on the box with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current Doc@@ um@@ et matching entries , such as close the current , other or all map devices , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
legal click in the editor section lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse hand .
on the upper end of the editor , the tool bar of the editor is located . currently , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a proposition of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of products , the tool bars are adapted to the new features and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; if they want to insert the tag , then click on the tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog of different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and to pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ ridges are available for files , project , pattern templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation constructions .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ a . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using the right click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or delete the files from storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : images , program parts , all web pages &amp; etc ; It is open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in global , local and project also works here . by clicking the right mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit , or send by email .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of an element it is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element it opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buil@@ ders . with it man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . this enables the change of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ad ; from the quantum lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quant@@ a ; two cart@@ ridges at the bottom of the window , where useful information can be reached : the news window and the problem window .
this map shows information about each in quantum running script . for example , the currently used D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this map shows all mistakes in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ a ; scripts that are carried out , give all error messages ( so it gives ) to this window .
&amp; quant@@ a lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; to define .
a further function of &amp; quantitative lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with mail . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; if they get a tool bar in an email , they can buy them in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ad ; for this , auto@@ conf gives you a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here not executed .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ ATH is in front of their bin &apos;s folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a web development tool designed for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; quant@@ a lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up language editor . well , this would make him the most treas@@ ured web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; therefore it should be a suitable &amp; IDE ; for that it should be suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ not ; thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ a lus ; as they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ a lus ; enables Web developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost any task . through the program Com@@ mis@@ ystems , they can capture &amp; qu@@ anti@@ fy . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a quick web development and quickly developed to an integrated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details pane is provided with help : / qu@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or c@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; qu@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ reaching list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not located on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project asset management , only a bug is reported .
conver@@ ts special characters in inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board there , so that they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to add &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
switches the block selection to or from . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; key button .
go directly to an line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and switching the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; main window . the problem rep@@ orters will be activated when switching to the structural tree .
shows the symbols turn left from the main window . this column allows you to set bookmark with a mouse click .
if book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries predicted or nearest , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and add them to the project .
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available shipping methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further on / output modules ( K@@ io slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; quant@@ a lus ; the project manages . chapter &amp; quant@@ a lus ; projects can be explained in detail .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
add a dialog to add a new tool bar . it created only the name . actions must be stored by settings . actions must be stored by means of tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to store the tool bars .
removes a tool bar from the visual field . this does not delete from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ad ; - Team , so that the tool bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail with the tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
charging a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or any someone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; own description format .
charging / refresh of entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be rev@@ oked , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global , and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the shop fails .
this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ tions .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that , when this day is ref@@ unded by tool bar , this place contra@@ di@@ ct the rules on this place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu list . click on it . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disabled &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line recognition . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD , using the external application Ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , representing the display in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; 3.2 and used earlier .
additionally , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selecting a contract the corresponding sub@@ window will be enabled .
switches the status bar at the lower edge of the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influences any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
addressing the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete or delete records from the tool@@ bars or the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the maus@@ oleum environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can still use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ a ; development in financial form , you will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above , e.g. after filling the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the qu@@ anti@@ lus ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access , save local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Fil@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you have to download and modify . for server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one has to proceed differently .
use of an employee when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is based on new , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of your own .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by using the hook , remove from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can instantly upload files in the menu pane in the sub@@ window or using the key Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings are described in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option on top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view which will be loaded when opening the project . more information can be found in more than project views .
this means the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be set with the options . in the error search is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by adding a specific tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration you can add event actions , change or delete these actions . events will be executed if a previously specified event occurs , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see in details .
by default , Qu@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior can not currently affect .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ a lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project survey provides free access to the files in the project . there , files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave equally , but the entries are opening and open ... in the context of the right mouse button :
different profiles can be selected here . profile contains information on the site of the highly recommended files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removing removal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more uns@@ afe password on the plate doesn &apos;t get in question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ a lus , many high@@ land profiles can be created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing , or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t need to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your att@@ acker wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone can easily see in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple diving of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the newly opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu or the Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; to their own work@@ ings .
as already mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; at the best above the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding differ . adding tool@@ bars will be treated below in the section adding tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the tool bar can be created , tool bar or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where the actions may be displayed on this or other tool bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries to remove and action are shown that are self explan@@ atory .
the tool bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars and set up actions in the menu . set actions .
templates are mainly available in the key documentation , code Schnitz@@ el and files for connecting . &amp; quant@@ a ; you can copy , move or any existing directory in the pre@@ lag@@ enb@@ aum . templates have been in &amp; quant@@ a . in about the restrictions you submit to the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quantitative templates ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set before using any template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in pre @-@ storage space under global templates . further information about templates baum is available .
documents can be created by any text document type . on basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in an appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples may be found in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this type of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are listed in the pre@@ lag@@ enb@@ aum below global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates are serving all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder set , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus .
create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As a template . save your local template ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look under project templates .
select text in your document and click the file as a template , save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and inser@@ tion on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file will only copy in a template folder . you can use all file management functions , such as pulling and drop or inser@@ tion about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a file in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder , and secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
projec@@ tors enable a very target @-@ oriented advance . you can insert header lines and foot@@ er . you can insert files or link them with them . in addition , some things can be kept deep in the eye when using templates .
the basic structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files used in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates / apps / quant@@ a / template / apps / quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this option is blind@@ ed when the attributes shown are ver@@ ed .
this is enabled by default for everything except for a regular folder . if a regular folder would be set , it would be explicitly activated in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text size . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a trunk folders .
allows a previous or found text for templates in this folder . this could be general head @-@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p copy of content templates into a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folder or copy and paste from templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ a lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ site and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and edit the source code editor when needed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code .
in working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document called &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the v@@ oh@@ and@@ als of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not necessary to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , this mode is already active , if the key ten@@ ant is kept from one window to another , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Quant@@ a .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View may be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ anne for slow computer .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , the documentation of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor that is used to change the suspension Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ens . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags leaves the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. slo@@ gan@@ s for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added down by pushing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows changing the contents , such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to create or delete CSS rules in the browser . you can add CSS rules using buttons below the list or delete a change over the list . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a text processing , possible due to due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted into the type and can be deleted by button or remo@@ del@@ ing .
in the same way , inser@@ ting tags will be carried out in the same way via the tool@@ bar editor , as in the source text editor , if an anchor tag is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted into the text , each other input tag needs to be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables @-@ assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contri@@ butors had changed many changes , and at the same time had corrected a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging .
the program used by me was showing me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly was changed within this lines . and there was no clu@@ es to the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed . merge changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of additional useful functions were added .
if you want to compare quick text , just copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently from each other to a piece of body and make changes . in this editor you can even edit the results . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . this screen shows three source files with merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and mer@@ ging mer@@ ging folders . this screen picture shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences between the options of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check co @-@ check , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore when somebody changes the recovery . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by using only the file name in the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 folder Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 2 folder
the Open dialog allows to manually update the file type ( file ... ) or selecting a last open file from the drop @-@ up file . you do not need to specify a third file in the next time ; if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
via the button file ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , select the same or mer@@ ging of folders . if you select a file , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field will process for the goal , and it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file immediately . you can take this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also use pulling and shut down : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you would like to find out how similar these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , load it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now you can copy , paste and then compare these functions .
note : currently you can draw nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drag by text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part each text box is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path is too long ) . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line . then a small au@@ xili@@ ary window will show the full name . )
the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees the color , which file is different . if both files distinguish , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
links to the text is the gathering column . if differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . with some programming languages , the color will not be so important to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison plugs ) also has an information line with the wording : , the file name and &#91; it changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference must also be solved at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group &apos;s first line will be shown in all windows , and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this group will then be highlighted in the beginning of the group . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , through automatic merge or by manual editing no further line remains in the group ; then this is only a wild@@ card for the case that you can change your mind and perhaps then select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and merge differently .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy this text from the outcome window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources you choose to ignore or ignore C / C + + comment , changes in numbers or comments will be treated like white characters .
navigate up mainly with the picture @-@ up and the mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys to the left , right , down , side down , side down , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs , just click here to navigate directly to the navigation bar .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between plug and transfer mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already mentioned in the section merge and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or the next / previous conflict too . therefore , it must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ insert ) . if this option is activated automatically , you will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . be careful with this option , but you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line @-@ end switches are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in feed \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a line @-@ in mechanism \ \ r \ . diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ end of the source file , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not using binary files .
the options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when the next start . ( set up menu &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a writing with solid width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic font . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ring@@ ed . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically displays an un@@ regulated color .
when this option is activated , the tab button is inserted , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the inser@@ tion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , every selection will be copied automatically into clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board .
you can select which tick @-@ type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system .
when trying to find files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all identical lines in the source file . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . the second step is not ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a venture kick @-@ in &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; and a line slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , other again save only one line of line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is activated , wag@@ ering marks are visible , but as a white character must be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled . in default , this is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences will be displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is activated in default , but it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in automatic @-@ step mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going to jump .
solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you want to use it only from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + 2 comments .
these options are handled in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart the change . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is posted globally over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries are used for top setting .
in the selection fields for encoding a short notice , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this is how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used .
if you define preliminary commands , they may not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unic@@ ode , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output commands .
switch this off to sub@@ press review of changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + 2 comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal even a second excess column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply send the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window with each other or super@@ imposed each other . this option can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide then to merge the files together . a simple click starts to compare the merge file and use the file name as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ ting parts or to correct the adjustment .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when command line command . the output of the command is only used when typ@@ ing your own processor . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user to allow more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires that , and most users would not want to program the good news . however , the good news is that in most cases are sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .

CVS and other version control systems are used to include a number of key words automatically created by using the same pattern : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for an additional processing warrant for line ab@@ duc@@ ed . / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi it is deleted .
sometimes you may need to perform multiple consider@@ ations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the results from each other . example :
instead , you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and tracking . other operations only change the data that can see the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and combine complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without them really perform ,
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not to merge together . to merge together , select the corresponding menu entry , or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow )
while reading the folder , you inform@@ s a small message frame about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning the folder is completed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the button or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions to open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the plug @-@ in action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge starts , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if your overall content is identical . then the folder also has the same color . for folder the age is irrelevant to its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types exist . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types exist . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to synchron@@ ize , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assemble and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after merge and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then check the error message . if the files are different , then an error message appears . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ der can &apos;t be removed , the merge cannot be started .
during the merge , a file will work after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig on when the mer@@ ging was successful , and in accordance with other messages , if something unexpected is complete , you should make a final check and check whether the status is all right .
when selecting the file method Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the just selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all entries ( also in all sub@@ missions ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as target using the two @-@ folder merge and synchron@@ ize B and / or B as a target .
if you select a target folder , please check if any entries must be displayed in the folder file , too . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select File Com@@ mit / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the button closure ) . to complete only the current entry , select the action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting data types exist still invalid merge actions , a message appears on the defective items . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options added , stim@@ ulate and break .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then carry out certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is needed ( assembled a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see screen photo ) .
when you are finished with a file , select File Encryp@@ tion again , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you attempt to skip the cause of the problem or skip the problem@@ atic entry , or solve the problem in any other way , before you continue with the merge .
if some entries were assembled individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results in later , they will not be logged in . even if the merge changes , these entries are regarded as accomplished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ esystem , files have an attribute . in other fil@@ esystem , a prec@@ ursor is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
in case of links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links are treated as normal folder . if the option is switched ON , you will check the links such as normal folder . a link to a folder that will lead to itself and switch on a link . ) This option is switched off at default .
results in full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they are applied to files containing no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders about a slow network , it may be faster , only to compare the change date and the file size . please use a certain degree of safety . please use caution . this option is default in default .
similar to trust date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equally big . for example , if copying the change date is lost , please use caution . this option is default in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals will be selected to merge so that both folders are stored in both folders . this option is checked in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ing the newer file as an action , the knowledge is provided that the other file is not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is checked in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or delete a folder , then the original version is renamed . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option also affects the complete folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge list remains visible to mer@@ ging individual files ; if you don &apos;t want , you can turn the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , turn the main window in the window menu and switch it through between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . yet , in the directory menu , you can also launch a single file . as soon as you store the folder , the status will be reset to Er@@ le@@ f and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : re @-@ read the directory :
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ io @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be aware of :
a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. , which is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special signs must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
&quot; &quot; &quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no way to process per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date from the original . ( note the default of the size of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ oti@@ v . K@@ Dev@@ is always starts to launch the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part 1 , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it doesn &apos;t work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 is already available with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s Com@@ pare ) already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can result as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to see in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or go it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines , next to each other , this is co@@ is co@@ mis@@ attribute this is completely the case .
the editor refers to any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file , and it is too much effort to create extra file format , which could save this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly missing ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ked ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / or diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir exists the folder in your system , which is installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any problems occurring in comp@@ iling , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replace the current marking .
just display differences : files that are identical in all files do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re@@ view the folder when updating this folder . )
there will only be entries to exhibit the differences . in case the target folder will not already be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is checked in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already available ) , clicking the button will be removed accordingly .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ tak@@ ings in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the work@@ space to stop them or move it . this works both inside a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running applications . applications can be selected and even be moved to desktop and other applications .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on what the right mouse button is clicked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; clicked on , the context menu will only set up the two entries P@@ ager . if it is clicked on a application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if it is clicked on a application inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click on the command and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , At desktop and end . these commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of your desktop . appears only when it is clicked on a application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only when it is clicked on a application .
if this box is checked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces is displayed .
crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work@@ space . it is displayed along with name , the names with ordin@@ ates are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol indicates a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here you can define the order of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; like from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the side .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their content and move . besides , it runs outside the control panel .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and select selecting the switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t need to register root files or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key to wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :

&amp; Sounds ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start a window , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following this window is displayed as enlar@@ ging window . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fier window , an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting is magni@@ f@@ able ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mobile phone . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( selection mode ) or the surrounding of the mouse display at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
you would like to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed . please note , it &apos;s not able to recognize the mouse button . this is always the standard k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with arrow keys .
if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift ; push button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ drop is stuck , and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; Sounds ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to put into a file into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts and stops the updating of the display . stopping the update will cause the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , ger@@ ing , means , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window .
&amp; Sounds ; used automatically your set @-@ in commands to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ ads ( with the button Document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and cro@@ pping &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen bar . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen to consider the small printed in a newspaper or a picture . this application is for various people of use : from research or artist to the web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse po@@ uring a while on the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive @-@ road @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of the mouse click p@@ ains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse po@@ uring a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain of In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and those of the mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this , however , requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain when clicking the mouse , causing so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also have pain associated with the use because of your computer , if you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clear it once : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid having caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the reference because of the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonomic au@@ xili@@ ary agents , the result can fall for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the smart move is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move it up to the end of movement , before the release of the mouse button carry out . in this way , you can make the pulling at an impressive mouse button . in this way , you can pull the pulling out a bit exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this variation must be st@@ utter@@ ed after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es Differ@@ ence on , the Chang@@ ing Time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting before the mouse button is waiting , before the mouse button is resumed , if there is no use of mouse after the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking by clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move to the left and back takes a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears , you can drag &amp; k@@ de ; to make the response time to sh@@ orten . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the rider General . there &apos;s a shift sound buffer , you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start@@ up of &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window conditions , please find out the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values used when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button Application , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart shifts should be turned off first . if you then have used to the automatic mouse click here , you can later increase the smart shifts .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it might need to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at locations in the browser window , which does not display any link , will not park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is j@@ erk@@ y , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quick to see if you watch the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a shifts in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and post@@ p@@ one window .
the solution for this problem is that you can use yourself a mouse click . this is reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to make it . but you can &apos;t park the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop , if you are unable to cause a button of mouse cli@@ cks . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool bars and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shifts , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the smart shifts is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time to check it out in the clip@@ board . it is probably possible to execute it in the clip@@ board , and to do any other action in which you would probably have problems with pressed brick . here are some advice to do so . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent shifts , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use . instead , check the button next to the text area and hold the Shift key instead , while you move the mouse into the other end of the text and push the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this makes every time you play a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly when when smart shifts take the move . later , you can use the smart shifts also without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must have the X@@ Test Extension for &amp; X windows ; it should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers , and this correctly set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is short dist@@ orted . this program was designed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to whom the most people have p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling @-@ up before the mouse is let go . in this way also the pulling and laying with the mouse can be done .

if the check box is not selected , the text will be distributed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command will depend on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this can be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
if you want to use c@@ tom@@ y as a voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a standardized interface for voice @-@ over@@ s . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
after selecting a text passage , you decide which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ list or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of so@@ lic@@ ations , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and in addition to the outlet store , the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the second selection panel , you can specify whether the text password register can be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text password register , the book will be saved . if you select any changes , the text password register will not be saved . select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the password register should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ head page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ head . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down appears if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop down , you can select the dictionary to use the dictionary .
with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the name and select the language for the dictionary .

with this option you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries must be summar@@ ized , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically added words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main zone of the window to process text pass@@ ers is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ books as a tree structure are shown .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ code . if you select a text password register , you can only change its name .
to add actions such as new passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ers or text passages can be changed by pulling with the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .

K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which you not@@ ified of you are not@@ ified of you . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various kinds of messages ; for example , you can submit a message when your nickname occurs in a IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu entry not@@ if@@ ications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify are different depending on application .
filter for drawing replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ops ; incorrect or incorrect to correct messages ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is delivered to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages that can be accepted , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted as required . read about it as well .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering , text will be processed before he is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation to select wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language skills and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen re@@ users has the highest priority . it will prec@@ eded all other orders and holds up these orders . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resumed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
News have the next busy priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website . while you are welcome to enter a long text , who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ if@@ ications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text entries . every order that you encounter orders from the card card is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that might have text entries . text entries are thought to receive longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are executed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ users . if an application sends the issue of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such is read , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Saver . they are applied to regular warnings , messages , and text messages , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters are editing the text and keep it on the next filter . at present , there are three types of filters .
filters are available as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts can be delivered either as words or regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will enable you to create chat emot@@ icons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ form@@ at@@ isation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speech selection filter , you may send orders depending on the content of the text or depends on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter does not apply that its rules will not apply , he will keep the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ ification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters , which are set up on the page below . the processing is carried out in the order in the list from above .
this displays the list of mounted normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be handled from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will be shown below the following set di@@ alogs .
please enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . if these samples are found in text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement . large and lower case is not considered by comparison .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name but it must only differ from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column . replaced it with string from the column . the list is handled in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to shift the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions out of a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from the file that is attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . please click the button to press a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl + button .
if a value is registered , the filter will only be applied if the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail
you can get the application ID @-@ running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to enter just copy .
the strings filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ verse filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words , regular expres@@ sions regul@@ ates regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is an W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ulations . but it can only be applied on ben@@ ign XML . this program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ ATH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
you can send lyrics to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card card , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can specify that texts by K@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; gives a text to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected using the Text Spe@@ aker , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker card speaker . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is registered , the filter will be applied , if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can get it with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , you specify the properties of the desired speakers . if the text is fulfilled in the above filter conditions , the speaker is chosen to display the desired requirements at the end . click the button to display the dialog button .
use these buttons to store or load your speech settings , or delete all the settings .
the audio selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ verse filter if you need to apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers to give its applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the language support for K@@ TT@@ SD , so that c@@ abling ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the language @-@ output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ not ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language delivery services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Speech .
this is text of text to read , and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; console windows . start rever@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language support supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have established the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; but when using the module for Festival , websites are not read .
due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ Phone , so that S@@ able does not work at all . even if you don &apos;t have to use this voice to read on web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ ATH .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , giving all sentences ski@@ pped or only che@@ w@@ avy . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option of character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string replacement filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be started at the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages too . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language support . if you want &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use with another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , you will contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you purchase the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; available from the source file repository for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or download the tar@@ ball in every night , re@@ comp@@ ile and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language skills . to do so , you can use the script script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the set of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dismant@@ led into single sentences . the user can go back , repeat the output or cancel the output .
if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have set up the preferred microphone for the issue . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will find a spokes@@ man for you .
if you click on the card box ( click ) to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card box will be displayed . as an example , the card box will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to the modules .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included at the Festival in P@@ ATH , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting will automatically be made . generally speaking , western languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 can be used .
with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some kno@@ b and displayed this gray , the settings will not be selected by you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you load this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first rate will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker yet ( or forgot to click user ) .
if this box is checked , at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , the program window is visible only in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the section section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system section as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read or manage it otherwise .
here are all assign@@ ments listed in the queu@@ e , together with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card card .
with buttons in this series you can set a full purpose in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , any changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text entries are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ aul or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also
place the speaking speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately double normal speed speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program so@@ x must be installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out what device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map card , you can set up special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of speech orders :
the output of screen re@@ users has the highest priority . it will prec@@ eded all other orders and holds up these orders . after the edition of the screen reader has been read , the received orders will be resumed .
warnings have the next room priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning will hold the issue of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts ordinary text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just send a long text on a website , you can greet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet somebody welcome you who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the issue of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output is queu@@ e in the queu@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file will always be played , if a normal text order is interrupted by the introduc@@ tory sound as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text entries . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen re@@ members , there are no particular actions when they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to read by &amp; kt@@ ops ; please proceed to Not@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Not@@ if@@ ications . the map card not@@ if@@ ications appears .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads no mess@@ aging .
if this setting is selected , not@@ if@@ ications for which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that your conversation occurs when somebody men@@ tions your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop down to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can input the properties of the desired speaker . default choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card Card as a top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a specific event of a particular application . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the specific application . as the last option , the action will be applied to fru@@ ition , which was defined under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all not@@ if@@ ications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the above messages as follows :
use the button Save to store settings in a file . use the button to load the settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries will be deleted unless all notification will be deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output , the speaker , the voice , the voice , the voice and pitch . additionally , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is using SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ? &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked my bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ated ener@@ ge@@ fier ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , the first proposition must begin , as only the first proposition must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump or cancel and cancel , even if the language is not directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ by @-@ mar@@ gin@@ alization filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can change its settings or add other audio @-@ mar@@ gin@@ alization filters , however it will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
in the sim@@ pl@@ est study , you can learn the device selection and give you text to read . check the speaker button again , change some features and check out how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . for this , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with the pre @-@ read can begin , as only the first set must be processed , and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you will then stop writing files on the map card orders , even if the language support does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ rate monitor is automatically set up if you start a kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . don &apos;t be shut off , only removed . don &apos;t change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ z@@ cross @-@ characteristic filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and app@@ end a tab@@ ulator mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( tab@@ ular characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set @-@ by @-@ rate monitor is the drawing of character .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , news , or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ers .
if you have removed from the normal Sat@@ rate poly@@ ure@@ ment filter , you can insert this back by clicking the in &amp; kt@@ ops ; included the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
in the card box , you can write the menu settings for the application . the card box will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words , no speaking properties will be specified .
use of the most suitable microphone , which has all properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit , choose &amp; kt@@ ops . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; but the speaker , the most originally set properties .
select the method for entering the desired speech properties , by clicking on one of the selection kno@@ bs .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have priority before other features . you can also place several markings .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is treated , this will always be used as a priority . the only case where you might know the attribute language is available , if you know that a particular application text is sent to another language than that in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area , the most common one is to delete , click on the selection button and then use on actors that meets the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it starts . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer &apos;s crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops were finished . probably you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , it may be a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output above AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music at the same time . if I stop a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA will perform that the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . references for potential solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ fin@@ t@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for Festival from the Internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use them in Festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fest@@ ival@@ int / Vo@@ ices the new voice . as a guide , please send the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio , there is a setting speed . so that works , you must be able to install the program so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable P@@ ATH . some Synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive can offer itself on the map card for speaking at speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l @-@ file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ converting filter , and put the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t make it read that web pages will be read with a female voice . I created a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1,@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the X@@ SL file del@@ etes files to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I &apos;ve been added to your own animation filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not get back any more sat@@ in or back . on the map of the card , the order is only taken out of a set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ru@@ by signs , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you must not filter out . use for these signs instead a filter for the proposition recognition .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) AL@@ SA is available on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ sh@@ t@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the G@@ ST @-@ register before using the G@@ ST @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ us@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with audio output . if your system counts too , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text when you start a text order and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de supports not any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will still be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speaking speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar hung archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for language skills are created by default . some of them have a running time dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian rules ) . the configure parameter displays the configure parameter , which causes the passing of adjustment .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target .

before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if your language skills are working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , which is open source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions that are supplied with the Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions .
this voice sets the Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in early development stage . un@@ zip the software in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must select a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distribution . choose Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ synthes@@ izer . then , Festival uses the le@@ x@@ ik@@ ali analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete voice output system . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; needed Di@@ ph@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from german texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
with this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices to the language synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder will be installed , but in the folder / lib / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , the ro@@ uting and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is shown ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical equipment and their drivers must already be operational and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can display at all and allows setting the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers will need to be loaded by adjusting the following files corresponding to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded if the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . in the start of the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the platform is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and rele@@ asing the relev@@ ance . by marking the settings non @-@ again @-@ ask , the definition will be defined permanently . at the next start@@ up of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are grey shown , the settings can only be viewed , the settings are not possible . in the system management mode , you can click on the lower right end of the module . it is required to input the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces are used for the management of the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . all available functions can be performed :
the settings are shown on network interfaces by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only the basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to extend the dialog with other options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from an DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be required at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option Manu@@ ally , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be configured using TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address the desired TCP / IP address must specify the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values used in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can find if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off of switched network device can be activated by selecting the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off , if necessary , disable an activated network device by selecting the list and click on the interface ....
specify the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subjects .
if there is more than a network interface , the interface is required to the network in which the Gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name due to the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is required to address only IP addresses , DNS solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine &apos;s name for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ s name resolution allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified value . DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a contract and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons or below in the list .
by clicking the button menu ... from the group box to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the dialog of New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you must enter the DNS address of the DNS server , and then click the button Add . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group box to the name resolution , choose one entry and then click on the Edit .... It will display the dialog Edit .
the list named well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting the DNS server . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS @-@ servers .
usually , the list contains some examples known as some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses will be supported . this is still in the test version of IP to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computers and click Add .... The New alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computers and click the button to add . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog button is shown .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ mach@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphic user like k@@ package or the installation tool of your di@@ str@@ o .
for this case , the Q@@ t and &amp; B installation will suff@@ ice ; but additionally , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended by users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network machines are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed .
this area may not replace other knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC are medi@@ ated in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) and IPv@@ 5 has never found large distribution . therefore , IPv@@ 6 is expected to pass through in the near future . therefore , this description is focused on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which addresses the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to activate a valid IP address ; if available , the IP address can &apos;t be used easily !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded during the Internet , so its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all calcul@@ ators are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ direction .
the address address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files you are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically in DSL connections , so it will be surprised if there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is dis@@ car@@ ded by the scrip@@ ting in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another state as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a sigh@@ ting program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which was the answer of a question that my wife was : how much longer does it work if you do it ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; put the tape back and reads the exciting information on the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ judi@@ ces on the tape , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the device is looking for the right index on your record . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be re@@ created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by the failure of the band .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change in symbol for the band , that the bond for the band was solved and displays a message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without a danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; used to be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band @-@ types must form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not comply with form@@ att@@ ing data . this process does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape &amp; k@@ dat ; usually form@@ at@@ ted a form@@ att@@ ing of tape , DA@@ T drives doesn &apos;t need to be form@@ at@@ ted .
after entering the band name and the capac@@ itor , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape are lost , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you must select the file to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
mark a viewing profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in a local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button on the local file tree , and select the ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings will open for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folders .
mark the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog settings for ver@@ ification . in this dialog , you can check once your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can restore the restore , the files , which are to be restored , will be marked on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include record for tape drive . only the selected file or folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings dialog for rest@@ oring . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the job folders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the process , as well as data through@@ put and remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index to two types from tape :
this allows a viewing profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a viewing profile :
the current work folder , where the f@@ use is to be done . the list of the secured files will be automatically updated accordingly .
for all folders that are listed under the backup files , that only the files are stored in the file system , such as the folder . folders that can be found on other file systems , can be viewed separately from tar regardless of the other file system .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be secured . only the files are secured since then .
the file &apos;s name , which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file from tar . this causes all files to be secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings you can set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path needs to refer to the non @-@ re@@ tic variant of the band device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be in@@ hib@@ ited to the drive . at some drives this is necessary to be done before reading or writing operations .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat ; it tries to lock up with the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work at all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the release of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ connect the band . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ size of your tape drives .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string account is machine name : seconds , where the name is the whole name of the system , on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar can manage . even other tar versions should work while it does not work around incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup cover . this symbol is only active when a band is embedded .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ ite ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is intended for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system can get the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified display of the protocol files of your own system . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some extended functions , with which the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Samba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen picture , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log ; it will not appear instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; it is usually not possible with Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not usually have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to the selected string . the list of log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter screen . in default , a protocol line will only appear if shown in one of the columns , the filter string is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry in this point . if the string of filter search results will then be selected only with entries in the column file system , and then carry out in the filter line the name of a process , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you recognize the most important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error will be displayed using a show@@ y color as a log note . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off settings dialog .
if you only want to display certain process ( for example in the system log or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can download the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you would like to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to show all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu to open up additional sub@@ windows . as soon as you select a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a dedicated website to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information about the source squ@@ ats of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ ite ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system develops quickly to the standard for checking the system start @-@ up in the &amp; Linux . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine to System V In@@ it , without re@@ installing a new installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort , r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole bunch of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you would like to start running on another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should also lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you want to use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to perform a bit more using the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different positions after the program in@@ it and starts the first one which he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column , and you probably realize that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you have to change it , then you can fix / etc / in@@ ert by hand and then fix it by using the system if you restart the system and execute the following :
but how do I get all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no proper files are located . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : any of the scripts is written so that it is a argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line :
this would keep the htt@@ pd servers . in@@ it reads the name , and when it includes a K , the script will be called Stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ run@@ level that can only run htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to say not tri@@ vial , simply drag an entry from the field of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts either from Run@@ lev@@ eln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they draw out an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you simply drag this into a new range . to copy them from the menu Edit or select from the context menu , and then select in the target area - even if the same entry has previously existed in the action area .
the sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to add the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown in the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the various working areas ( availability , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ts ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the button button to change the Properties dialog . connect the button to accept the Properties button , to accept the changes in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . by default , the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) will be removed . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pre@@ ferences will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ les , and now the machine re@@ starts . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and modify the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type , like system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if any configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are just ending without any message when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or entry into the file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user tro@@ op . to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the user or group features .
some cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you can make advanced system settings , a card box will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional map cards may be installed , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management password will be published if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card box appears only if necessary for at least a embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , the constra@@ int limits are displayed in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation .
the map card groups provides information on the group &apos;s group levels . the user group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the box of the Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting this in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialogue features a list of users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the user menu or group or click on the matching add @-@ button of tool@@ bar . the Edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO Boot@@ manager to remove and modify the boot@@ password , remove , remove , remove , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , change and more .
