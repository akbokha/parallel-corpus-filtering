<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the text URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, you should not make an important decisions on translation, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web sites in the internet can be translated. other texts should translate you on the baby fish site itself, where you can insert texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & Konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about using & Konqueror; and the built-in functions you will find in the guide to & Konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Conqueror; to load, select Settings extensions.... open the card box tools and select the required modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard installation modules from the packet; add-ons. please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click the & Conqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; for crash, or the list of storming, if available, erase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module's viewing filter (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & Konqueror; menu bar with extras. by the module you can filter & Konqueror; 's current work list on different kinds.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & Konqueror; you can select Extras DOM tree... and thus open a new window with the DOM's root node. as default, the display starts with the root node of document, example: documenting, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root dust.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & Conqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & fsview; consists in forming a shell-called "Tree-Map." each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size has to possess that the sum of sizes of the subordinate objects of a object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & fsview; reflects the size of a folder or folder, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily detected, even if they can be seen far in the folder and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you can see.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation use the rectangles of meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can represent a depth for the light detection of the disables or the figure of another file selfdom such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if sufficient space is displayed at all, i.e., if sufficient space for representation is used, so you can specify the relative position of the labels in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of performances for Treemaps the rule is observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always maintained, and this framework will no longer be available. note that less space for the frame is lost, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The implementation is left to implement the surface of an entry for the subordinated entries. here, it is due to the labelling and avoidance of space losses incurred by frames that the rectangles are created as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal surface area for an entry via the menu entry. instead, a sample-pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent event, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & fsview; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets designed to be developed for use KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="57">Although & digious; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills available. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the resource conversion by libraw, DNG-Export and ICC-colour controls.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens, can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kgs; Programs is also & digious; an open source project. that means, it is dependent on the support of the end users. you should therefore contact problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digious; tries to make the problem of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you use the help menu, your web browser will open a page in the error system. all required information is already registered. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digious; is a project supported by a community. that means, if you have a regular user of & digious; ask for questions to other users of & digious; however, if you have questions to other users of & digious; in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digious homepage; visit news about shared versions and other information about & digious; learn more.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digiplug, is registration in the developer mailing list. guidance for notifications in the developer mailing list of & digious;</seg>
<seg id="64">When you launch & digious; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply type pagename or click on the folder symbol folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add so many folders as you would like. & digiplug, you will also use as an alarm library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folders. no picture will be changed. during the search of the stewards you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug, recursively the librarian path in his whole depth. you can't close any subfolder, unless there was any subfolder. this can be done in a hidden folder. do this by insertion a point in front of the folder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist will not have photos as symbols. you can change it as an album icon. this is then used as an album icon. further details can be found in the section Albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configured the Base folder, you can set up in & digiplug; you should learn to use your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to manage my albums and my stitcher in order to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Rohdatagulation: if you want to use the raw mode of your camera, it can also deal with it. if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported, you'll find a list of supported rough cameras in the Help | Rohkameraassist.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decodermal Settings and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">A video camera is easy to use, so that you can connect with your digital camera and you can download them directly in & digiplug. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by library gphoto2. of course, every medium and every card reader, which is supported by your operating system, work with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are introduced by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive. the camera will also use the camera transfer protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, remote software collection for digital cameras supporting a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports converting images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the calculator. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slowly outdated. & digious, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug, supports the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support. the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to display the thumbnails. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might be a thumbnail, or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digious; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digious; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in & digious; self-perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Pulling and dismantling pictures works everywhere: you can place a picture in another part of the Albenbauma, via the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture is not allowed in keywords, dates or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to start widest: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter will only be used for fields used in the symbol view. so the filtering is displayed on the filename only if this ind it is displayed as a symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure the albends dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; presents a organized view on your photo albums. these albums can be stored in a single album, where they were created on the hard disk, according to the name of their collection, in which the album was first created, sorted by the album, the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know what you need to do in your system. you must decide whether other accessing your photos will have to store if you want to save them on a reserving drive or on a network drive & etc; note that you need to switch to a bigger drive at some time.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you were able to organize enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; you will then publish a folder for images that you will print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning the photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation from original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend metadata in the setup page of the metadata in & digious; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can then save the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? and digiplug-Editor is available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now select any photo words, labeling and review. of course, you can choose the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you can use in other programs, or browse these categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogised pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then it is not a problem and can simply insert the images in the correct place. the sort of hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling a subtree on another. the changed keywords are pursued by & digious; updated while the subtrees are prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very coarse representation, since each bloc consists of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool for cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You most don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then catch some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence. the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title is possibly more important than the image itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer him about the viewer you've moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can also use any text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images in web galleries, then they will tell you a spell check-in for your wishes and / or the title of the web-gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the time before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was she not a boring planet from googleEarth? well, because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation right now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the Geolocalization are innumerable. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travels with geographic information. this displays the photos on the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the google maps view.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is found in the setup page of & digious; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonymous for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the camera, and if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name. after that, the name of a company or organization is used, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support Kommas nor Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonymous with the author): linked to the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this can be the title of a photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memorandum to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the vendor field to identify who owns the photo agency such as Reuters, or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a warehouse photo, the group / agency will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in the work with calculator is this, in the picture embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in a picture. & digiplug, in the near future, there will be such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: failure, record failure, blackouts, ECC, transmission errors, aging the storage media, restoring, redundancy, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative. in this section, things are problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data production company in the world, has some interesting statistics which cause some data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs this must be treated for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality which are longer expensive and much more expensive. there are offers about Gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 this piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it lies in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices, and they are not much more reliable than the cheapest ones, but you write much reliable. so it's about to select the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to faults even if you have just been written only. therefore, use a control environment to protect itself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control sum. despite this massive protection, they use chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs, but there is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to store the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs, of course, applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a not propriated format. then read the media with a description, date & author mark and then in a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of hardware and software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discotheques retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disrupture study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, Disks will last the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART may not determine these errors. these are in particular readers and publishing count. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. they can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus, protect themselves from the inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and grounded by the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. remember that not every plug bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care of protection against lightening and protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should also use any peripherals that can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage cabling, which also includes a phone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for modem. thus, you are ideal for the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines you will not really help you. even an failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in an interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against hypertension, these devices can automatically shut down battery energy. some models allow you to store your data and run down the system. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your host system is exposed to and compare his safety while avoiding the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be paid for less than & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS. this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you drive to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only available as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general securing solution. it's too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol and include a backup and a distributor stored in the offer. so they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system calls and btrfs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody can tell you when a transmission error occurred to you. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable networks are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seem to be one of two candidates to deal with and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will be available for & Linux; and Windows is available in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used for and is also available for & Linux. but it's not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the job systems. in case of notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it is currently limited to any damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux. no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro coins. so do not have anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by one data loss. so, secure your data frequently after a plan and test it before you do something dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hits locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasteration always means not a local store. bring your backup up the stairs into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files must be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy of a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two periods: the total securing and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time. this fuse comes to a versioning system next with the exception that it is only abdicapped and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can set up easily on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer rsync only copies the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you to discover and restore losses in the same time. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every other dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copying the images on the next generation of media, applications, systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With that valuable images will survive the next 40 year, that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because you should remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable for the future because of your nature, you have to consider it all today with caution. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself as the current system goes backwards. the less version you have used in the past, the more easier to rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is currently available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated sheet or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg whether your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modify the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is able to read it, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can be so lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. the downside is that it is relative many administrative information, but not as many management information, but not as many as TIFF. this format will we recommend to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression salm (deflate). however, it is necessary to save your images in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open-image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to use metadata. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. the file information is stored in a file itself. the file information is stored in an extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers attract it before an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, to archive file. however, it can come to problems with the link between the file file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. in addition to the activities of DCMI communities, work and community work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images are on the camera mode, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your rough archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered process you can use external programs. if you have the images again with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut down under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them first in web galleries, add them to MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera-interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; you will find a description as you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your nighttime database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect this with the computer, turn the camera on display mode and switch them. you will find a further description on the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start camera-interface, it tries to connect with your camera. when the connection is made, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom of the camera. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol of file assignment will be displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with sidebars Properties and Metadata from the camera-interface you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file features and the photo information to be stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata is showing the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS etc of the image. this information is the same as the metadata-sidebar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then the selection of all photos. this will download all photos from their camera into a single album in & digious;. by downloading, the photos will be sure to check if the pictures are securely removed in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods of & kde; as soon as you select the photos, use the button Download and then select Selected. the button Selected is extended until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these pictures have been selected until now. in this case, the new pictures are selected by a star in the front panel. if you select this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the buttons, a dialog box will be sorted into which the photos can be stored. the list of existing albums can be sorted, displayed in the section My albums. select the list from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After choosing the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; invites the photos of the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. if you only want to delete the button, you must select it first and delete the chosen button.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover from the camera, and the photos are not removed in the trashcan of & kde; you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully removed from the camera. if you want to delete the camera memory, you should read it out about the camera memory because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not very meaningful names. the filenames are usually reutilized, after the photos of the camera are loaded again. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the photos of various recording criteria into the same album. therefore, it may be useful, the date and time when the image was taken to integrate in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and datastal-based sub-bs. if you use this option, will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer will open three more options which will be carried out before the photos are stored on the record. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied to the IPTC array. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than the standard format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. to add the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera filenames, you have the possibility to change the file name in lowercase letters. or in uppercase letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digious; for a photo used, is shown below the name, which will be displayed under the name. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera's window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to carry out an automatic spin during charging. not all cameras are ready. in the section page metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic spin is usually turned on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, and when you want to switch off the automatic turn, use the button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was done, it can be made available to download on the picture data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. in the section page meta meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug. if you want to change this option, use the button below and select the option data-based signatures at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button downloading. then choose uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can choose the files being uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digious; you, where the images will be loaded up. select the folder dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to launch the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. that's a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers there can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agent can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forget later, where exactly the photo was done, you can open a browser which indicates the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug, the user can locate to document the location, or simply want to document the location data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the image? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction, saddle and card referencing. there are at least three ways to achieve this? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and recently over the manual input of well-known places.</seg>

<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia for the close explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery reduces the image quality, because PNG is a loss-free algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time to spin and packing. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. 1: low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file, you can compress the deflate compression of TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm is not working freely.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you have the loss of quality loss and file size far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata is not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it has become a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default timeout is that all green pixels are identical to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines. if you use this option, fix this problem with a minimal loss of detail. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid-pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the whiteboard is used immediately. otherwise, when set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white off is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that in four steps received more details into the top-lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the Spitzlichter, so the parts of your images are inserted, because of the inability of your camera to capture the top-in white in the settings. lastly, use some unusual findings, because they can construct the top-lights in various Rosatönen. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the plants.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digious therefore try to construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and it should be customized for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you'll probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug. to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A digital image process is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrew.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and Drapw supplies you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. according to some tests, it looks like AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient), but it is interesting to look for a quick solution to the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a colorless correction, as you are carried out during the pipe conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the colour information and gives instructions like this one should be given. there are also LCMS and digiplug. information such as the colour information of a colour space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>

<seg id="316">The paint administration view is an alternative towards Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colouring not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be made to the camera maker and model you should fit. not all profiles are created on the same way. currently, there are some, such as Canon, which do not have color mapping or GammakorSurgery. this means that you need to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can be re-delivered. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very satiated, instead of converting to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obvious what colour profile is intended for for what is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; viewed images and image processing; many modules support which are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">In case your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. then select a list of available modules. then, these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond that you will also find some in the context menu of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for assignments carried out by modules can be set in the menu on Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can see the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adapts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other boxes switch on the metadata, or out, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all cameras supported on the left side. if you want to use this camera, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode. currently there are serial settings, USB- and USB / FireWire mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera box. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / or, indicate that you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer, to display and switch on display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digiplug; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera amodel and port manually. after reading your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">Any way you can select any name for your camera. if you have more than one camera in the menu, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">You can display the talk of &gt; pictures in the trashcan. you can set the talk about the images in the trashcan; in the deleting of a photo in an album. you will find more details when deleting the photos and deleting another album.</seg>

<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digious; used to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected using Settings design from the tool bar. a preview of available design is highlighted below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digious; find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digious; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correcting and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking on a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug. so, they are not part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, enlarging factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar becomes quick access to the most common features.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing vary your photos. however, the original photo will change, before you use File Save or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you don't have the original photo to recover when you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save as you can.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Edit menu or restore the button restore recovery in the tool bar. then you lose any change that you have been using in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting or restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should do the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to the backbone and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the back or restore button in the tool bar, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the menu. if you have made changes on the current picture, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zoom in which you are using Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in toolbar or the entries in the menu bar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode. you come in full screen mode. you come to the normal view, where you don't want to change the toolbar. if you don't like this, you can start this in the setup dialog by & digiplug; you can see this as the main window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture you can print in the image file, and get the default & knot; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. you will select only the images with standard methods and select from the Album Export printer. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available, even in image processing. it will appear when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same horseman lets the sidebar appear or disappear again into the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can insert or insert the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are formed after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the button user or simply switch to the next picture, the labels will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, it is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows a document scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The Keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the stitch tree, and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & digious session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adjusted dynamically to the given search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities looking for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when typing keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they will be stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking of the respective boxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection, if you want to select a selection with a keyword, please read the Keypassword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keywords and search results. if necessary, only the cutting rate of these two is displayed. all set keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">"" "you can also tags and drop them. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. after that, a dialog box will ask you if you want to set the keyword." ""</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar tag. the Keyword filter is reduced to no keyword which has been selected by Strg + a. afterwards, a keyword from the right stitch tree has been drawn and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched on settings below settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule, and note that it would be one or its, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is sought in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, that is a name or a string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search about all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then grouping the button. the options look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why not listed picasaweb or Flickr? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mostly adapted it & digious implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a colorless workflow, you can get the colors made from your camera or scanner that you can get the colors on your monitor or scanner that you may print or publish the colors that you want to print or publish them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes on color management, everyone wants to know what knobs he must press for the results which he would like to press. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to make you adequate background information about color management. in addition, you should make your own information on color management so that you will receive the requested results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your imagery meets all the criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about paint management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenses are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for all so easy, then why should one use another colour space and make thoughts about paint buzzling?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can see below is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufisenshaped area, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using a few larger colour spaces, so visit Bruce Lindbloom and then click Info and then click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to do my monitor when I chose to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you have to cope with your monitor, since sRGB uses the circle. when you're working as in the color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool produces five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to create a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abused, automatic and contrast from the menu, auto-correction attempt to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which seems best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaling on the whole picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shady. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Decreasing: this method adjusts the illumination factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity can be as flat as possible. sometimes, almost every light range in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces just trash. it is a very powerful operation, which causes some miracles in an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic off: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue canal. it is determined the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogrammrange.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminance of RGB values of a picture by postpone the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a new jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white comparison of & digious; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white off of a high-quality photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-comparison correction is slightly restricted there for a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform too far from the original image. if you can perform the white off in the rough mode, so you will be able to pull off the white mode in the mode mode, so your possibilities will be better out to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white abequinism protected by the copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. they start it via the menu entry colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The thumbnail can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and preview of the target image will be adjusted. if you want to see the original whitish window, then it will be enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right up, a histogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful as soon as you can choose one parameter. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow of alignment lets you improve the shadowels of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette to use this button and then click anywhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white abused. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overshift indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of pixels is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white comparison. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store exactly this. every setting of the white abnormaly you can set it in a text file and recharge them later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences sets all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be shown as your original. if you store it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codiary depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. but this encoding also requires more turntables, calculative time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens up the same dialog as the processing of images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be used to rate colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under shades of key correction. this tool provides you with an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same error, and you can always find the same corrections. in the manual for sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool colour effects produces four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of the extra light. this had the effect that the lighter ranges darker and the colors were inverted. this result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panel. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar eclipse. the original image is (1) and the edit intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that it makes a stronger contrasts that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an enhanced color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure. Velvias is highly saturated colors, but also some photographers, especially those who have barely visible landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures, the filter can take the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to fix the color contra and luminance of your photos with the tools in the menu. as soon as you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the opposite problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce your saturation instead of increasing. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma is based on the exposure of the exposure. even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool, you need only the area of shooting. concrete the three slats below the HistoProgram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a graphite of intensity values, an histogram, an active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slitting can be changed into the inside and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is to move the regulator and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be considered. the preview is dynamic, with the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted, whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic result is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the uppermost for the dark tones, medium for light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the shadows, middle and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Application values: the outputs allow manual values for each area. there are also two knob values that can be used to evaluate the output values, for example, to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: using this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and shop: using these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be stored and later loaded again. the Gimp's level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When using this mode and the three color pipettes, the procedure will be re-adjusted automatically for all the shadows, means and solar cells. enable the paint pipette to set you and click on the preview of the HistoProgram for Rot-, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Excess Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels, i.e., you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the entrances applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be dynamic depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to enter the channel modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps further.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a track to the right, i.e. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright sounds are darkened with darker cutlets and the corresponding picture pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value. create a dot on this line and move it then, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and shop: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you can have created can be loaded in filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp article format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shad-, medium and sun tones. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload indeer controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. here, it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance canal. shadow and sun tones were applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the color shavers of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer to imaging.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how you can fix the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison via his own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. when you position this in the image a vertical line in the histogram will display the respective colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you want to keep Luminance, the image will also retain the appropriate colors. this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate colour components, as the channel-mixer is to reduce your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes visible in the same place in the colour canal and their sound pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion into which you can reduce the farction first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can save you later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Excess Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and you can view the combined result of all channels, i.e., you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph was always fascinating about your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white was a step, since color pictures can be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolling profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford Station 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a green linkfilter. this looks great, at all the scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfiltered: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange arrow filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orangter.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate Moonlight to day-time. similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and middle tones as he added a little cold in the shadow oils. this is very similar to the process of drawing a pressure and the re-development in a sepia schooner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three-dimensional texture of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and the changed below (2) to be seen. the parameter's relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photos is not easy task. to keep the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streamed eye. under the frame, the module can be restarted from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. through a thin line and a wide frame (ideally suited for black and white pictures), it is sealed with a nice three-dimensional frame and decoratively adds a frame frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of the frame is in percent. value range is limited by 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture is larger than the original, but the original thing is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple formatted text in a picture at any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply place the text and place it with your mouse. you'll need to adjust text, color from the color space and the character set. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame for the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button" "" "OK" "". "after the picture is stored once, the text part of the image is changed. it cannot be changed anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool stencil you can use templates via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. you must, however, take the PNG file format and should be adding maximum compression size (9) to the size of the file size; if you want to add templates, please send an e-mail to the & digious templates; mailing list digious-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you must set your template folder with the button base folder. select the folder where you copy the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, a tree view is reflected in the template structure of the template's template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview, three buttons are located with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the displayed picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, you must shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move under the template's template. take the image and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply templates to your image. then the image is then adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; puts three different tools available for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates particularly in dark areas, graceful images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look sharper. actually it does not use a bit more psychometric. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without a focus as well as most digital images need to be summarized. elements are smaller than the resolution. elements are smaller than the resolution, so that sharp edges can be printed with only minimal edges. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally need more intolerable than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often used by internal sharpening. images in the raw-format, however, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already turning a hot filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpener value. that can be correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should use it carefully, as the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the edge of the edges, but amplifies the usable technique for sharpening a picture the tool refocus. in general, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to correct the image a bit soft, is much easier than to sharpening. use the tool to use with the menu entry and experiment some with settings. the thumbnail on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the front panel shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce often good results and should be tried first. if you make the sharpness, make noise and the impression of graten in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radials. they should therefore defuse images on the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount provides the percentage between the original and the wisely image that will be added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB-value and the use difference. thus, there can be a minimal difference in order to be applied to a edge of the filters. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded, and therefore beauty mistakes in faces, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2) and the processed picture was applied with a radius = 6.0, the amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighting filter-filters from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to revert a picture to & quot; in which it is a better approach to sharpening the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharper mask. they can usually start the use of a sharper mask. you can start it from the menu by using colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular process works much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung also has a very long tail, which is far from the source pixies, which is far influenced by the original pixel pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is influenced even very strongly from the remote pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circuit sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results if your image is very unsharp, but should pay attention to Heiligenvouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you accept artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a high value is the image to further contaminate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoyed artefacts. if you use a value zero, you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrimal font: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, it is possible to generate good results, especially if you select large numbers for a circular sharper or the slap. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all access, color and intensity corrections before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later left uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp mascots produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to always produce unsharp mask. even under optimal conditions, it can never be the effect of defuse. for the Viennese filters there is always at least as good as the infinity mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better than the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image that has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the focus is due to insufficient light for car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of shareholding in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller glaze the sharpense of the area has been darkened, thereby causing a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinent allows a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove unrequired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are highlighted below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoother place above the image. weighted more homogeneous regions for smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should be obtained from details that no sharpness is needed. please note that the details should always be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="520">Accuracy dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a high value of wave-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value as suitable to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to produce the image geometry of the image. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular gradual integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is selected, there should also be small selected. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothness and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low. but it doubles the runtime. therefore we recommend it to allow him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store exactly this. correct adjustment of image errors can be hereby stored in a text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how pickles can be corrected using small artefacts. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey was caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digipence; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool will be available to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor cameras from digital cameras, you can read it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a graceful noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled by the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large numbers increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can be adjusted to the image and the color in him can be adjusted and adjusted smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the filter. this value sets the pixel pitch to be fixed. if it is increased, the adaptive filter image details will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not be obtained and smoothing or dirt takes up again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response from the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or addicts can occur. put it on a value close to the maximums if you want to remove a weak rushing or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings will not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamble tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger than to increase. however, it also contaminated the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges can occur when it is too high, the noise and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. it can remove ramps and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the resulting output is applied with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. to sharpness the image a bit soft, is fortunately much easier than to sharpening the image with the menu entry and experiment with the deposit box on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for residual penetration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, scratches, compression permissions and local errors that occur in digital, original or retroactively digitalized images, and thereby receive the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the texturing is developed with another tool, the image error correction, which was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrei and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it produces some compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards that correct in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restarted like a photo with a similar smoky smoker.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grainy on the faces. the original image is below (1) and this corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures reduced to an old colour photo that was used with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which can be seen from the scannerlighting and photopapier. the original image below (1) can be seen and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos that were equipped with a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by the copyright of Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially high-quality rough-mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to detect the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark picture to the correct image. note that the assistant is reviewing the last dark picture and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result within the image. the thumbnail shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are emphasized in all departments.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighboring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear turns (1-dim) or a group of linear turns (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to Pixelblock are drawn, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn, to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color picture, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious correction is a tool in order to correct the Vignetscape, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can not even light up the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vigorcovert quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by using the light that can reach the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has drawbacks. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Blendenfilter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise faulty effects may occur through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large-layer areas of today's felt film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent spectrum of a Centerfilter. the tool is used without this filter. the algorithm is protected by a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three racks, you can control the Vignetmask correction filter, and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, or by chance to compensate an optical filter with an aperture of 1, or by chance to compensate a greater degree of Vignetmask, to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, Contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetscape correction. you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the regulator only need to adjust positive values as you just need to raise the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the coating of the target picture, allow the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma using zero and use gradation from the & digial; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetmask correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the image in the corners and (2) the image-stronger image and contraction correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digious hew; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric decay. colorations can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric deterioration of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar aspect effect, but laughing at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient Grades corrects the distant corners to that of the second gradient. if you combine these two geometrical crats almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values can be corrected tonically-shaped distortion and positive values versensed distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth density. this value works more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the "corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thereby rejects a correct gradient of the first degree. negative values increase during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. values you use for your image, are stored and used as default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnor disc-shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you perform an image and perform a tonal correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction for you find this tool a vertical and horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonnand / ververular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a ververular distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Menu Transformers Cut out of the image processing or via zoom-knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tontonal correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives as such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings are the perspective so correct that if you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tontonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can also simulate two parameters set for viewing and film Sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO-knob changes the amount of film grainy and dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter caps are mixed from infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film material used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image has been set under (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter film module is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grainy on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, which is to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer big silver-grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-style effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get this special, Galerie-like, road photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, so you must use this Filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the Körner. the default value is, although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-style display applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digial filter; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and breastfeeding are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper select the brush-size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for big pictures. smooth it controls the glass or, from the other side view the hingness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious filter used; filter coal-drawing uses paint and intolerance gradients in order to define a stuffed cable. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch for you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the size of the pin and adjust the contrast (glaze).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of charcoal recording filters. the original image (1) and the changed image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art through distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: share the image in cells and makes it look like it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelength 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art using unsharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom: wipe off the image along stone-shaped lines which comes from a center. this simulates the unsharpness a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unharp: blacks the image by rotating the pixels. this simulates the diffuse of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wipe the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement: blacks the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the unsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Plasticating unharp: catch the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright colours. this is ideal to create romantic portraits, glamour photos or for adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütt: blacks the image by random shift in pixels and simulates the unsharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent impurp: finds the paint pool in the picture and catch it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and created it through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore use this calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make reentropes on your image. thus, it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fisher changes the optical effect of the drop on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold a range of shelves; for example, use a range of raindrops. use the range for example to check the area, e.g. a vision that should remain free. if you start the filter to remove Regentropes, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the reentroped filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through skewers or rotating in the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the transformers turning on or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you zoom out a picture and see the details? how can you invent a picture of the resolution? how can you invent the missing information, or guess it? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size. choose the size change in menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size modifies a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge of an image. & digious algorithm uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are highlighted below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain a aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the value of the original size is maintained in the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to produce the image geometry of the image. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and store are used exactly to this. every single image can be saved as text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of a photo inflatable by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear Standard augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated operation to create a picture. to cut a photo with the mouse, squeeze the mouse button and draw the rectangle, then create. you will then see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus, you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting off. you can draw the size of the corners when you draw on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle, simply drag it to the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut-section, use the button The Cut button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save file Save or File Save as in the Menu file to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbnail you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the Tool Folder aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a high-format or cross format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and in the cross format is assigned the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Followers aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always equal to whether you can use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically unlock the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set the max. ratio knob to the area for cutting on the widest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool allows to cut down aspect ratio (Horizontal or vertical). if you are using the default dimension, these settings will be displayed as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will be reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of merge help allow help to blend help, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-reels, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a dividing that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell, or the stuffed leaves of a sunflower. it shows in all sorts of things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden split is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used with the old Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two progresses. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that is usually followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liqueer relief lines when you put an image. these help are highlighted below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third elasparagus, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the image along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be just because its eye can be done without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Tritriangles from the above discussed golden spiral. their barriers are the average points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equisangled triangles. diagonal to this lines can be more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create a effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your picture focus on one of the crosspoons and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, it happens easy to keep the camera completely vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things rotated around a corner. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. select the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are stated in degrees. with the button preferences, you can reset the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">To make your help the module requires a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse into the picture preview to position the two lines. after reading it above an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is the function transformers to use from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatic Cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing glut the picture a bit after rotation. however, observe the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are performed to be a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas which are created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas which are created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you get injoyous dirty holes on the corners. a possibility to report this is to cut the picture with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to shift a part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can launch this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press on preferences, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown right from the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse into an important point, like the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have performed the shot, the picture becomes a bit confused. for a single hole, this effect is usually negligible, but two chings produce twice as much desolation and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After cutting, the picture has unfair triangular holes in the corners. possibility to eliminate it, cut the picture with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore compiled by your system and, in some cases, by the way such libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphs, each in an own window. in the beginning, when you start & kgraphviewer, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the tool bar will only open the icon file and open the (empty) list. click on the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; select the main window as shown in the lower screen image:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the character space. you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graphite.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just been changed in & kgraphviewer; uploaded file from another program is displayed, the following window is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; may also realize your decision, so that later, you can change your choice later; you can set up the menu settings cgraphviewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphendure outside a current & kgraphviewer; the instance will open, & eg; in file browser or command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; the instance will open or want to display the graphs in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change them with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program start, you can open all graphs at your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unloaded graph. it produces representations according to the spring spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, the synonymous with statistically multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for uneven graphs a springboard model layout. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold Heuristics and includes a multi-purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm subordinates the knots of circular in accordance with the Description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which can then be programmed by a shell. the command should give graphendatei as a parameter, and the calculated layout of graphs after stdout in xdot format. with such a layouts, you can change the graphite; -algorithms special options, or change the graphite with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images of geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo will be localised. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to make a possible correlation over time and localization. this file contains of course data that have been recorded at the same time, such as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, the automatic correlation is carried out in red. GPS trace data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera is expected to be converted to GMT. this can be done with time zone. this can be done with time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time variance is a higher deviation for the GPS-time and camera quality. the deviation among them will be merged. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big difference between camera and GPS, you can put these boundaries here and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have to use a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog lies with a call for the next notice, you only have to use the button OK to put the data in the current picture.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and be found. select this in the relevant region and increase it again. the height must always be selected manually. the height must always be selected manually. the map can always be switched between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is using to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages. the character set is encoded as UTF-8, to enable the best possible internationalisation.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the riders are allowed to select all the albums. you need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right hand, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below, the Albenvorschau and the text can appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely explaining. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the image displayed. otherwise, the image will be shown directly with your standard screen, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your images. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything you will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, EXIF information will be stored in the new images as well.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. this also affects the file size. all other settings are explained by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnails, which are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user to how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can see whether error during production has occurred. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to closing the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform base operations such as laings, zooming or shifts. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images from JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising since there is no compression of the colour information. this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module's digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy anywhere from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out Exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG-video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base risk. you can also add audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled for the correct video format. in addition, you can select a background colour for the Diaschau. in addition, you can create a background color for your DVD / SVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images which should be packed into MPEG Diaschau. then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then enumerated in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you want to re-adjust the other settings, select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default, and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds. the speed of the image is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth shift.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be stopped next. in doubt you should set them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, so you can start the creation of the movie using the button code. depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the Diaschau if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coils or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets on the right down button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The pressure assistant allows multiple images to be printed along a sheet paper. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is useful for you to improve or using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software created from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that will be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button you can look at the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize conversion process. the first option decides to adjust the camera settings for the white off. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to process your pictures frequently, or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG than memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, or stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Stacking mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are nearly identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if this is generated in an earlier attempt. however, this progress is not available. a preview of progress is not available as far as the conversion progress is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a record. you can set the prefix, starting numbers and timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from ImageMagick packet. you can reduce the image larger image or enlarge. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo format. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images. more pictures can be drawn to the list of the images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the pictures window is displayed by you. you can add more images on the thumbnail. you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog. for the last chosen picture, a preview on the right is shown.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and make it possible to add them to the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures you will remove the selected pictures from the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the New Message window of your e-mail client. you have to add only the addresses and the subject to the subject. you have to get selected pictures from you as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions for the size of e-mails. it might be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the images for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures file format and file the original files in JPEG format, the original exifdata will be added to sening pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down, so you can view the status in search of errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically. by selecting the button, you can lock this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module, advanced diaschau appears to have a window with questions like you want your slideshow. you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">OpenGL transitions in the presentation are using very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, as otherwise the Diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc; let's go.</seg>
<seg id="889">The images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order, so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should not know this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between you can select. randomly chooses any transition between images another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a tool bar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can hold the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the complete number of images in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="898">Once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kPhotoAlbum; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, are now available in every group, i.e. in people, places and in group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories, for which you have typed your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumbnails. in the following, each for itself is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse to the entry, the browser's view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your work area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you have their own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button, which is located on the right outside on the tool bar. please note that you can have the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display yourself with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image for each individual person is to be displayed. in order to see this, you must select the image file editor, as shown in the image, and select the image for the corresponding person. in the Ansizing window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are searching for the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for assessing the image properties. this dialogue can be seen on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string or descriptions of the images in the field or description, you can also enter a date according to that text, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a part of the full date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, not Anne Helene is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this guide:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the website of & kPhotoAlbum; and check the quick entry, the screen shots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoAlbum; and you can start the demo in the first dialog, if you start & with photoalbum; for the first time you start or select in menu Help the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. subsequently, some example images are loaded and you can try the features of & kPhotoAlbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kPhotoAlbum; as a program-associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this corpus can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this LEICA will show you about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time line can show you several different time units. each case shows a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time line can be interactively using the following ways: you can change the displayed entries look out of the database (if you select a date on the preview pane) and also display the current date of the currently displayed pictures, if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the time bar by pressing the mouse button, and drag the mouse over the linear time line, i.e. the time information, draw. if you select a area, you will only show pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeframe.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoAlbum; includes two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is in & kPhotoAlbum; integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the user's book, built in & kPhotoAlbum; integrated version which you can create about the menu HTML... call.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages you will have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and target. in the following, each area will be detailed.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the titles and description of a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kPhotoAlbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created, which is to be seen on the site. check out information about the export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. for example, you can see that all pictures from a party are obvious. for example, that all pictures from a party are obvious. please note that all pictures are exported from a party. currently, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how HTML-pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why these are not been made specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. thus, those who have to consider your website and have a monitor, which have the maximum resolution 800x600, no images allow for example to have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time you've defined. so he can browse your images with low resolution, which can look at a lower transmission time, as well. if he wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, you specify the different folders and URL to where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder, in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to all future images. here you can select either a folder or by KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this is really visible all for the viewer. if you have created for the basic subfolder, a web browser after the pages are created, you should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser should start the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that you have created HTML files not yet in final destination folder, you have to manually copy them manually. so the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final target of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolders can be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only setup options described are all three on basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name will set you into the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kPhotoalbum; you can, of course, create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you want to add a HTML page for viewing the pictures, then you will need to take with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even made.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoAlbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. they can import others into your database. these features are excreted with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in that the images can be stored in the file, or whether in the file is stored in the file, that you can put all the pictures together into the file, and the file size is so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file to either from the File Menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, the images of the URL, which you have indicated in the folder of the .kim file, will be searched carefully. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file via the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images will be described, which you can catch on the File Menu... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialogs is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">By option Manually into the .kim file you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the auto option Automatic to copy the .kim file copy & kPhotoAlbum; the pictures are automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most pictures have already been compressed using JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to compress the export file, simply select the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximally limit image size. if you would like to send your friends images, the .kim file would be very large, as the .kim file would be very big. here you can tell the size that each picture should be up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import, select & kPhotoAlbum; exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import account consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, after that, in which folder that import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are personified to the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog window, which are the categories of importing to imported file and which categories will match these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can see the categories of the categories from imported file with the categories of your current database. an example for this will be shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: when you look at images, you want to watch images within different picture groups & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps (1) for the information on your images, via (2) the search and see, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities go through.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was extended and now it takes care of your videos. at many places in this handbook it is talking about pictures, but often they also closes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& PhotoAlbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can back with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy on a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoAlbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this at future Starts automatically. if you like to start a different database in & kPhotoalbum; you can start with the -c option. as an example: kPhotoAlbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry settings cphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user's booking you will be explained in the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call recording possibilities and options for viewing. for each setting, a detailed help is available that you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can define different properties, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On check out the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories were already mentioned in the section. in the dialog options, you can set up complete assembly groups, i.e., all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medial as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setup options that are available to you in the list of members, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoAlbum; shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system means KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. check out information on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules. they are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have an help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together among each other applications, it can be tested that modules with & photoalbum; demo database can be tested first with the demo database, before you call it on your own pictures using the command &gt; kPhotoAlbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell you, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules over KIPI are very different, so that some modules with & kPhotoalbum are very different; not functioning. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications which can also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this kind of order is not supported, so it simulates for some modules the order for albums, so that you can use the & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kPhotoAlbum; the current album, which matches the current viewpoint, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here comes & kPhotoAlbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & PhotoAlbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all the people, then each entry into this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used to define the category you've defined in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you would like to use the category people, so do if you have chosen to view people and give the module to this one.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kPhotoalbum are not compatible; you can remove them from the list of modules. run the setup dialog and select the modules that modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window at the top of the tool bar. at the moment the tool bar will see you. currently, we will not see any information about your images. in the section we will show you no information about your pictures, but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see any picture with notes, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if shown on all images Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen were included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you like, you can see these comments by using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by selecting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kPhotoAlbum; as you can use them again, when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shift of images within the list: if you are shown for example a family celebration or shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can find that the used names are moved up to the top that can locate and assign persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen remarks for each image, you may need to edit all selected pictures and add these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the picture of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and add the menu item more than once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that displays the USA as transducts. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the feature catalogue it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. additionally, you can also use an entry to an existing or new category. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically. see that.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the dialog, by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move it out. you can also make your own window by selecting it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and the look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also make a frame complete. if you want to see this window again later, use the button options... and click here to see window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the listing images in your browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you do not have a filter. you can see the size of thumbnails, by simply scroll down the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easily.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you need a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the removing button or select in the menu Edit selection. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoAlbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures with & kPhotoAlbum; you can also use pictures somewhere, so that & kPhotoAlbum; you will need to record the pictures somewhere, so that & kPhotoAlbum; you can see the view of & kPhotoAlbum; in the picture you can view the view of & kPhotoAlbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these pictures. however, you can't watch these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files out of the folder and copy it again. if you like to avoid annoyed the file, so don't support you to add a larger hard drive to save all pictures you want to save.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to remain a little more privacy, you filter the images that you want to open for others and click on the current view. alternatively, you can also block all images that you may see your little sister, and select the menu entry Everything but above.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way, you have set the images in the case of the Falles to be hidden. if you lock the laptop in the case of your little sister, simply select the menu item. if you want to get blocked, click on lock on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered for unlocking the images. to configure this password, simply select password in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means that you can access the file index.xml. you can read or delete all images on the file index.xml. this type of password protection is only available for those who are familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar to repel the view on private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you're all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at some point. for this reason & kphotoalbum. for this reason & kphotoalbum. this is how you can start a preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. he shows the image, but additional all the information you have on the image, such as who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox appears on the upper part of the image you want to see, so you can also configure that information and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the matching entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and skip down the buttons picture high and picture down. you can get to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run these as Diaschau. & kPhotoAlbum; loads a new picture after a few seconds. as often a new image load can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus the button Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of viewing & photoalbum; is it in full screen mode to change. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can use in the image and zoom out. to enter the image you can get a rectangle. with the Minus button, you can check out the Plus button pomt in the middle of the picture. shows like a zoom-rectangle marked and shows the result of Zooma.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed, so that every pixel sets the zooms, so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations function in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the display functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images, you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. in the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to mark them. but you'll be able to highlight the picture and see more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">A further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer. to see which photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you can view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to watch images with features, while you can view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you press the respective letters. in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these will be available in your browser. so, if you have selected all images you can see, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can use one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in thumbnail view. if you can display categories in DRE preview view, then you can press the characters for the feature by clicking the image after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case you will allow you & kphotoalbum; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painting is not stored in the image, but in the database. you can reverse the batch later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on the painted picture. in order to switch to the painting by & kPhotoAlbum; Please select the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully dominate but the documentation on & Povray; you should have absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and displayed the object in the wire window views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already chosen with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop down menu will end, so you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion from the menu bar on Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can pre-remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you typed invalid values, submit a message with error description and click Apply to Apply or reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; enter user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download them here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you process a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the self-gallery view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-gallery and a small example of the scene is rendered using the selected texture, even if you want to rename a subordinate element, even if you want to rename a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Screen shot shows the camera's control points. you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level. you can specify this value relatively to the level level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the tool selected in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order for default. the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can save them as desired. you can also save multiple window arrangements and easily switch between different directives.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under one view, drag the Anfasser to the upper or bottom of a view. a rectangle appears then the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, pull the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views of one another, drag the Anfasser to another view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map line up in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window rules are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the Anfasser on the desktop or click on the small pointing left arrow at the Anfal bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfal strip. to prevent the lock, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently available. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the icon Rendering The Symbol Rendering in the tool bar or select the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini-files. he determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can select any number of root modes, from a fast preview up to full pictures in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the tool "The Render" in the tool bar or in the menu view, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Any rack mode has a name. you can enter any name at any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card box size you can enter the width and height of the dispenser image. if you want to render only one small area of the image, select the bottom section of the image and enter the image section to the rendering fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop down quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the feature features can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is placed with just a ray of pixels, different mistakes can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or display effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general pictures look better with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, computed and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard, adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because every pixel continues to be split up and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if you set the difference between the measured pixels with super-sampling, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific number of pixels with super sampling, then a grid of 4x4 is charged at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the above threshold, then the pixels are checked individually and further tested on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, when the related rays have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import objects into the scene. to import objects into the scene, simply drag the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle in the camera view and in the window type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the points of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here you can set the Raster separately for shifts, scaling and swivel.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better nails for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed press for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high-detail design for advanced projections, all the camera are using an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better rapprochement for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is thrown behind the objects. the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross ground, a floor below the objects will be rendered. the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the churcheting method, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more information about parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can create your window orders or create new window arrangements. in the section window arrangements, explains how you can create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down window system: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of the window directives shows all existing window orders. create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order. new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window beneath the existing window, with card card, you can't get a card box shared in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just now & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start with accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can set all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but easy scene: a ball on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain about it as a result, you should only use a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultless, take a look at the first launch of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of toolbar. please read the documentation that you can expect a proper idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this is the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the content of object properties, where the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, but note that the camera is in view of control points, with which you can change the camera in view of the camera. simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button or press the button, the wire model views and the slide show instantly change these settings. as a result, you see here the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a squeeader (insert in the body) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; it is actually a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or button. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also indicates the plain, although at the moment only as a limited endable level. if you render the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find out that you can click on the item + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so that you will get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box will be shown in which you can select as the object is inserted. please select the item (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button below you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only shows a matt black material because you can still type settings for the pigment. therefore, remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and ball in the preview, click the user button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, that's not the color. you have to insert two new attributes. in the color list you have to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree of each time, select the colors in the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run, since you have the basic method of work of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the object characteristics, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: in 1 (do not forget to press the button or push the ball contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball-surface looks like a matt black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already in the ground, type a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">First select your object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click Spaces Spaces, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects, if you take time to introduce some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection make up already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: even not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what capabilities to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracts a scene, the rendering of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which reflects the scenes) through each pixel, the visual effects of light sources are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects, such as fog, is processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye to see the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be relieved, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. usually, Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you created before with & kpovmodeler; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu, replacing the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already stored the model, it will be saved under the same name. if there is a new file, you will need a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last saved version. all changes have been dropped since last time.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be chosen if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu entry is only then select if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keys and the default behavior.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove commands to the tool symbols for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a possibility to make rough surfaces, without having to modulate on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then proceed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color to pixel base through applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with amarok and control amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be attached to any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable control of external programs and commands. this is usually the function exec () used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok requires only the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need kdelibs so installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to make kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD are predicting that your window manager will work with the relevant standards of freedesktop.org for example. Gnome will work for example, but Fluxbox will work for example, but we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can check the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amare.kde.org and hang also the broken file that caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and set the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib is crashing to read the meta-info from this file system. please report these errors to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is something more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all compiled by & Amarok; used libraries by the same compiler version. if Z. B. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib was compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crash when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable auto. switch off when inactive for... to the setting of the sound system, or use at least not a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically when a crash). if it is a commonly occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 to the Meta-Infos, but it is not described as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The $argv [0] file does not exist" -f $argv [0]; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $argv [0]\" $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colliating Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf that Amarok is the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most installer issues are clarified by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also use help with other users or for developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net at the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the Start window was converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols changed with Amaro1.4 Fast Forward: stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate each piece, in the playlist, the evaluation bar must be displayed. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review on a piece. you can also use the Shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses one of the backend independent approach, therefore the actual question is which media types supports Gaul / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support so rather every single audio format.

<seg id="1272">If you use the Gse-Sink, the device must provide a blender. a blender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously through a sound card using the hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the cause of cause and cause a solution. for GStreamer you might need to specify another Sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. do not forget that media must be decoded first. if you are looking for a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice if you read a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can spend right at ALSA, exactly as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts & multimedia sound system. enable the sound server with highest priority (real time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-Multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffers in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less sluggish react the visualizations. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarods; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer you must register all components. lead GST-register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask for the IRC -channel # gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarofile before!): - Store you to compile, compile and install it. then go to GST-register all ffmpeg files (you will find the module folder with GST-config / gaspamer-config) and run GST-register again. now start & Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1334">In this chapter, explains how all the functions of & Amarods are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amaro.Control Centre. in the upper edge of the window there is a running display indicating the current current piece or the current stream. directly below is the area, the season, bitrate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the current play of the play.</seg>

<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP; you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the function catcher, so it is rather your taste and the type of your assignment vital to which the accompanying program will give you a suit.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to make sure that & k3b; start to make sure that & k3b; start a bit like the following on the console:</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (k3b, K3bProject-0), and then a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject. using this reference, it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT and $(dcop k3b K3bp k3b createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT CreateFolder dcop $PROJECT addurn / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / regular file.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per titles) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioei; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders are already present, so it is highly likely to compile something yourself. however, only the encoders may be installed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation will not be required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format should be used? the chapter Which Kodierer gives a small introduction about codierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying the protected audio CD; as already said, uses & kaudio.cdparanoia to read out the audio data. if not the firmware version of the & CD; it is not possible to read a protected audio CD; even if not the mechanism of copy protection is possible. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only one needs to be made (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending which codes are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDB from the Internet, or can be fully covered without network, with everything manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a quick list of commands of the main track. on the side step by step, you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab card configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start CDDB request of CD data according to the installation of inquiry in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts out and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Kodization Settings tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">If a sub-menu opens with a list of available Encoder, so the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default value. it is too noted that the encoder settings in the tab settings dialog was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file to code will be selected instead of a full & CD; read and add.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; ends).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioya; with different card cards (such as encoder, to setup the Encoders). you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coaster and compression rates, and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, lose the information by data compression, depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important as both codiers produce excellent audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will be included with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high quality sound quality (high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playing devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - initially, these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a Title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a Title. well enough for music by youths, portable devices and autostereosmoss. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that entered manually or from the FreeDB program via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be handed / needed to create the file names and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters. the manual or help to the codiers explain the switch to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiorem; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioks; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB is: a free database, in which persons can read / enter the information you can download, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the author of the Uebere) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; and besides, the information can be hurt on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither can neither the artist nor the music business. all information can be hurt anyway with a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioya; is active to select a check box (sending a address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when calling the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiov; used to use FreeDB will be used to use geographically on the next level mirror. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only updates the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that cdparanoia is used to know it in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read-up WAV files, the codiers and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first time, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab to set the Kodierers. other encoders can be added to this tab yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the coerer can be used before the codierer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codiers. more information about Kodierer can be found in Chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codiers, you can get further information about his switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console) must be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device's name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reader of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the design of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program precisely what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your PC. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. in any case it is not necessary to compile it as a completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have screams on it (eg; by copying it with the conqueror something in).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudioeives; something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for every read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we identify the codierer for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) and which structure is used to use the FreeDB file to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with every reading of a & CD; change once the right settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number is delivered to the reading program so that it can read / write data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive, it can also be used with the file / etc / fl and an attempt with the existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card map material settings. here you can't do much. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown as input / typed as shown in screen picture.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only when impartial information is available, so that you will be informed when information to create keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card box CD; Settings. just select both entries. we are convenient and letting the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD, so that he can access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, begins immediately the reading of the & CD; this is easily changed using the database entry and the file name change. the directory names or filename will be easily changed using Conqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter the selection fields and FreeDB will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB, if you have to use the database before. however, the two selections must be selected twice, at least the first one. mode is set up on the following card box.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. put it all as shown in screen picture.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look at it after a mirror server near you. on this path, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, because many firewalls are working 8880 by default, but there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit data to the FreeDB server. the first check box should be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just assume your screen's settings. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously lashing pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know, so simply try myself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored. if the box is not checked, the files will not be checked, if you want to make this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All to enter as it is on screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances a bit to the right has to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo equipment. the resulting bitrate is on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the production of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. in case of later modifications of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen shot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files at the same time: using a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can add more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiov; terminate. this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; it is described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDB will be picked up. the process of data is described in this section, must be repeated for any expansion & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; which is not yet included in FreeDB, the screen shots are slightly different from the data available for a & CD; so you will learn the & CD; you will learn to collect data manually instead of taking them out of the internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example s can be found. it's a 'special' edition of this author's book.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, so now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window so as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified, and can be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then check the questions and answers within the help or go back to the previous section on basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully by FreeDB, all songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually redeem this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not get any local database, you will need the Internet access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into a 'Update' box, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidics per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments playing together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from FreeDB is not empty, it's always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words are with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields for the comment, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have an unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiorem; max. this option is set up on the Kodierersettings tab; throw a look in the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see the help of the codierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, obviously with the style of the output release. in this example, this is not important because we will not transfer the & CD; for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears and you will see that the fields are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and album will be displayed above the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the title will be selected. just make sure that all pieces are selected, or refine your button to select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button select the reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab card to turn off on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read straight on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left side of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a codierer, which you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been encoded with a red'X 'in the list list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code in parallel. note the status item in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour, the number of parallel processes to read and code. at high-level machines, the result is unclear. the use of the computer with a amd64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous failure and code (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will display with a message for a short time in the top left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioya;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codierer of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudioya; today you can entertain a pre-compiled package within the & kde; if you're familiar with CVS, you can already install a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiov; a part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons created by source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program will be adapted to your needs if it runs once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different other programs, has many variants of settings. at best you read the step for example to learn the options and settings. it shows screen shots of different card maps and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, it is enabled to open the temporary collection when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click Removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played off. if you select The series after the submenu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be reset.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list on the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump up a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the button predefined piece, the entry predicted piece from the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events translates into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in the events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all Soundcards GM are compatible (including AWE - and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary changes for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. for this, however, that every occurrence is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Fine PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note, that the left side of the equilibrium is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 "s.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that supports this instrument (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a tissue. to do so, you can attach the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (tissue shooting), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of patch is meant to represent a different percussioning instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;), and not the one that sound the sound height of the same drum (like him some keyboards do).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how notes are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to create notes on the percussions channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to transfer some channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you are using the Keymap option, the keymap must not be defined in front in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the peruses channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch BenderRatio can be multiplied in which relation Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI-file is disputed with the value, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used, so that the map file doesn't stand decimal (s).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is giving a keyboard that will play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards up to play two notes to a octave is to play the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit by & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this in menu on Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole range of pioons (one for each MIDI channel). on this piano, see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument, no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canal view (until now) has two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file may lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone else to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary (rpm, deb) by & kmid; it has happened because & kmid; without AWE support, you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed to support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder that you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can push the arrow keys left from the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & Conqueror; -Desktop a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this screen, if I want to play a Karaoke file or play a file, simply switch to the & Konqueror; window, and move the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this an MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">And then join the B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! if I hear these songs or the postcard, this will be animated on me & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to submit the preferred links under the menu bookmarks, but these are single entries. if you wish to create a list of entries, you should use the category Durable playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you copy an entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlists can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this by using a editor, but also by using the application itself. simply click on a name of a category. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select from the menu, select either the playlist, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. here is an example of how a flash-mozilla module is played using the swfdec mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, it should also work (presumably this kind of playing video devices under Linux too). this is why the videoforlinux extension has to be functional for the X server. therefore, it is necessary to include the XFree86 server in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; encourage the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the best and submising element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When you view the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective view.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; -file [straightforward file size (engl. D e V ice I nimFile)] has been created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the respective line in & latex; source code.</seg>

<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed designation (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. for the editing of & BibTex; files are necessary only if the file is necessary for a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & BibTex; -Files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name of the field is used for the establishment of the font. it can be specified for the main text, the fox notes, etc., there are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & ile, two choices are available: 1. the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and basis of settings. 2. the document can be written by reason to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class will contain the settings for the command. the settings [12pt] specifies the font's font. if the font is not set at the beginning, the text can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code is entered, the & latex file has to be compiled. the simplest way for this is the use of the menu or the button Quick structure.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compile. & ile; save the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, the log should be sought after errors. when using quick assembly & eyepiece; this is not the case, the log should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text which is different from the remaining document. for example, a report with the written document should have been created. the command\\ 'start {environment},\\ Huge and\\' environment} can be encouraged to give the lettering of the written form within the surroundings.

<seg id="1781">The given changes are appalled only within the environment (from\\ 'environment} to\\' environment}. there is no coating (number) for the given changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to welcome the reading and user-friendliness of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, fat pressure, italic pressure, substringings, etc., these commands are either end using the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'start {recommended}: this command is available for the italic pressure, until it is closed with a\\' emph} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be displayed using\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\ as {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; recording language is presented, follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the wizard has been typed a bit of text, a few adjustments to the better readability of the document should be completed. a quote, a few places in fat and italics and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantilus; used to provide support for markup- and scripting languages; their simplicity and flexibility are made of & quanta; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are in two types, family 1, the markup language and family 2, the script language or & CSS; and TagXML files are comprised of two parts, the tag folder and the tool. tag folders (above the editing window), insert text and instructions faster into a document, as a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on transformation.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bars. short, a & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresdialoges, which shows & quanta; for the day shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; the tool contains a quick paste in a document without risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the read-language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML, and declared it is necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries are displayed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only one element type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; a argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class type. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. specifies the name of the class where this method is. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has been a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. that is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. additionally it contains the name and the type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that shall be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for the attributes in tag Editordialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quanta, is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name within & quanta, is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and methodology name. the arguments given to the method. can be empty or% tagame%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that grouped the elements of a list. it can occur only once. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of attribute text in a dialog box. this tag can only occur in one dialog only once (for example for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present in the dialog box (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the Tags. this element is an only-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end one day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files have to start with a & XML; - Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be locked and closed properly.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools dialog in the top & quantilus; -window to start and check out TagXMLA. another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not currently available. currently, check is only performed when charging the TagXML files in & quanta.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, a functioning family 2 TagxXML file. in this file a & PHP is described; overloading function is described. the file name of this TagXML file will be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DTD. thus diedescriptionrc; for a list of selectable & DTEP; for a new created & DTEP; for a new created & DTEP; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quad; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions with settings... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button assigned to this action. with clicking the user defined can be assigned a shortcut; with Kone the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings, and in execution of the action this text will be inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it's not limited) to change the document or as input (or parts of document), i.e. examples taken from & quanta; even are the quick start-dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, it is recommended to find the script in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH (there are other special variable, which can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file it is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: when used by the PID of the current & quantilus; only one instance runs; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantilus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods mentioned above, a script input from & quantilus; at default input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the document's selected area is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the introduced application can be reversed. there are two types of output: normal edition, on the standard output; error messages can be specified on the standard output. it can be specified by the default output that is set to be adjusted:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in the case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. choose Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the day to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the day has attributes and you are planning to use, enable the tag "tag" if available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select the size of others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note, that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will mostly be interpreted as a symbol), or should at least, a message to the user be signalized, click on this symbol a & lt; starting the day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantilus;) and selection of desired promotion. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it is, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantilus; functions for tool bar, or it should be shared to the better overview of some separators in multiple groups. make sure that the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I'd like to select the Trenner (top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the tool bar, press the arrow keys to the right. this adds the tool to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to preview an easy way to access the Conqueror preview. I'll select it and add to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner does not support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Konqueror; -button the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by adding all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the proper folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the proper folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar is loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen extension of & quantilus; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language, which is like I like a & PHP; -documentation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check the & quad; -Repository check if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. first, let's let you handle the second part we treat it here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relatively to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top item = Section 1.html Section 2 = 2.1.html Section 2 = 2.1.html-2 = GMT 2.html day 2 = tag2.html day 3 = tag2 html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation area. for example, see the & PHP documentation; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html getting started, # Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to getting started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You can notice that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folders displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; Resourcendatts will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the area of the docrc file which is used to display the context of context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; -script file would display the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and save after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / quantum / apps for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and it's worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. the documentation used to be used by the quantilus; - community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked at the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantilus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the remaining resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places, we send an email menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantum lus; users can be downloaded and used only if our team needs them to sign a useful contribution, wherewith it requires a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources will ensure our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you will be asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can enter one out. in the dialog New Resource (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking on OK the uploading will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also upload from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool bar, and files in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems warns and it can be canceled. if integrity has been given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the specifying of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet created by & quanta; it is possible to work by using a DTEP package because hundreds of tag files may be needed in everyday XML format. there are the easier way to automatically convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from DTD's DTD, and Converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / qua / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that should appear in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, produces & quad; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantilus; there are some key concepts. to understand these concepts and make full benefit from & quanta; this chapter tries to bring them to these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantitative. little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantilus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a range of components in & quantilus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone, the & quanta lus; uses, available. of toolbars about actions, everything is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quanta; saved. this enables the group to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all done by & CSS; - patterns up to toolbars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The quantilus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the builders, the cartridges with info and the tool products. please strike in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the box with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current Documet matching entries, such as close the current, other or all map devices, reload, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal click in the editor section lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the file under the mouse pointer or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse hand.</seg>
<seg id="2089">On the upper end of the editor, the tool bar of the editor is located. currently, & quantilus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as a standard for which a proposition of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of products, the tool bars are adapted to the new features and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; if they want to insert the tag, then click on the tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog of different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information to & quantilus; to navigate, to open and to pass through. in the presentation with cartridges are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation constructions.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quanta. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using the right click. actions such as adding, removal, uploading or delete the files from storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantilus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: images, program parts, all web pages & etc; It is open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in global, local and project also works here. by clicking the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit, or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of an element it is set to the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element it opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other builders. with it manfast attributes and namespaces change. this enables the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. it can download pre-packed documentation for & quad; from the quantum lus; 'documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quanta; two cartridges at the bottom of the window, where useful information can be reached: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map shows information about each in quantum running script. for example, the currently used DTD uses the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map shows all mistakes in the markup of the current document. & quanta; scripts that are carried out, give all error messages (so it gives) to this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">& quanta lus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantilus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitative lus; is the ability to send a tool bar with mail. & quantilus; if they get a tool bar in an email, they can buy them in & quantilus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of & quad; for this, autoconf gives you a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantilus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. you should also make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is in front of their bin's folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative lus; is a web development tool designed for the KDE surface. & quantilus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, developers began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quanta lus; an independent, expandable Markup language editor. well, this would make him the most treasured web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; therefore it should be a suitable & IDE; for that it should be suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned claim must be kept that & quantilus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & knot; thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quanta lus; as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quanta lus; enables Web developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost any task. through the program Commisystems, they can capture & quantify. (more about it you will find in.)</seg>

<seg id="2185">In & quanta lus, many highland profiles can be created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing, or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name to copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally this doesn't need to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacker wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it after your discretion. the password will be saved on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but everyone can easily see in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple diving of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the newly opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu or the Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings tool toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantilus; with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting & quantilus; to their own workings.</seg>

<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which the tool bar can be created, tool bar or toolbar, which can be specified in the dialog, where the actions may be displayed on this or other tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries to remove and action are shown that are self explanatory.</seg>

<seg id="2197">Templates are mainly available in the key documentation, code Schnitzel and files for connecting. & quanta; you can copy, move or any existing directory in the prelagenbaum. templates have been in & quanta. in about the restrictions you submit to the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative templates; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set before using any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binaries. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in pre-storage space under global templates. further information about templates baum is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. on basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in an appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples may be found in the pre-storage room under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful, if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are listed in the prelagenbaum below global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are serving all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder set, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples of & quantilus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to you (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As a template. save your local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click the file as a template, save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and insertion on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file will only copy in a template folder. you can use all file management functions, such as pulling and drop or insertion about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a file in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder, and secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projectors enable a very target-oriented advance. you can insert header lines and footer. you can insert files or link them with them. in addition, some things can be kept deep in the eye when using templates.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The basic structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files used in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / template / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this option is blinded when the attributes shown are vered.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default for everything except for a regular folder. if a regular folder would be set, it would be explicitly activated in this path, except they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text size. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a trunk folders.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a previous or found text for templates in this folder. this could be general head-lines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip copy of content templates into a folder with special header lines / footer a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folder or copy and paste from templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quanta lus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -site and a cursor appears. then you can edit and edit the source code editor when needed in the VPL; -Editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">In working with the VPL; editor on a document called & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the vohandals of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -editor. it is not necessary to edit this directly with the VPL; there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor in the source code editor and in the VPL; -Editor is already active, this mode is already active, if the key tenant is kept from one window to another, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -View may be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast calculator and a large spanne for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, the documentation of invisible tags in the work with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor that is used to change the suspension Kodierens. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags leaves the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. slogans for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added down by pushing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows changing the contents, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to create or delete CSS rules in the browser. you can add CSS rules using buttons below the list or delete a change over the list. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as in a text processing, possible due to due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted into the type and can be deleted by button or remodeling.</seg>
<seg id="2225">In the same way, inserting tags will be carried out in the same way via the toolbar editor, as in the source text editor, if an anchor tag is not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted into the text, each other input tag needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables-assistant or the Listen-Assistant are disabled. they will be used later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had changed many changes, and at the same time had corrected a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was showing me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly was changed within this lines. and there was no clues to the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed. merge changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of additional useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare quick text, just copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently from each other to a piece of body and make changes. in this editor you can even edit the results. in this editor, you can even edit the results directly. this screen shows three source files with merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the same and merging merging folders. this screen picture shows & kdiff3; at the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences between the options of today's color monitors. if you have to check co-check, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the column on the left side. (no trouble anymore when somebody changes the recovery.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by using only the file name in the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folner2 Folner2 Folner2 Folner2 folder Folder 2 Folner2 Folner2 Folner2 Folner3 Folner3 Folner3 Folner3 Folner3 Folner2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows to manually update the file type (file...) or selecting a last open file from the drop-up file. you do not need to specify a third file in the next time; if you have to leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button file... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, select the same or merging of folders. if you select a file, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field will process for the goal, and it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output file immediately. you can take this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and shut down: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you would like to find out how similar these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, load it in & kdiff3; download and then compare it. now you can copy, paste and then compare these functions.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can draw nothing out of & kdiff3; only drag by text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part each text box is the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the path is too long). (if the path is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color, which file is different. if both files distinguish, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links to the text is the gathering column. if differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. with some programming languages, the color will not be so important to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the merge column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison plugs) also has an information line with the wording:, the file name and [it changes] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, saving is disabled!!! (use buttons to the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference must also be solved at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group's first line will be shown in all windows, and the first line of the group is displayed. (this group will then be highlighted in the beginning of the group.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic merge or by manual editing no further line remains in the group; then this is only a wildcard for the case that you can change your mind and perhaps then select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and merge differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy this text from the outcome window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources you choose to ignore or ignore C / C + + comment, changes in numbers or comments will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate up mainly with the picture-up and the mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys to the left, right, down, side down, side down, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs, just click here to navigate directly to the navigation bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between plug and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already mentioned in the section merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture) or the next / previous conflict too. therefore, it must be distinguished between dissolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is activated automatically, you will be automatically copied to the clipboard. be careful with this option, but you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-end switches are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in feed\, and Win32-based systems use a line-in mechanism\\ r\. diff3 retains the line-end of the source file, so you should use & kdiff3; not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when the next start. (set up menu &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a writing with solid width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be rendered astringed. on these systems, the button preferences automatically displays an unregulated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the tab button is inserted, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the insertion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, every selection will be copied automatically into clipboard. manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which tick-type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When trying to find files & kdiff3; first to find all identical lines in the source file. only during this first step, white characters may be ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a venture kick-in '\'\ 'and a line slot'\ 'at the end of one line, other again save only one line of line'\ '. if this option is activated, wagering marks are visible, but as a white character must be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled. in default, this is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences will be displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for smaller differences. the option is activated in default, but it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-step mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is going to jump.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you want to use it only from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + 2 comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter for scanning of folders and executing a merge. check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version is the suffix .original file. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original file, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and restart the change. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is posted globally over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, all entries are used for top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for encoding a short notice, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this is how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preliminary commands, they may not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to subpress review of changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + 2 comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. according to selection from A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal even a second excess column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply send the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window with each other or superimposed each other. this option can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide then to merge the files together. a simple click starts to compare the merge file and use the file name as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example to cut disrupting parts or to correct the adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used only when command line command. the output of the command is only used when typing your own processor. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to allow more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program requires that, and most users would not want to program the good news. however, the good news is that in most cases are sed or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line input to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\ '/\\'. *\\ '/\\'. *\\ '.' *\\ 'refers to the found text in the first clamp. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems are used to include a number of key words automatically created by using the same pattern: SED's /\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example for an additional processing warrant for line abduced. / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hits, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi it is deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may need to perform multiple considerations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the results from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different like perl. perl -p -e's / switch 'However, perl needs some details. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and tracking. other operations only change the data that can see the line-like algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and combine complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without them really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not to merge together. to merge together, select the corresponding menu entry, or press the F7 key. (more details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you informs a small message frame about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, displays & kdiff3; a list window with results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the button or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions to open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the plug-in action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge starts, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if your overall content is identical. then the folder also has the same color. for folder the age is irrelevant to its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colours of a sheet again, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory file types exist. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B cannot have the same file type (e.g. if a a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory file types exist. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to synchronize, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B; directly after merge and kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then check the error message. if the files are different, then an error message appears. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. solder can't be removed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file will work after the other. you status column shows Fertig on when the merging was successful, and in accordance with other messages, if something unexpected is complete, you should make a final check and check whether the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When selecting the file method Full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the just selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all entries (also in all submissions), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C will be used as target using the two-folder merge and synchronize B and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check if any entries must be displayed in the folder file, too. there are some options to be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select File Commit / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the button closure). to complete only the current entry, select the action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting data types exist still invalid merge actions, a message appears on the defective items. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options added, stimulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then carry out certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is needed (assembled a single file), then a merge window opens (see screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select File Encryption again, or press F7. if you have not saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you attempt to skip the cause of the problem or skip the problematic entry, or solve the problem in any other way, before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were assembled individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and results in later, they will not be logged in. even if the merge changes, these entries are regarded as accomplished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. can be used more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. can be used more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem, files have an attribute. in other filesystem, a precursor is selected. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links to folders: if the option is switched off, the links are treated as normal folder. if the option is switched ON, you will check the links such as normal folder. a link to a folder that will lead to itself and switch on a link.) This option is switched off at default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Results in full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, un- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they are applied to files containing no text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders about a slow network, it may be faster, only to compare the change date and the file size. please use a certain degree of safety. please use caution. this option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to trust date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equally big. for example, if copying the change date is lost, please use caution. this option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the proposals will be selected to merge so that both folders are stored in both folders. this option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of mering the newer file as an action, the knowledge is provided that the other file is not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or delete a folder, then the original version is renamed. if an old backup file exists with the .original extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this option also affects the complete folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge list remains visible to merging individual files; if you don't want, you can turn the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, turn the main window in the window menu and switch it through between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file via double-click. yet, in the directory menu, you can also launch a single file. as soon as you store the folder, the status will be reset to Erlef and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: re-read the directory:</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone or.., which is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special signs must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP, SFTP:)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date from the original. (note the default of the size of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference-viewer in KDevotiv. KDevis always starts to launch the built-in differences. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart 1, & kdiff3; that the input file is a patch file in the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu in - KDiff3Part. please note that it doesn't work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The name KDiff3 is already available with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's Compare) already. in addition, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can result as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to see in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go it so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not have the right prefix to KDE. in default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if the lines, next to each other, this is cois comisattribute this is completely the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor refers to any difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file, and it is too much effort to create extra file format, which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly missing; no src linked; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes you can find under http: / / or diff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>

<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replace the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Just display differences: files that are identical in all files do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to review the folder when updating this folder.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There will only be entries to exhibit the differences. in case the target folder will not already be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already available), clicking the button will be removed accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. undertakings in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual work areas. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the workspace to stop them or move it. this works both inside a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications running applications. applications can be selected and even be moved to desktop and other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on what the right mouse button is clicked on, if on the empty background of & kpager; clicked on, the context menu will only set up the two entries Pager. if it is clicked on a application within & kpager; if it is clicked on a application inside & kpager; click on the command and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, At desktop and end. these commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of your desktop. appears only when it is clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only when it is clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this box is checked, windows can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager; the names of virtual workspaces is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field leaves the & kpager; show the numbers of virtual workspace. it is displayed along with name, the names with ordinates are provided, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & kpager; displayed only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol indicates a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here you can define the order of the & kpager; classic leaves & kpager; like from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation on the side.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their content and move. besides, it runs outside the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and select selecting the switch... lets the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. If you don't need to register root files or contact your system administrator. in this file you have to assign the key to windowtransparentmode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can catch the contents of the magnifier and move. this also goes with arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are in addition to the & Shift; push button or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain when clicking the mouse, causing so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can also have pain associated with the use because of your computer, if you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clear it once: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid having caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the reference because of the mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic auxiliary agents, the result can fall for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is enabled, makes & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. move it up to the end of movement, before the release of the mouse button carry out. in this way, you can make the pulling at an impressive mouse button. in this way, you can pull the pulling out a bit exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This variation must be stuttered after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound appears, you can drag & kde; to make the response time to shorten. go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the rider General. there's a shift sound buffer, you can adjust to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at any startup of & kde; it is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window conditions, please find out the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first of all with preferences. in particular, the smart shifts should be turned off first. if you then have used to the automatic mouse click here, you can later increase the smart shifts.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it might need to decrease the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or at locations in the browser window, which does not display any link, will not park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is jerky, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quick to see if you watch the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape easily with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks the design of & kmousetool; if you have just begun a shifts in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and postpone window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can use yourself a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it. but you can't park the mouse on a neutral area of your desktop, if you are unable to cause a button of mouse clicks. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the tool bars and the title lines of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shifts, if you just start to use & kmousetool to use. instead, check the button next to the text area and hold the Shift key instead, while you move the mouse into the other end of the text and push the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this makes every time you play a sound like a mouse click. so, you know exactly when when smart shifts take the move. later, you can use the smart shifts also without the audible mouseclick. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you must have the XTest Extension for & X windows; it should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and this correctly set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, draw the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages too. see also on the website of ktts; for information that are not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses a customizable module architecture for language support. if you want & ktops; for use with another synthesizers, you will contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for support SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops; you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you purchase the source code from & ktts; available from the source file repository for kdeaccessibility or download the tarball in every night, recompile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & ktops; check first if speech-dispatcher is working properly with your language skills. to do so, you can use the script script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; the program kttmsgr is to be developed so further that the set of speech dispatcher is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is dismantled into single sentences. the user can go back, repeat the output or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If you have an application text on & ktops; for example, if you have set up the preferred microphone for the issue. if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will automatically be the best suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktops; you will find a spokesman for you.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the card box (click) to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card box will be displayed. as an example, the card box will be shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to the modules.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path is included at the Festival in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival. in case of voices, the & ktops are known, this setting will automatically be made. generally speaking, western languages such as Czech or Slovak, ISO 8859-2 can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some knob and displayed this gray, the settings will not be selected by you.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you load this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD, so (with greater memory consumption) the first rate will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have no speaker yet (or forgot to click user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this box is checked, at the start of kttsmgr the program window is displayed. otherwise, the program window is visible only in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the section section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and kttsmgr is not running, it appears in the system section as soon as KTTSD is reading a text. thus, you have the opportunity to read or manage it otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all assignments listed in the queue, together with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the straight processed proposition. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With buttons in this series you can set a full purpose in the order, which is selected in the list below, pre- or back. (but not every job consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, any changes in the settings (also on the other cards) are taken over and kttsmgr is reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If Gaul or aCode is to be used for the audio output, select the audio output. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must select at least one module. if you have chosen ALSA, select the PCM device. see also</seg>
<seg id="2700">Place the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200nbsp;% approximately double normal speed speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program sox must be installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to apply the new settings for the current & ktops; -System.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you have to find out what device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map card, you can set up special actions, which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktops; processes four types of speech orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen reusers has the highest priority. it will preceded all other orders and holds up these orders. after the edition of the screen reader has been read, the received orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next room priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning will hold the issue of messages and regular text. these orders will continue after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts ordinary text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just send a long text on a website, you can greet with & kmouth; yet somebody welcome you who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the issue of a screen readers, add & ktops; the audio output is queue in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"" "this audio file will always be played, if a normal text order is interrupted by the introductory sound as well as introductory message, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message." ""</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text entries. for messages, warnings and expenses of screen remembers, there are no particular actions when they are interrupted by a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read by & ktops; please proceed to Nottsmgr and click Notifications. the map card notifications appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Mark this check box to switch the reading of & kde; if this setting is not checked, the other settings are disabled and & ktops; reads no messaging.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications for which a sound is played, by & ktops; not read.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice output, the speaker, the voice, the voice, the voice and pitch. additionally, brands for controlling the pronunciation. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival is using SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuated energefier (SDB filter). thus, the first proposition must begin, as only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also jump or cancel and cancel, even if the language is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-by-marginalization filter. at the first start of & ktops; you can change its settings or add other audio-marginalization filters, however it will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the simplest study, you can learn the device selection and give you text to read. check the speaker button again, change some features and check out how the speaker's selection has changed. for this, you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster with the pre-read can begin, as only the first set must be processed, and not the whole text block which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then stop writing files on the map card orders, even if the language support does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal set-rate monitor is automatically set up if you start a ktmgr for the first time. don't be shut off, only removed. don't change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzcross-characteristic filters compare text with a regular expression of propositional and append a tabulator mark (decimal code 8) to the punctuation (tabular characters are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard set-by-rate monitor is the drawing of character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied on & kde; messages (cold), warnings, news, or the output of screen reaers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from the normal Satrate polyurement filter, you can insert this back by clicking the in & ktops; included the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">In the card box, you can write the menu settings for the application. the card box will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words, no speaking properties will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable microphone, which has all properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit, choose & ktops. otherwise select & ktops; but the speaker, the most originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speech properties, by clicking on one of the selection knobs.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this property doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority before other features. you can also place several markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is treated, this will always be used as a priority. the only case where you might know the attribute language is available, if you know that a particular application text is sent to another language than that in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area, the most common one is to delete, click on the selection button and then use on actors that meets the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number, the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it starts. I compiled debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer's crashed and & ktops were finished. probably you have to register GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, it may be a not compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output above ALSA doesn't work if I play music at the same time. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktops; a message on the & console; appears a message that says: "to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts with ALSA will perform that the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. references for potential solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-fint.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have loaded an additional voice for Festival from the Internet. I installed it and can't use them in Festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices the new voice. as a guide, please send the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch with the & URL, where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card audio, there is a setting speed. so that works, you must be able to install the program sox and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizers such as Festival Interactive can offer itself on the map card for speaking at speed. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or if you are completely brave, change the .xsl-file of the & HTML; -according to-SSML-converting filter, and put the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it read that web pages will be read with a female voice. I created a female Festival speaker, but & ktops; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1,95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. thus, the XSL file deletes files to convert SSML to Saber the GENDER-tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I've been added to your own animation filter and now I can go into & ktops; do not get back any more satin or back. on the map of the card, the order is only taken out of a set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, ruby signs, comma and semicolon) you must not filter out. use for these signs instead a filter for the proposition recognition.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture) ALSA is available on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-sht.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the GST-register before using the GST-register. (HTTP: / / gstreus.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts with audio output. if your system counts too, you can't play music at the same time and start reading a text when you start a text order and then start a further. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aCode supports not any real breaks. if you have a text order in & ktops, the current set will still be read yet.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter is shown; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a controlcenter; Internet & Network network settings in the & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical equipment and their drivers must already be operational and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device can display at all and allows setting the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers will need to be loaded by adjusting the following files corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded if the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. in the start of the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the platform is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and releasing the relevance. by marking the settings non-again-ask, the definition will be defined permanently. at the next startup of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. before, all options are grey shown, the settings can only be viewed, the settings are not possible. in the system management mode, you can click on the lower right end of the module. it is required to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. this is divided into three riders:</seg>

<seg id="2810">By default, only the basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button to extend the dialog with other options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from an DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address will be required at any system start, so no further setting is required. in the list box, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually, without DHCP or BOOTP can be configured using TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address the desired TCP / IP address must specify the subnetmask.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The website of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkmach.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphic user like kpackage or the installation tool of your distro.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the Qt and & B installation will suffice; but additionally, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network machines are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area may not replace other knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC are mediated in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) and IPv5 has never found large distribution. therefore, IPv6 is expected to pass through in the near future. therefore, this description is focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which addresses the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the network administrator to activate a valid IP address; if available, the IP address can't be used easily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded during the Internet, so its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0 so that all calculators are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP redirection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files you are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL connections, so it will be surprised if there is no other content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is discarded by the scripting in SuSEconfig. another state as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; put the tape back and reads the exciting information on the tape. recognizes & kdat; the prejudices on the tape, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by the failure of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change in symbol for the band, that the bond for the band was solved and displays a message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without a danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; used to be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>

<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacitor, & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost, the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you must select the file to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rebuild the index to two types from tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This allows a viewing profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a viewing profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, where the fuse is to be done. the list of the secured files will be automatically updated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under the backup files, that only the files are stored in the file system, such as the folder. folders that can be found on other file systems, can be viewed separately from tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>

<seg id="2926">The file's name, which is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>

<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path needs to refer to the non-retic variant of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command will be inhibited to the drive. at some drives this is necessary to be done before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & kdat; it tries to lock up with the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work at all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the release of the integration of & kdat; automatically disconnect the band. do not use this option with Floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the blocksize of your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of tape. this file should only prove a storage block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string account is machine name: seconds, where the name is the whole name of the system, on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar can manage. even other tar versions should work while it does not work around incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kite; -viewer for system protocols. the program is intended for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system can get the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps to understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified display of the protocol files of your own system. the program is for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some extended functions, with which the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen picture, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log; it will not appear instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; it is usually not possible with Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not usually have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or to the selected string. the list of log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter screen. in default, a protocol line will only appear if shown in one of the columns, the filter string is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this point. if the string of filter search results will then be selected only with entries in the column file system, and then carry out in the filter line the name of a process, so you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you recognize the most important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error will be displayed using a showy color as a log note. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display certain process (for example in the system log or in the cron protocol), so you can download the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you would like to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to show all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu to open up additional subwindows. as soon as you select a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further current information about the source squats of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kite; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system develops quickly to the standard for checking the system start-up in the & Linux. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine to System V Init, without reinstalling a new installation and re-format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort, rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole bunch of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you would like to start running on another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should also lie down under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you want to use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to perform a bit more using the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different positions after the program init and starts the first one which he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column, and you probably realize that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you have to change it, then you can fix / etc / inert by hand and then fix it by using the system if you restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do I get all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no proper files are located. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? very simple: any of the scripts is written so that it is a argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd servers. init reads the name, and when it includes a K, the script will be called Stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server -runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; also, I could also have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc;</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not trivial, simply drag an entry from the field of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts either from Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they draw out an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you simply drag this into a new range. to copy them from the menu Edit or select from the context menu, and then select in the target area - even if the same entry has previously existed in the action area.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown in the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the various working areas (availability, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserts (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the button button to change the Properties dialog. connect the button to accept the Properties button, to accept the changes in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. by default, the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) will be removed. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the preferences will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've been experimented with the standard Runlevles, and now the machine restarts. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and modify the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, like system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary software programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if any configuration files are required (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are just ending without any message when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
