although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , American authors and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts , who were the Supreme Court of Justice , who were inc@@ lined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very shy letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he moves with his skin .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that has ever been nominated by the Party nominated by the Party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans , who support these big@@ ots , I asked myself ?
I could not put Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , as my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journal &apos;s journ@@ alism , people from all over the world takes a deep gl@@ itter@@ y person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
Tr@@ ump Int@@ oler@@ ance is also the contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for life long and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much with my career .
these people and those of them em@@ body values deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump b@@ ah@@ elled his way to the appointed rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the idea of the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as a r@@ attle .
re@@ arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led to us this situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those that act and think in a different way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that those voters are , of whom the majority are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ end@@ eth the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like contemp@@ t for those who look differently than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lighten@@ ing the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; word game of white in raising to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash ( which is as much as Sch@@ ing@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has just killed what America was so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have , America is welcome every welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose his president twice the son of a Ken@@ nel , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom , and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rest , they say .
in all this , I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word@@ shift with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , it wasn &apos;t your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no more place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart to me .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love of music through rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among the tourists - but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a few years now La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults , existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments a way to overcome the surrounding poverty .
a school school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs .
yet this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ el@@ ih@@ ood .
young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their big passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you meet day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , with instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have begun under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez to transform parts of the case in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double bass player , guitars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trombone and percussion which were all produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , re@@ members the first time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them were not living together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a viol@@ inist made of waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and this is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ ers ) records the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the wor@@ m@@ est ones - like men in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that com@@ bats wild illegal fishing .
this post written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has been speaking about international , pract@@ ised solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publishing occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for mutual use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ i@@ ian waters of illegal fishing before it was searching for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries had been upset so far and slightly inc@@ lined to welcome a bill of legislation on its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members a senior member of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . it is part of a team who discovered the ship time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish .
ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( stopping fishing ) was founded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar , which had then displac@@ ed the premi@@ ums from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are sp@@ inn@@ ed together and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it goes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers support for F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition , which is conce@@ aled , is conce@@ aled because of it is extremely difficult to rise up . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate mis@@ ing of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem may harm a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and with the information between individual countries , these actions happen nowadays in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
the individual countries , for example , can exchange or experience lists of existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activity or details , which were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es ships of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark ships that fish in banned areas . also , such suspic@@ ious lanes can detect - such as that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the ships involved a fish catch , where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to the assum@@ ption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is about significant financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the platform already mentioned was created to gain a total of 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen who enter Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms , especially attrac@@ ting the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
these actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specif@@ ying fant@@ asi@@ an seeds , fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use specifically the lack of international cooperation and control the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ seam@@ less control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could be illegal and a country could say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks , which distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has been pursued and found vol@@ at@@ ile ships .
due to his cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority on com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system , which aims to help F@@ ISH , suspic@@ ious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , also helps to pick up the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , who also deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch on for example their automatic identification systems , with which they cannot be operated by satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system which connects various information carriers . it should help F@@ ISH help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana to open the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that can display the satellite data worldwide and by means of the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of those who do - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project with which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but they are also put off .
ships used to be fis@@ sure without license and hardly to count with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats must buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped up Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear annually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member state Somalia announced its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative way to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the ocean .

her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and in The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to break up : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conqu@@ ering &quot; the Land &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they apply as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after Venezuela &apos;s decision was rejected by the opposition to a referendum on a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the floo@@ ding of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the Opposition saw the opportunity of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro said the chance of having a fundamental change , but ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Contributors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of government issue in its latest articles :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of inflation and medicine has been considered ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to return to the country , to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance .
the electoral fac@@ et of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition to support the National Assembly , came to the majority of representatives from the opposition in 2015 , as well as a march towards the Mira@@ flo@@ res palace , on November 3 , should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum on the 3rd of November .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national strike and on November 3 all go to Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res palace .

the first demonstration in the framework programme &quot; The recovery of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the fair@@ y@@ tale that are published in real time , testify will be an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cried out this Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ean . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter feeds images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the message about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators settled in the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ staat state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear sk@@ irts because you could see anything else , which did not have a lot of national gar@@ den@@ ers !
at the same time an inf@@ ograph@@ ics makes the round , which forms the degree of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - it was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signat@@ ures are f@@ aked .
here is your keeper !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others utili@@ ze this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has made little against the devastating economic crisis , and therefore rather busy taking critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the fair@@ y@@ tale always take more on frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or buy .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was posted on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , a Argentin@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano of his father was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city of CÃ³rdoba .
now , in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera proceedings , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , there were crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden , same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years , he held the secret agent for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was right .
I felt like a obe@@ dience .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realise that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ wicz . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of the State of State , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , which is charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced during the years the degree of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy , who made mar@@ tial arts .
all of them called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
passport merely on that they will not lead you one day , and I will save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to the military base .
he said to me , I would become a obe@@ dience .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos; then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he had to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket and ordered to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and enter@@ tained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in , and saw a lying , tor@@ tured on the human being .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body which was en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated there .
they rarely captiv@@ ates a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ shot him with water and drove him a cargo of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and en@@ du@@ red them .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilian , who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were bound by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people sit still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I denied &quot; Why did you use me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed there a man and killed there .
( according to survivors of the civil servant Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this way and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the trial .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be moved .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things .
back then , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was in the military itself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear that war yields a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military separ@@ ator , which one takes off to an enemy that is fought .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als then that &apos;s no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who asc@@ end cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded fur@@ y , beat me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and you stand alone .
we need nobody else to do this !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover with wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes by home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a wor@@ rying to this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay me a burden what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I think rep@@ ent@@ ance .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , you were ex@@ iled as a dictatorship . but what the bodies let it disappear ?
why kid@@ ding children ?
one day , my father brought a girl to her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog , only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families that were handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rend@@ ous act that one can do with a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners of prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course anything remains always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to show my father , arose during a meeting when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to do with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like the patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which allegedly defended them , they were really good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you were forced to participate in me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Now , show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ charged the first ad .
finally , I knew he was a criminal .
no one can pret@@ end that I &apos;m bi@@ ased . I finally have said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : among them heavier , un@@ lawful imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases of severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera proceedings ended in August 1975 and in December 1978 , crimes against 7@@ 16 victims were finally committed in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 28 cases of life imprisonment and in nine cases of detention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ per@@ la@@ im : murder , torture and rape by ministers . #
all the accused were members of the military , among them former military personnel , former police officers and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of jurisdiction is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , founded in 1995 by the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represent the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but resear@@ ches lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was , so that a memorial could be established there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation errors makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO for &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the transmission error in a center in K@@ YO@@ TO can be extended in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can extend his driving license , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , but perhaps also with evil back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into the social media .
the mistake was assigned to the translator Julian Holmes , a population Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sherlock Holmes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fields of drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore she explained that the error had already been contained in the text , and that the translation was not checked upon their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re sorry that elderly people were off@@ ended by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but are quite a concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this is equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , Senior Citi@@ zens 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
consequently , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period decreased .
the name not mentioned rep@@ orters in the article published on Yahoo &apos;s article comments on light , which show pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; awful drive &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true fund@@ pit for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
to over@@ head , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the basic text , and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case in mother@@ languages . generally , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the terms of language - native language .
so a French native language should translate for example from English to French - not from French into English .
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese company employ no employees with English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may look at lack of understanding , quot@@ ations , or the relatively low number of English native speakers that should learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can make translations of their knowledge internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best handled , to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also common - often with funny results .
the ver@@ wor@@ r@@ ous and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases which arise by machine translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic r@@ prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government that have the funds to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and tel@@ ev@@ ur@@ ities on the internet and television
main page of the Port as &quot; Nav@@ tex con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , on the Venezu@@ elan Internet users , they would have no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances were not accessible from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV .
other online broad@@ c@@ aster records the protests of the protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups who oppos@@ e the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is curved , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider are again closed .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 at the coverage of protests . at that time , the Commission threatened with money pun@@ ishments and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call for violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
ast@@ o@@ unding that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ Elec@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a lock of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
earlier research of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet provider sometimes have to use DNS . it is a technique necessary to answer certain domains of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server replies , or ref@@ uses the request to call on such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ dest oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set up on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ Kamer@@ am@@ ann Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried the protest in Caracas , was put into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V returned to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connection : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ aters will keep access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will get to slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testim@@ oni@@ als of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were just like the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by curator , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission by the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; underlying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which will be edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they weren &apos;t living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , you describe the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money passed its min@@ der@@ el@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ age daughter to another family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do for the countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all those in the framework of a contract that you can not lift .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude is vacc@@ inated by Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed to still be silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one hand is the family , who shut up their daughter in the belief that she will improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and just@@ i@@ fies the exploitation with faith , that she would give someone a chance , who wouldn &apos;t be an apprentic@@ eship and perhaps star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon was held in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of fierce battles . shortly after , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military @-@ members Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the owner &apos;s office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck down as long as with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were pro@@ found@@ ly responsible for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there is no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an intensive investigation on the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if for the first time in history , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exploited not only as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k had to register in which her father had to register , and her father lost his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers had to work all work and started selling sweets on the streets or on the market to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that it was still time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
for example , she clean the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been star@@ ving , but was also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was the power of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , alongside him stand and edit@@ orials from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade her to give the reports of official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept it intelli@@ gently but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone to listen while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in order to say that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , who would speak to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that she would allow her to lose her , she would lose .
yet , it was absolutely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about which Cri@@ bs are exposed to which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , has a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clear that I was not one group .

Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share with advertis@@ ements for cleaning staff in Paraguay .
the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city centre in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
for learning .
please contact you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the display was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country inner , which is to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author looked at once again :
dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I wonder if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log of the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ oni@@ als of former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the natives of the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ani ( in which the workers had to pay tribute to their &quot; wives &quot; ) and the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ rate of them had to make them will@@ ingly , that many girls and boys are going to go into a system of slavery in which they are easily victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ature attributes social media to social media to register at the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians recently voted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agree to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , a place would be established , which is to be commissioned to provide citizens to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law user would have to register users with their right names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ves and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt is independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ it@@ ters and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft cannot be imposed on how the Egyptian authorities will make up the registration of the user , that the Egyptian government is not able to sign up at the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary report and support of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telec@@ ommun@@ ications ministry , and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook is blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at the national level around Facebook . as of those , it would be necessary to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known so far , that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive research institutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , says Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they must be set up a powerful surveillance system , which must apply for an approval or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this means a backward system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry them to a tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft has to be discussed at the legislative Council and the Constitu@@ tional Council before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with one pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ izes and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislation against Cy@@ ber @-@ Crime in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those who was intended to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to oppos@@ e protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natur@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards from the war in Iraq

this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the contribution is published here as part of a agreement to the content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGOs work in Iraq to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub @-@ type of le@@ op@@ ards that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to by po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video therefore proves that they have a recording of a big cat in the cinem@@ at@@ ist , breaks Raz@@ a in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , Raz@@ a is passionate about a different side of their country , which is not only from war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is preparing for wildlife areas in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the progress documented in the northeast of Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , has been making progress in order to re@@ build the lives of those in the last six years . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ f@@ ect of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , who had to experience the earthquake and the tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring districts of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were inevitable , because the tsun@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture has even experienced a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local point of view that adv@@ ances six years later in order to re@@ build the local people &apos;s life .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics from the Japanese re@@ build authority as well as pol@@ l results of the people themselves .
the housing position in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that , until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned subst@@ itu@@ res ( box@@ wood , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i scored the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima made the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , one still tries to settle for six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by insist@@ ing ( covers , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to move into final replacement homes .
after thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in favour of dom@@ ination .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such comfort .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated cases had been evacu@@ ated after the disaster in central heating , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ect of pre@@ f@@ ect
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , which opened its doors up to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of fisheries har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports are resumed its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tsun@@ ami and atomic mis@@ ery have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ect of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be used again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 6@@ 90 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o paper also reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
to determine a total image , the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked about the status of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the native people in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident inhabitants must have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who have to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , atomic fact that Japan had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lasting replacement houses .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas are still more than 50 years old . they are still in correct propor@@ tions to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the project projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , you often recognize that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , and remember our perspectives , and remember that the world is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we &apos;ll see exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention as they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photograph .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia had hit him with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors resear@@ ched this Saturday and now put it in a artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly within a few days of rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the images there is also the vision of the police officers who was attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the advance of active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he hits Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his r@@ ammer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten by demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care , his face would be on TV for six months and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ itation is just about to divide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also recorded in social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile have 10,000 Brazi@@ lians Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been dealt several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he has been attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in Sek@@ und@@ ar@@ ana , and here we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has hit him with a stroke stick .
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where there were brutal police officers to protest@@ ers last Friday .
polic@@ emen were in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for speakers , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , the police asked for talking to violence against protest@@ ers .
it also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media passes the street protests by focusing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a bro@@ ader glass window to illustr@@ ate with a photo their title pages .
the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ made bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of moving people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any type of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also maintains a absurd , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ ative meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by the head@@ lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest@@ ers on confron@@ tation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of re@@ induced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , hundreds of sugar cane factories included the doors in Cuba ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no notable sugar @-@ harvest@@ ed on @-@ site .
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane factories .
after the creation , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its annex@@ es , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ uting daily to factories , who still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a sol@@ vent @-@ h@@ eter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane ro@@ bs does not ro@@ bs his sleep .
he heard that there are in the east of the sugar cane factories , which are in operation after a long time , because they have been preserved .
that was something he could not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stands the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , the bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the land several decades ago , but the bad experiences are no more curiosity .
why was the Cuban sugar cane shut off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and barely competitive they were un@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regional Court Inspec@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go down with safety in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same was in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as a soldier is known , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the Word he most repeatedly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all of those question@@ ed are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first half year , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , addressing the address and date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ i Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every escape .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ days and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received his letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will to a halt at the factory , where he helped them .
with each part which he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area from Cuba and the most important workplace was obl@@ iter@@ ated .
in many cases no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the mun@@ icipalities were created , in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .

after two years , the People &apos;s Church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane has completed , or better said than they began to cancel them , they also listened to the road to this paved road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establ@@ ishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future point of view , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , their production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene was back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest@@ ing the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a rebel@@ li@@ ous person , yet he gives the lies that they told him not .
they tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene is working at age 65 in R@@ ente , not because it is missing on power but because he is bitter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is thus increasing the young participation in talks such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever the sense comes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &quot; yo@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a street stage in West@@ kan@@ ada , at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , how important is the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always know the languages of First Nations .
in the following song , that the wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the chorus is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on Earth my days
this is the day where you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead to our youth .
this is how they can do what they determined the Creator
in the comment section , the readers and supporters of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ quiries ( which is also published on his blog ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , will be located close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( covers , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish , which is served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
there are a large number of these small businesses in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which also produce those plastic dishes , documented by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they do not even ask them any more . a new trend , however , turned them into a show@@ y mobile accessory and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic coating decorated mobile tapes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ es refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food exhibitions is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support .
for this dirty bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we have also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , which contains your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the coma .
some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura and salmon have been used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist@@ bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ill@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes you can watch under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # , Cru@@ ises , Cru@@ ises , Cru@@ ises .
if you would like to know more about the origin of these trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which will dev@@ ote the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fighting against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico the mi@@ sts and killed are regularly found in statistics . this reflects , however , not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the grapes or on the churches , who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind every bone , in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories are countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds will never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn with drug traff@@ icking , and tell stories about people who were told in the struggle between prosecution authorities and boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only let us fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ickers , and all the mun@@ icipalities should therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) is telling these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have set ourselves , go and go to graves after the people we have loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she won &apos;t pay her out because they demand a death certificate .
where are we going to get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; to explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and govern@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquain@@ ted with disease and sens@@ ations for a few years now .
I &apos;ll be over newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which actually only can come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is reli@@ eved or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be in@@ different or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ickers ) that he is great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ender , when they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories are going to blo@@ t numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor &apos;s place that they were justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to talk about that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als have been pill@@ aged for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but their family had broken apart at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it goes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are apart , the better .
they included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill yourself .
I asked myself in these terrible days if I would dis@@ miss my deepest emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how you weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the first generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is an orph@@ an and he tells himself to teach himself how to make a egg cooking , potatoes are s@@ own , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw that were shot by armed men out of a passing car .
as Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 as a crime through this organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders on public safety and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secution called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country .
few stories are still living in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ aches in 2015 , its goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Nikl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages where it is linked , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about lifting a rum@@ or or un@@ mask a fake .
but how is the years since something the first time di@@ pped ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photo a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading to draw trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this mis@@ coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it also raises questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tor@@ tured the place S@@ ange to the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa had been neglected in the second largest country for years and devast@@ ated the streets in the region became dangerous peac@@ es full of perc@@ ussions that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to the victims .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses burnt and knot@@ ted corp@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ added photos of the event form the grey scenes of this day .
up is an example of this .
it shows rows of glu@@ ed bodies , which rise up on the ground , while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same picture was h@@ acked out several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but in fact , real but not to be attributed to the following trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ erian towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses had dra@@ stically reported by atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sm@@ iled , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win B@@ oko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture came back from the DR Congo , as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ chie@@ fs ; Africa Check has documented direc@@ tives to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a proof of measures .
one step further further personal comments such as this example wron@@ g@@ ly send the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the painting from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the le@@ thal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a bl@@ unt , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ ings like the following that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken by an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an has said that mon@@ ks and politicians would have taken part in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to expos@@ e this information .
the original contribution , which last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source named , had also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to Th@@ an Being this statement , but had not taken the image from the DR Congo in connection .
the global range of false data
traces of this false cl@@ ut@@ ations go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse photo search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the original image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private sites , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have given examples of abu@@ sive use and associated with the respective countries , on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples of the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other ) can use several examples of abu@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false cop@@ ulation of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or server that are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or false reports .
the countries in Grey are examples that are available in the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably due to counter@@ point examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

the picture was considered as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise awareness to the relative number of the dead and compar@@ ing media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was report@@ edly au@@ tho@@ red by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Martos &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre , there were a discussion group like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to Fal@@ con .
from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , generators and sides in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye exhibits no longer completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and to be isolated in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly according to the original withdrawal of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or available .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions regarding the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religion wants to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth studying how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer give those pictures .
with social media , there are sixty people who are un@@ inten@@ tionally depri@@ ved of having the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decorate the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that it is equivalent to images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and viewers will des@@ elect and assist the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as violent media effect on it , others help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss for@@ cible represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture has something suggests , but what actually can be used from the context or completely mis@@ used mode . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , any exam@@ inations of false grants should also consider how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog unveil@@ s the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( Z. d@@ t. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ avoid@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist tough every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression is not enough , therefore a full explanation , and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant with this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example , you will find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba yourself to have your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having dar@@ ken@@ ed in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you can analyse how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of this &quot; in@@ surg@@ ent &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; that are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is going to cope with the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , who usually places in late May , are due to heavy rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ onia O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the banks .
after a statement by the disaster centres of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud win@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were taken into 304 secure position .
the rain has dropped out on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the floods in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene rati@@ os of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos provide an impression of the scale of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with resi@@ du@@ es of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ch , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in floods , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da also flooded with G@@ alle also flooded because of the floods of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has five aircraft for rescue campaigns , and another five are completed for transporting emergency deliveries in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if there are any search and rescue teams dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all those who want dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ ate app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year , after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me has introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; button to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance from assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as well , they led an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key to result in more than thousand requests and 150 successful tre@@ aties for flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population Sri L@@ ank@@ as , in which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents bring in need to safety and afford help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this prevented the loss of other human lives , the population Sri Lanka is now the long way to recover norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me their children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ ies we have rights for trans@@ gen@@ ders .
we are in a sea of um@@ bre@@ llas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ ies against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has set up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different types . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim &apos;s drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , who like I do not fit there .
kidn@@ apping will be compens@@ ated
I am not able to get alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you come in mind when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western presentation , religion Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which colon@@ izes Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid dismant@@ led the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand still today .
our politicians , the news industry , and Hollywood kept it continuing .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how to domin@@ ate the powerful , incorrect an@@ rative of our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA won &apos;t even vote their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced Saudi women to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group ex@@ its &quot; control &quot; to the other .
this powerful nar@@ rati@@ os weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans who had been brought to slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has taken our collective imagination , deeply and fla@@ wed , that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the objective of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ik@@ an@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the kind that we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rati@@ os of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African citizens .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my first parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was new the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ poll@@ uted Muslims and Americans .
but am I in@@ fer@@ oci@@ ous Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes , or take my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that carry all Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we don &apos;t wear all bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or in order to be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make efforts to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by the current band of a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bia and experts for counter@@ feit detection , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is to manipul@@ ate .
because of the stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than a stranger , who breaks the head@@ scarf .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the United States , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity that is so wide and complex that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but was born to Muslims in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque , in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : faith , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor , my Rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that would separate our houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ omin@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I kept it in my arms , and you can defeat the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , evil that can be seen and evil that cannot be seen .
my Muslim faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging to my grandmother is the picture of my grandmother mother@@ ly with her sisters ; as they win a competition from the art of the flor@@ ist in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi Sac@@ red ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , that can almost be used by heart .
Muslims means to speak the prayers , which she told me when I have a bad day .
Muslims are to be , as she taught me to refer to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah M@@ ian , what God means , is my only lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people who has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which established a company with the name Ehr@@ ing British East @-@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time , my grown grandfather weep .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India , who was not able to close his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , their families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world like at stake .
to be known , to know that Europeans in the last two centuries Europeans have called &quot; colonial countries &quot; to colonial countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown over a Muslim country in front of a century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir sub@@ jection of the British Empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before they were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim stem of the 1.7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged history .
it means that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that were not exist@@ ent .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is native to the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , the story it tells four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that four@@ teen years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we say black live .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ im@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , constit@@ utes the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our constitu@@ ent ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion provides more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are er@@ ect to er@@ ect enormous and privileged people on this bi@@ dity .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ atures , which began with President Bush and President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration , who takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders on people from just across the countries which are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars which we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and about those that we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study titled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants presented a scientifically conclu@@ sive picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in relation to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous figur@@ ine prints in our news editorial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral vide@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increases Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m concerned with this difficult global point in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion dollars .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists exist in the dark corners of the Internet now exist now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier it had not yet been given ; now they have great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the history of which I was not aware when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to an obsc@@ ure Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b lane in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that ren@@ ders our humanity , a story is l@@ ur@@ king where someone is made to a &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation with Islam@@ opho@@ bia is taking place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools to see us or we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why did I tell this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led to and people through the creation of the &quot; others &quot; in the public performance , being a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions on the role of whose , deliber@@ ately and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it is my girlfriend and in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because there is no president in which we haven &apos;t bom@@ bed a new future , while already en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are bombar@@ ded , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ l@@ kunst wants to preserve urban language variety
stories of events , by Flickr user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with somebody in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities and appreciate .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed to the children born there .
for the work of the project :
the mass mortality in the world can be avoided if we do cities , we don &apos;t have to forget the diversity , in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often related to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to don@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers do their story in their own language and translate , or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the audi@@ ences are on it .
they cry out laughing and emotions than the language no longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the nar@@ rative of the nar@@ rative of the nar@@ rative of the nar@@ rative .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara told the F@@ able of H@@ oses and Pa@@ vian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the importance of his f@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is that to speak to a audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his sense of inclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !

with the aim of a new examination in the public debts of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars on a mass rally , on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and civil organisations involved in a mass rally . the march began with the pu@@ gn@@ an Capit@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the city of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( the front of the neur@@ on of debt ) and the Roman Church of Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ate of re@@ en@@ forcement of debts have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico tells that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies that are responsible for debt to be paid for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our labour conditions and re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the State High@@ lands in the USA - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , focusing on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside , measures imposed without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens are at risk to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration was named &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for its freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
in this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher , produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , blown excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ jun@@ ctions ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book which has been published last year and released here is a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on site to look over the m@@ ist , who surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ dra @-@ prison &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have no information about his current state or position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own fate , actions , and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of tim@@ ely extreme beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the developer of open source and digital activity has been detained by Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , which themselves proclaimed themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them into consideration by an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his position and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently survi@@ ving the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , founded in Bas@@ sel writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were predic@@ tive than the work that he began to re@@ build with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to create the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bas@@ sel then could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strip in the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not conclude this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel told me English , even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always dealt his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least in theory without that they actually stopped in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission of trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
she ding@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from the Arab into English .
the book is available freely .
book cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I fail in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the concern at the moment in which we embrace us ,
it doesn &apos;t matter to me any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the jail of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words
I carry a passion with my passion ,
if your eyes say good
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and to smile on your absence and to smile .
I am talking about myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year passes , my soul
while
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of Monster
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al @-@ Ass@@ ads regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption , director after the release of the release was ref@@ unded to previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of a government after half of his sentence was returned to the workplace where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good leadership and immediately requested his re @-@ setup in the company what happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which exclu@@ de the request , there would be no obstacle to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company had no disciplinary procedure for his imprisonment .
however , many residents are not doing the action well .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , to re@@ prove the company &apos;s decision :
imagine a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we consider is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the conflic@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the firm apparently doesn &apos;t have any reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contra@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to prison and killed half of them .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become integrated into the company which he helped to add damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is like to be paid for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not offer any moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he is ins@@ ulted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has already rewarded anyone who has already ins@@ ulted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza missing the mor@@ als and serve to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead just served yourself at the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand it became an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , which was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cat@@ ching and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous national represent@@ ations , as he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the f@@ ather@@ land for his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not move from its amb@@ itions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also dis@@ advant@@ ageous :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat down for 10 years and came free .
and today the company is taking him out of the contract which he wanted to be again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Script Dec@@ ision ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook is blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means k@@ ich@@ er@@ pe@@ se or tie @-@ age .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the renowned social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese type@@ face ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ language in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given an extremely dis@@ advant@@ aged con@@ notation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the people in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the effort to fight rock language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself doesn &apos;t call itself automatically h@@ ass@@ language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have kept doubt for the use of his use .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; that contains the same letter as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eboo@@ k.@@ s A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in spiritual ways if she knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by taking a word game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles a rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ aber is the opinion that she must decrease H@@ ass@@ lang@@ ing radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook should be analy@@ tic before it loos@@ ens all posts that could spread rac@@ ism in suspicion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ s the word automatically .
the automat@@ ism will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what you should do instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the words below .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( chair ) .
the good thing is that these dre@@ ck@@ ly nation@@ alists , the H@@ ass@@ language , received a fairly good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action is able to send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply to use a new word , or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new guidel@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the mail &quot; the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts about people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate talking of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed by Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma due to its platform , but it does not work .
to th@@ icken such words will bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems like to have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found they have made mistakes , they tried not to rec@@ ti@@ fy the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted Po@@ sts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , that would make them a huge turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun and write the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in the context of h@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts are taken off the net . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have not abst@@ ained , but have been removed anyway :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just to try whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ideology and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to extend their voices and influence , increasing .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ otherapy should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have to flee to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , who critic@@ ized H@@ ass@@ words on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of having the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , rather than on the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is conclu@@ ding with the children .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously decided to announce that this practice is supposed to offer , so that the tender age is now 18 .
prior to this change of divor@@ cement , some members held a Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state did not inter@@ fere , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is an contrac@@ tual partner of UN &apos;s rights prevention , which is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago , and at 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that ende@@ av@@ ours to abol@@ ish laws for children before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition was actually un@@ complicated in this fact , and at some point , doubts arise , whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which could be discussed , so that he could be discussed by a simple majority in the law office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update to re@@ post Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children before was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one oppos@@ ites them .
after previously approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed to children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lov@@ ell Francis , who ordered a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has used too much time and unnecessary od@@ or that has veil@@ ed the heart of the thing , but do you know what ? it is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day has finally arrived :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ous News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society speaking openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties that were against , voted for the law .
the children before is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ gar@@ age@@ ski abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have made him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook is therefore in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law thought it was quite legitim@@ ate if Mahar@@ aj was going forward against the law , wish the most social media users , they would address the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we take place so commonly speaking , in a way that we invite you to talk about the problem in our bedroom , that the state , our daughters said that they are possibly mis@@ used , would you be ab@@ used to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to carry on the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ d@@ ations or continue the norm , although there are laws they are subject to .

although many techniques have been used to use comp@@ iling tools for blocked web sites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , the most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category .
although Turkey has been locked in 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been described since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the platform remains blocked , several Mir@@ ror@@ Pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ cent@@ ered pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator @-@ machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is dis@@ mis@@ able in spite of the pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) we put everything from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this stage was carried out ir@@ respective of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it merely deals with screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ist similar to similar mir@@ ror@@ pages if affected by Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open &quot; Podcast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you are access@@ ing a different URL , which is not the original , so what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server is guiding the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .

used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned motives and washed colors .
it motivated itself a camera to wear and attempt to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring to the international stage in Nep@@ als .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention to Nepal as animal world .
he described on Facebook , as this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that was a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to gain a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying as they look .
and he should know it , because he stood up from face to face to face ,
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the bu@@ y@@ ke appeared . he immediately takes us , and he star@@ es me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to do in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of as@@ ps . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , it became Indian women to speak the name of their husbands .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally written to Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid women with greatest care to express the name of their husbands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a p@@ oo@@ ing or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences should they ab@@ used the norm , the practice of life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ le@@ a and viol@@ ated by their family and the village community after having called a married family name .
the tradition does not call their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have much less just@@ ification to fear , if ever , they should not come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health guards and house@@ wives , came to the main part of the city quickly .
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the mining of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs to exile from H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and runs this clubs .
it tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shows in its discussion round , acted by women who did not call their husbands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of their husbands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a burning which they all have to be du@@ ly guilty and never question@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this will be viewed as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , had never been named at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh too long after the video was finished .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him by now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members were a family , especially girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to run the discussion with a practice .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they had called the name of their husbands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra above the breaking of a century old tradition , in which women never married the name of their husbands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole practice she was only ashamed of himself , and another decided to release the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by completing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ alin , having broken with an old bra , the women decided that they actually would try home to call their husbands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not stop talking his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of an participants was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ oma red point on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
he only laughed and I stopped to carry him .
the other women have not stopped complete with it , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him in some days .
for many women , a discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet have I worked for some things , such as our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never said so honest .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ sa course , a far shirt over a tro@@ users , wear ; they didn &apos;t get married .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of its own clos@@ ets , mor@@ ality connected with the sar@@ is and more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to do it .
to the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly getting into the roll@@ ers :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
just one or two still say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in a discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the he@@ aps for more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home to home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on the 29th of June this year the H@@ ash@@ tag was a brilliant ( Beatles memorial day ) to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans cast out memories and este@@ em for the Beatles .
the Beatles &apos;s visit in 1966 in Japan is considered as a turning point in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , during the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
humans soon became clear that they had no choice when the Beatles had to receive with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ichi Is@@ aka , President of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! - Today the Beatles memorial day is in Japan . it is now 51 years ago in Tokyo .

the Kit@@ sch of the Beatles survive everything .
today , Beatles memorial day is .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should show or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese are of course also pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the familiar places that are related to the band .
- If you love The Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to miss :
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages sometimes cannot be sk@@ inn@@ ed enough :

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ traff@@ icking , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , probably wor@@ rying the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has called a number of operations to stop the pract@@ ition@@ ers .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and in a row they were standing that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a single man &apos;s gold contained gold have been revealed , declared the pol@@ ari@@ zation of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that the following attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of murder for ob@@ s@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to cross a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania where the campaigns were developed to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he warned those who have to travel to the country :

the persecution and murder of many individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ov@@ em@@ a , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has also taken over the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief that has existed in power , according to which the victims were in mind .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were killed in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ ggers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which indicates that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty which Mozambique is facing :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o moved to international community attention after his Adv@@ oc@@ ate had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver cancer in the final stage of the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( sovereign debt ) after he joined the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o covering democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China still gets views of the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , po@@ ets in Liu X@@ ia , allow to release or allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should print pressure to enable Liu in abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government decided not to do anything with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon tro@@ ups to China as the exports have been mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel committee brought up his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to meet his prize .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on the release of her , as she did in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet all visits and receive , which they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility for the treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as it was with his satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one speaker of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities were announced on June 27 , that the embassy of the Chinese authorities will open not only Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia liber@@ ate her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US Embassy brought a fur@@ ious answer from China to himself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as travel fol@@ ly and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they have claims according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push , Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
earlier , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had big concerns , whether the host could sur@@ ate Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on to provide a proper medical assistance to Liu and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer explained that Li@@ us Mrs. , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to maintain and free the rights of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Office urged China to release China in a statement on 29 June , Liu for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments which he needs , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government had welcomed the country of Liu in the country , there was no further information to find out whether France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the fortress in Taiwan on June 27 , on the 27th of June , decided to release a greater tolerance towards those that require a peaceful solution to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , also called for China to allow the sick intellectual disability to allow himself to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 at Liu &apos;s very worried and asked that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took , and for whom he had been strictly punished , to a more harmonious , more stable and wealthy of their China had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I personally felt very moving and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of State of New York , the Minister of State , New York , re@@ marked the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , as compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people go wrong .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ ing to create this valuable land , we can say that we actually have no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a run before the responsibilities , a bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one can &apos;t measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of its , it seemed inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the topic of the Th@@ as , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers of power appear to be present democr@@ ats , leaving the dist@@ orted logic , as it fits better to their power .
the end of the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
appropriate questions tar@@ ts with non @-@ responses r@@ ational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustr@@ ate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the City of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by announ@@ cing his comment on the blog , he indicates that one should begin to read the complete ro@@ uting of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the elections in Singapore are so un@@ ob@@ ese even if we are enjoying ourselves free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as a leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which awaits me - was I agreed with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MAS@@ EK review explo@@ res the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; or was it a rebel@@ li@@ ous speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
because he plays an important role within the government Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ure work their military service , they defend only their city , but not their country ?
who must pay the Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of one country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade , which is in Singapore , is always a town : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ure ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the land mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with rum@@ ors of parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series is Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation happens , it is considered polit@@ ely to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fication , usually the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook inside with anger when they are kept for Americans , but doesn &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know himself , there are little ones different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their ruck@@ sack when they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was already before 20 years ago , when I started traveling through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian had always worn small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a health health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is also known as the toler@@ ant country to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
for example , I would do nothing if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , known as a &quot; nice &quot; means to be bl@@ ast@@ ically - like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
to be harmless , it is called un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and in@@ interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good , if one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one .
I would even go so far , to say that the desire is to be free and alone , a major citizen of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own business .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not talking about the fence across the neighbors .
the warm heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au consider the stage to show that Canadian has more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
musical video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video which took over the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and reg@@ ain the civil government despite their promises to continue the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules gave him his girlfriend .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers to the persist@@ ing military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video was shared on Facebook &apos;s highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists addressed the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it is with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these images of the video which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has witnessed over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be referring to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which grants absolute national issues by the commander of the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11 . rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to disgu@@ ise activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitors the online content and supervised those who have been sl@@ ander@@ ed , is pro@@ secuted .
Thailand sets a strict society against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy is their decision @-@ costly U @-@ boats , although security experts have warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax avo@@ idance .
in the video , it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , a further problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they have allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and threat@@ ening Internet users , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

life continues in the ruins of the viol@@ inist cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but his scars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
several ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called viol@@ inist cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people are in these viol@@ ins .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas are symbo@@ lically named for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to stop this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and nur@@ sery schools who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who lived in this place once lived and have their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty population live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mara , in the other villages it looks like .
the Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families , you recognize on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw instantly .
&quot; our mother forbi@@ d us that we let us take a photo , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her friend , and suddenly , they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of scenic products for their own demand ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come about the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread on the villages in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mara to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart is forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial help from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives .
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls to T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ gett@@ es .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village of life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Ab@@ ch@@ asia Country broke away ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative town in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will take some thing , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s nur@@ sery was once found , they hold pigs , cows , paraly@@ ses and chickens .
she tells us that it was initially a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly work , and all the same as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation bowed himself to the end , a little boy ren@@ ames us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball who then rolls up the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
while running , some of them cast stones to the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , caring for in@@ genu@@ in@@ eness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts Africa on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ est@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ ck was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears with a friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ est@@ ula , he is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a kor@@ allen @-@ pink tan and golden ear@@ ring in a ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , abra@@ sive walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but hundreds African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it is more quiet but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on boxes outside .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they are mass@@ aging them away with a bal@@ m away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yoghurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ ck .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together to travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction site of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers , and we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that her guests have often send text messages to her , to greet them , or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of its work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ est@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
these w@@ inters have added Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family to migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ ets can be sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking center outside .
Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I have crossed the border across the desert , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others will not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ est@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted him to sque@@ eze the money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ est@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ giving , she gave him her roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ected by Twitter @-@ Us@@ ers , Gif@@ ts , Cru@@ ises
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district received a mobile notification ; in which it displays the District Government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities will also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , having replaced messages with a private We@@ Chat Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was asked to determine the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users alert , how much time they spend online and to control their own home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it out .
this introduction is in line with other measures relating to the control of digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , ad@@ ressed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme ignition and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet de@@ preci@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media Out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media @-@ based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published photos from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen had checked the residents if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by trans@@ gres@@ sional technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( Quali@@ fied Emis@@ sions : 1 ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system , and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council , to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on operation of their computer and communication instruments .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; to be registered at local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible confusion , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything sh@@ out after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and make sure you &apos;re alone on a place where all important matters are missing .
everything has changed after and after dis@@ b@@ anded , and a truth revealed clearly , both from inside and from outside .
one that makes its name all honor .
one that has settled in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that no met@@ aph@@ ors allow .
but when you look back reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood , and everything sh@@ out after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the A@@ xis of the disaster . you will realise that you are tra@@ pped here between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they still arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of security things said - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us , while he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn apart during a peaceful protests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all city districts were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time , it was silent , for the wrong time , even if I did not have high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ ms down , after the power supply had stopped in the quarter .
I broke through the silence , using several times &quot; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &quot; from my home maid .
I heard my voice contra@@ di@@ cted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were brave enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends closed to me ; we f@@ aded us to a magnificent picture , full of my expectations and full of ful@@ fil@@ ment .
in such a moment you are aware that you have liberated the spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t care in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can return your voice after you have trained all the way to the office of security from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men . my father already was there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know what to look to me in my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I said : &quot; I would not have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to watch you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret my word from what I said .
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father at the same time . &quot;
&quot; his father is right with this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this curse lies in me until now in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months .
I cried out the farm .
at the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office , leading through a pass@@ age@@ way to the individual cells .
I regard all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they were able to share a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ established communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ ror det@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hur@@ rah , he eventually responded to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle age , which is similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , there can be no markings apparent in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me sounds like me ? &quot;
all answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I &apos;d like to ban@@ ish a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance I still hear &quot; all@@ ahu ac@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around these times the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror of the person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ play at the 13th s@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
that was the secret to protect and prevent state security from us to prevent and prevent the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ gest@@ ion map and locked the narrow view@@ point of their world view .
this is no house , this is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared for the listening room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is so ahead of me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin so much more important with your life than to protest to protest and protest to demonstrations that will soon get a close anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws after a friendly interview have become an ordinary communication agent .
when and how this happened was in@@ significant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , although I had done nothing to earn this sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck me so much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your hen rejo@@ icing in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t compete with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry had not yet eaten him enough , so put the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or whether that belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us out of their perspective , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , which is why it is next to an electric charged staff .
electricity flows my whole body , enough to store my entire area .
my semi @-@ nack@@ er body which was stretched out on the floor was the perfect black@@ board .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which gave me a few minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning ful@@ fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he turns his screen to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine spots to discover .
he lives in the top of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who oppos@@ e the conservative majority and her old proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only available in his home town in Amman , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as a man who restricted in his thinking not restricted by limits , and it can have according to their own statement by people who have suffered from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he swe@@ eps up a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against the American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considered his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation , &quot; he also called himself , even when he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions so , &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because it is a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs into water . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan , in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public intake of food is illegal in Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has some weakness of breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little coffee to do with protest against Islam .
basically the sm@@ iles speak in warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette into the nose in first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open air , especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is simply avoid@@ able to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to land not to land .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , the second time already .
some par@@ liament@@ arians , who support the Islamic State Front - argu@@ ed the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , which contra@@ di@@ ct the sexual and traditional nor@@ ms of the country Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country .
in an interview with CNN , the member of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; just &quot; said &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also asser@@ t the commitment of the band in affairs , such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world , who is the ancient and legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila was regarded as the &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply fl@@ atter@@ ing rhetor@@ ic , but actually an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality reflected in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b came to reduce traditional sex nor@@ ms by performing his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ i@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ den@@ ced uni@@ denti@@ fied woman , whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who should actually trust .
in Jordan the number of &apos; hon@@ ors &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours in 2016 reached its cul@@ mination ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder , or domestic violence , to provide proper ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law for frag@@ mentation from 1954 , women who are detained in danger of internal violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their release is often a long @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be shy away on issues that have long been t@@ aboo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but cle@@ ars that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it approaches to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was dre@@ am@@ aged in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes up the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are in the core politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whether faith or failure , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that there are hardly anybody in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals are still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to memor@@ ise later that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and in his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res openly to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still stayed with his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems still today .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be taken to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian secret service seized several former government officials and members of the teaching Association , with the reason they expressed themselves on comments in social media and related to problems deeply rooted in the country .
given its opinion , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is according to the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a stand@@ alone type and take . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not dream about his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be inspired by music , art and literature , a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stri@@ de definitions and an artificial way of immediate demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually held in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus and has been taken over for over a thousand years , and from a time date , in the armies of Japan to the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to catch some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a common centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two star@@ cars are just to be seen .
nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true tru@@ e - and yet a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high dar@@ ker was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to stick to the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like that of the Fris@@ bee .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medi@@ oc@@ - and South American countries - an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Brazil ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers which can make this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , has even been inspired by an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &apos; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts join each other to show who can create the ec@@ centric look as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions it gives on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange their guns against hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and get a training in the hair@@ dres@@ sage , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunity , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , what we are very proud of , for from love to children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

the following article is the revised version of the &quot; love message &quot; to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , which has published the International online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel spra@@ yed , bring affection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la recur@@ r@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , her country is the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help her part : after years negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the signing of the peace agreement as important that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of Colom@@ bian houses , however , there is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhetor@@ ic , and round about the clock their weapons , they have to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , it has to take in its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colombia have joined together and to help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was carried out on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the man who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need much needed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was talking , he told her to share his love with people this year , the most urgent action needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which is now ready to build their place in society and take a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story of a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign by the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves on how they used to stand up the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of shel@@ ters from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a team member of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience such as :
having handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guer@@ illa fighter .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa boun@@ ce live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter that wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him quite firm and sat down beside the Gren@@ at@@ cher .
perhaps he was sorry for war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC ended already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country more fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magn@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people who haven &apos;t had heard and had no election right now , and to recognize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality in which the country lives , doesn &apos;t hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and so much harm can teach us , and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote in the example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
Colombia has been proph@@ es@@ ied , that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to lift up the weapons and protest to their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and give sacrifices , for we know of their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be coming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ unding report on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not only been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , some of her experiences dealt with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines after reports published by reports , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ca@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a tran@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ et@@ ons from the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
she was afraid of her life in the US .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day , I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , he was a friend of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there was no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya to eliminate these shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round of my W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was right there was a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke up the last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung s@@ ash .
OC Media : in which emergency wings you were laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor got up and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats in February .
they called me , they wrote me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbors and some remote relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they ordered absur@@ de demands : some said me , I have to prove it , that I had to say above without the streets . others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my family that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have gra@@ ins size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed of your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a rope around his neck .
thank@@ fully the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window , a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy .
my human rights hi@@ kers checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you escaped ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to price their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought her to register without me , without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
got to and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know already , in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
only in order to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the sex meeting , however , this is a t@@ aboo subject .
I still bear some traditional c@@ ash@@ ish elements still in me .
as much as I wish , I can not overcome this sou@@ l@@ ish barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I really give trouble to look like the person that re@@ members themselves out of their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have survived ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who was eating one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so my I , they probably invite the relatives , these will take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are men still arrested by gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : an acquain@@ t@@ ance of me says it wasn &apos;t very many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or left from their relatives to make the Kad@@ y@@ rows dish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they may present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim , they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people have not simply disappeared , they are immersed themselves , to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source of that information ?
Sabrina : I just tried someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after her beard grew .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken .
until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports until now . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise one would not have allowed those people to shave ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to lead us to the ci@@ vil@@ isation , but ultimately threw us back into the quar@@ ry .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were kno@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Department of Security of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an alternative solution : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they make fun about the sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed they were ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this gift time kept ?
Sabrina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he became Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about mor@@ ality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people started to change in the city .
those who had been sm@@ iled and laughed at once , looked at once with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel like the situation in the republic intensi@@ fied .
OC Media : what activity do you want to do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I start them to hospital and help them get food types .
I don &apos;t leave a p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people themselves when I sw@@ elled them .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ ot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to know with foam before the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils in them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ aret , which Russians also have which ; on the entire planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go to the mosque and while Ram@@ adan fast - live together with men .
you know , many think of tran@@ si@@ veness to men who love men , and they believe that you have been changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different living settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal , but my last intimate relationship is already more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n a rise of suicide within the pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ ry community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the past few months , there has been a strong increase of suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named Jas@@ sim Mor@@ amaz@@ i was a desper@@ ate situation in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sto@@ oped down for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , who can work in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s human rights , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anon@@ ym@@ ously .
a video made on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited herself , firm .
some people made it quick to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani @-@ Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide bom@@ bed in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on the spot war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im have been hang@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have a thing in common : it was all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and felt because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , based in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
in front of a century , the Arab ancest@@ or was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most poll@@ uted and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continued to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ounces gene@@ w@@ azi @-@ Arabs systematically developing jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a multitude of dem@@ yst@@ ers , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab @-@ haw@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director for Ko@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , says Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; by the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ mad@@ azi men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . the reason is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab labour power , the local Arab arist@@ oc@@ azi is dispos@@ ed of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policies of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make them live outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ azi , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because speaking the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab arist@@ oc@@ azi must end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alert , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the primary reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be found in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who refer to themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women in the past or later occur in various fields of life to a glass ceiling and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of that and I suffer twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ cally women , on black women from the di@@ as@@ pora ; if I mention , as we have always been ab@@ used by breeding , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they all agree with that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which gives us black women on two @-@ fold ways .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
in one hand , I want all men , all men , and all men , neither skin colour the same rights . on the other hand , I can &apos;t join myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman is ref@@ using to consider in@@ just@@ ices in their thinking , which refers to both the sex and skin colour of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted , and I won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
I will not try to settle white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain silent for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was formed to give a home to women of different approaches and bor@@ dering from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to release myself full of femin@@ ism and called me to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , instead of having called me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever that we can define black women after our own ideas and take us into the spher@@ es that will be created for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately recall separ@@ at@@ ism and mar@@ gin@@ alization , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can emp@@ t black women and women of other cultures , because I do exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in a environment , in which my life has never been ski@@ pped , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ addle to contamination : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports un@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement this article will be published once again .
in the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe , with a special concern through the Kurdistan region of Iraq . its mission aims to make people realize the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of the pollution to his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from the whole country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is committed to safegu@@ ard the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sum@@ s up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced in Er@@ bil by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and a multimedia journalist , produced in Er@@ bil , in Iraq .
the focus of their work lies on a lot of considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ress communities , their stories can tell their way .
Paraguay : women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ sk . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ lich@@ Ã© ) , who reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship has passed some time and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could one do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a further Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena used to show mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the ak@@ ad@@ ful display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later the second wife approached their ad .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women occupy one at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , to be victims of violence at all .
In@@ clu@@ 1 blo@@ ws and Statistics 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not sub@@ n@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay Law : good approach , defective implementation , and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Document@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various data and reports that show but not even ans@@ ati@@ ze the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General , 9@@ 600 ads were suspended due to domestic violence . at 70 % of which it went to violence against women .
86 % of ads by police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace dishes . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the indicators , 40 % of women who were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics show not the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish women &apos;s minist@@ erial , Ana Bai@@ ardi also appears only a few of these off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay with psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to any woman who will be ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ences , the prosecution authorities will not be adequ@@ ately documented as many women have been murdered each year by their current or former partners .
in August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , every ten days a woman dies a woman because of violence .

invisible abuse and a legal system , which does not accept
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she did not want to do it , but then she never regre@@ t@@ ted them .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but for two years she carried out the psych@@ ic violence of his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognis@@ able :
never thought I would have been victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened to under@@ mine , because they are deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mariana requested social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had dropped out of Carlos and had not left him before .
it almost seemed like they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ aks should at least have some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who did not originate from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was har@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the women &apos;s statements serious .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with psychological abuse .
their wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads on the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an imper@@ ative legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly for money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay Law : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of mi@@ stre@@ aks is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , poses great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ On@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks ahead to explain Fem@@ icide to an independent off@@ ender and tou@@ g@@ her as it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are generally forbidden in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill had intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process cost , which must present the victims of violence even if they just want to receive and receive a secure accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial means available :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a revolution must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be normal .
those who are silent in view of these facts makes a guilty ple@@ a and carries out that the perpet@@ rators will be gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund such a long message until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment does not apply more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases had called domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions about the changes are falling apart .
the Section concerning Rec@@ on@@ ciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the att@@ ain@@ ment of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continue to face attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by the Office of the Information Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Catalan authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later returned .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had placed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the lack of security forces , in particular the domestic civil service , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of speech , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists to fol@@ ate , inti@@ mi@@ date and in@@ filtr@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities appro@@ ves peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights , and activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since she was founded in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after having appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands with judicial authorities and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial choices .
in the report government officials accused the Jud@@ ge of Jud@@ gment in Oman under pressure to impos@@ e a verdict in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : fac@@ eboo@@ k@@ page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , he was charged with Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , captured by the ISS before the special department and upon arrival of the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS transferred the Deputy Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acts as chief editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the information minister had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and spreading of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by a fault of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ grab@@ bing the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public audience and sl@@ ander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ran@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ran@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after being able to use the use of an information network for the distribution of material that could represent a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ran@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) and it was released on 22 August 2016 in front of the verdict of the Court .
on 26 December 2016 , the Appe@@ als Court acquitted Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also empha@@ sized the decision of the Ministry of Information , to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again agreed , the paper sees itself exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information sent a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information held a further statement in which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister issued another time against the Court of Appe@@ als , the publication of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman at the latest time .
further injuries include the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation .
due to the continuous shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly release and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protecting the press freedom in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under all circumstances , human rights activists and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their righ@@ tful human rights work , and without fear of author@@ ization , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans , can ex@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organization that offers human rights activists ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent to the right to gather peac@@ efully , and offers protection to them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research : for a lack of global healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical needs on the African continent .
illnesses like AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the phar@@ m@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps to develop own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth in the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , precisely when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the exhaust health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is based on the application of research . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just rigid a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion about important current science themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
what do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we just put solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being M@@ acher himself .
the solutions that we get is often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are being supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people coming back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you hadn &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special research education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa on Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise related to challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that journals are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the United States to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding for the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant which was cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was given only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ ts of sal@@ ts can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he discovered that more salads were patented and that it could not be used for bre@@ eders .
the patents have not only been used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cro@@ wing leaves .
over the past few years more of such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ridges . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and expert for food security provide the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds the salad , but it is now longer needed , because his work is increasingly difficult for more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like I would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ der in which I must break away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do this now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go to too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they with@@ stand trial , no one can breed more of a new sal@@ ts , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the features he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is always larger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red tube sal@@ at of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather like this would come from the IT range and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was sum@@ mon@@ ed in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , just called Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders may undertake to use others to freely use the seed seed .
this does not mean , however , that they can &apos;t continue to do business and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders may only allow others to breed their seed , to absorb so own varieties - two aspects which are prohibited or mandatory by many plant pat@@ ors .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
magni@@ fying prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seed plays him according to him , according to biodiversity , rights of peas@@ ants , rights of the farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or not only little by using seeds of natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ec@@ ologic agriculture , or not . &quot; who would like to buy our aim of ecological sustainability in August or September 2016 , as such as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know the way that this vegetables is bred , is threatened .
nutrition sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative undertake to make others their seed still free to provide . thus , you are in contrast to pat@@ rol seed and plant features .

Os@@ si supp@@ orter argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies are endangered because of the increasingly popular intellectual property rights based on plant material , which thus has always been restricted , in@@ cess@@ antly reduced .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in its PhD @-@ work with genetic variation in car@@ rot and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the cards are protected as intellectual property , whereby it is not only used for plant bre@@ eders either .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that plants are pat@@ ched as wheat or carrots in even wider style .
a Mat@@ ter of Vis@@ itor
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such by which their taste or their colour improves , due to those th@@ rive in certain environments , and threats as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is affected by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , because the changed conditions are much less predictable .
in an email Monsanto , Monsanto , Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , recogni@@ zes that genetic vari@@ etal diversity is generally important and also decisive for mon@@ san@@ ity &apos;s activities . with four gen@@ ban@@ ces and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company ign@@ ites the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property restri@@ cts other bre@@ eders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant variety &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone may follow as soon as the patent has expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often , these statements help others to come with another method at the same result .
such a protection does not in@@ hibit innovation , but promotes it by making the public more material and know @-@ how available . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this in a different way : 20 years to wait until a patent strap , fÃ¶r@@ dere certainly does not provide innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , the struggle has already been lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general and remains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders are neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves have not been attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible when we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mort@@ on moves to the concept to patented the key features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si management board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , continue its own values into it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are needed to develop mass@@ age@@ way Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , breeding in its varieties of this concept of farming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is just gent@@ l@@ ingly . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than such as Monsanto are ) patents have the most smaller seed companies , either they reject the pat@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ent@@ ants : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than a company that patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need new material for my catalog since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent one is protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; indeed the US seem to be the leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works with farmers , helping them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation agreements with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders at the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding distinguish themselves from country to country , so because the Os@@ si obligation is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , she speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no law nor a law ; now it &apos;s to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ment of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , that the organisation is currently expanding a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which will drop the official start next year .
a merger between environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ s - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - have to make it possible to share seed and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
in the report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a connection , by the Lu@@ by by Os@@ si , hopes to see it soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food revealed especially to where and as something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind her food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information unle@@ aded , despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian justice and the Constitution . even if it has never been so difficult to un@@ cover these targets , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I also confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the lock and not to admit that . we insist@@ ed to keep our task further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities have blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web sites to victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no more access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now , the blog , which he established in order to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , the provider of which has also been native to Zi@@ adas blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces while he reported about the student protests and taking a video as the police trained physical violence against two students .
his article revol@@ ves mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him :
to block blogs , however , is very old in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the locking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is successful to give me the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post the c@@ ens@@ orship at first .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , the Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the lock of vendors working through internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began , began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter to filter , to which users could have access to Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will also be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the duties of the decisions are taken behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to proceed in court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people argue .

day for day newspapers in whole Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ z ro@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in 2017 reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all day and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they agreed to establish a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex break , etc . everything , however , is published by the ci@@ vil@@ ised standard and what only happens in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , said that this decision was not for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist wrote to the newspaper that there are according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is aware that a war course , when he is dist@@ orted , can also be used , cru@@ el@@ ty of the police who only shoots and then asks questions to conce@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist in Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , however , argu@@ ed the violence as a &quot; war &quot; by the media and could make it difficult to attract account@@ ability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personal , education and historic and self @-@ este@@ emed Neg@@ le@@ ct of public service .
in memory : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we see the murder rates per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , empha@@ sizes the security policy of the State .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , belonged to a police unit whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela through the use of a massive police forces and a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . but for a few years , the U@@ PP developed however , after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor churches , who should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not represent the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio , as a war , draws serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls to the state , means and ways to use the typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; squ@@ ir@@ ated balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the residents of fav@@ elas will continue to suffer in Rio .
one week ago , it is now that the police enter the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to sei@@ ze the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a res@@ eller died as a result of kis@@ ses who fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , chie@@ fly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative from the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
in particular , the region Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians , on August 21 , 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these rebels have stood under siege areas outside Damascus which led to siege to local people , or by tun@@ nels and control points of mu@@ g@@ gled food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the years of block@@ age traditional food items such as meat has become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves the Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi do not belong to the traditional , in Syria , and are only very rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , they make it an attractive source of food for many local residents of besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the directive of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , writes Global Vo@@ ices , that already for three years has been fighting for this project , and pressed his relief from that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in agreement with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge for plant@@ ing mushrooms , such as L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel short@@ ages , locally manufactured fuel are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eila said global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; apprenti@@ ce &quot; farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom re@@ aring from various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ation of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for extraction of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to insp@@ ect people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice to the victims of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed in many districts of Portugal on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and sought for justice to the victims of the fires in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with victims of victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions , spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which is monitored by satellite recordings in 2017 , there are about 500,000 acres of forest burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
entirely Portugal is burning in the perceived sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the happening :
the sigh@@ ted tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the civil protection wasn &apos;t able to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy so far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al stated by the Federal Government of Portugal , the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o explained :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
there could have been a similar tragedy in the forest of Lei@@ ria , as the roads were blocked late in June . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in locations with a high tide of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko will be question@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extensive proposal on the forest form , which led to the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was controlled by the mun@@ icipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a relaxing of the law that the construction activity had case , if the applic@@ ant had an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble wood , looks like in a v@@ icious circle , according to which fires of this species continue to spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , however , that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of oc@@ tober , when people were looking for information or trying to contact relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : use f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial to that f@@ ate@@ ful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who did not count the fires : there were more than half a million access@@ es this year .
even the founder asked for help :

during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had conquered the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was sitting , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at supper .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
the boy should break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him down to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b@@ zan , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt uns@@ elling .
the Taliban always came closer to their hatred and Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ vo@@ af was in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ ion . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went into Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , Afghan refugees in Iran had co@@ ined from mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows allowing us to indul@@ ge in at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without paper in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing towards the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in Parks and went to a church that divided twice the day food in helping needy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a type of second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a admission center , if they officially have an application for asylum , which may still be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , depend on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ worthy life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after spending several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af stuck his entire savings in the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis Success Story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operated , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the staff are mostly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are however far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and need the same options as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af decor@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packing and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest@@ ers on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a bill which fore@@ sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to use the social networks to use social networks within six months after the most successful legisl@@ ature at the website of the authority , as well as their ID number .
those who failed this step may be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the En@@ tri@@ ge of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty parliamentary members , is currently under the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another deputy was issued a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tou@@ g@@ her pen@@ alties for ins@@ ult the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , ins@@ ulting , as well as government agencies , is already pun@@ is@@ hable by law and monetary policy , however , such legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would under@@ score a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested by Egyptian police officers while demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers who had fought against the military coup against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on the 20th of May , because the prison conduc@@ tion , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison into the court@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a human rights of human rights , head@@ lights of among other weapons , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza told the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to hear well @-@ fed documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours by listening to Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been inspired by the President of the Republic , according to the plan explicitly stated a controversial bill , the business@@ man and during the former regime was backed by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused official am@@ nesty , provided that all of these un@@ lawful just@@ ification would return .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how pre@@ si@@ di@@ mental plans will look for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the dis@@ closure of his sources by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release which journalists are entitled to safegu@@ ard their sources .
however , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness .
will China force the users of social media , to present their identification ?
according to new rules of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission to write or share messages in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the regulations also indicated that the registration will be required with the full real names . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts believe that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in discussions within social networks , it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese networks have proposed in the social media , these regulations have only been selected to protect the citizens of journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is leading a list of online services that will allow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the Government to make use of contents and force them on request to avoid user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Turkish court had the lock Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English articles that support Turkey supporting the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Marit@@ ime Affairs and Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave up the site because it works for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that deals with groups to em@@ press a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey blocked the website completely . it is , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop , sque@@ e@@ zing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a specific consultation on increased surveillance powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time , and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the government has cons@@ ulted the telec@@ ommun@@ ications company and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public may be transferred to the Ministry of the Interior .
