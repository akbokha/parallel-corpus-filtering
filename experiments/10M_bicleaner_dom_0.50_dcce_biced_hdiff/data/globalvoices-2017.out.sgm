<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, American authors and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who were the Supreme Court of Justice, who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "according to Method Man," "" "It was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he moves with his skin.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that has ever been nominated by the Party nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans, who support these bigots, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not put Trump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, as my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journal's journalism, people from all over the world takes a deep glittery person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trump Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance is also the contrast to the generosity I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for life long and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace and my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those of them embody values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump bahelled his way to the appointed republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The idea of the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they were either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as a rattle.</seg>
<seg id="34">Rearrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led to us this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "this is superficial and respectful and suggests a inability to understand those that act and think in a different way." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters are, of whom the majority are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among the tourists - but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments a way to overcome the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">Yet this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelihood.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, with instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun under the direction of Favio Chávez to transform parts of the case in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double bass player, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets, trombone and percussion which were all produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the first time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them were not living together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violinist made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from reprepared material and this is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Müllers) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the wormest ones - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that has been speaking about international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in liberiian waters of illegal fishing before it was searching for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries had been upset so far and slightly inclined to welcome a bill of legislation on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu remembers a senior member of the Kenyan fisheries authority. it is part of a team who discovered the ship time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO stop illegal Fishing (stopping fishing) was founded." ""</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar, which had then displaced the premiums from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are spinned together and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it goes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers support for FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition, which is concealed, is concealed because of it is extremely difficult to rise up. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate mising of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and with the information between individual countries, these actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">The individual countries, for example, can exchange or experience lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activity or details, which were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues ships of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark ships that fish in banned areas. also, such suspicious lanes can detect - such as that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the ships involved a fish catch, where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to the assumption of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is about significant financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and this is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform already mentioned was created to gain a total of 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who enter Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms, especially attracting the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">These actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasian seeds, fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use specifically the lack of international cooperation and control the weaknesses of a non-seamless control system," "" "Long." "" "in the past, a ship could be illegal and a country could say 'You mustn't run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. and just this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks, which distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities and it has been pursued and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with Interpol, the international authority on combating crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system, which aims to help FISH, suspicious ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, also helps to pick up the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Head Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch on for example their automatic identification systems, with which they cannot be operated by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system which connects various information carriers. it should help FISH help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana to open the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that can display the satellite data worldwide and by means of the position of each traceable ship in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of those who do - that is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has to run a similar project with which a global system allows tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but they are also put off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to be fissure without license and hardly to count with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats must buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped up Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear annually." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "" With safety, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member state Somalia announced its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship travelling under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used towing nets, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the take of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the ocean.

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano of his father was forced to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, in the context of the large La Perla-Ribera proceedings, Quijano is now in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, there were crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden, same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he held the secret agent for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a obedience.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not realise that my father was a thief, folks and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriewicz. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, a time of the State of State, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced during the years the degree of atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and he said before a court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child, and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy, who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All of them called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overhead, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the basic text, and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case in motherlanguages. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the terms of language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French native language should translate for example from English to French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese company employ no employees with English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may look at lack of understanding, quotations, or the relatively low number of English native speakers that should learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can make translations of their knowledge internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is the best handled, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also common - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verworrous and puzzling phrases which arise by machine translations, show that this technique can't replace any human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic rprints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government that have the funds to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household in which they weren't living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her studies at the university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, you describe the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money passed its minderelage son or her minderage daughter to another family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do for the countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all those in the framework of a contract that you can not lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness statements, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, as the feeling of gratitude is vaccinated by Criaditas, guaranteed to still be silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "the one hand is the family, who shut up their daughter in the belief that she will improve their position in society and" "" "make something out of itself" "" "to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes care of the girl and justifies the exploitation with faith, that she would give someone a chance, who wouldn't be an apprenticeship and perhaps starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín arrived in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of fierce battles. shortly after, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military-members Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the owner's office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck down as long as with a stick on Marín until it suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in life of young girls.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were profoundly responsible for the death of the girl in the paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there is no further Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an intensive investigation on the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asuncion as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer Alvarenga worked for four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that it was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, she clean the fridge, clean the living room, polished the furniture and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the progress documented in the northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, has been making progress in order to rebuild the lives of those in the last six years. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a prefect of prefectures in Japan, who had to experience the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring districts of Fukushima and Iwate were inevitable, because the tsunami had lost whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture has even experienced a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local point of view that advances six years later in order to rebuild the local people's life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics from the Japanese rebuild authority as well as poll results of the people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing position in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that, until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitures (boxwood, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi scored the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima made the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, one still tries to settle for six years after the disaster, evacuated by insisting (covers, casetsu juutaku) to move into final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in favour of domination.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such comfort.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated cases had been evacuated after the disaster in central heating, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefect of prefect</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, which opened its doors up to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of fisheries harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports are resumed its operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and atomic misery have affected large areas in the three prefect of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are in the" "" "nuclear barrier" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo paper also reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total image, the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated people. she asked about the status of reconstruction and also how their empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native people in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local resident inhabitants must have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who have to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic fact that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, lasting replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are still more than 50 years old. they are still in correct proportions to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the project projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, and remember our perspectives, and remember that the world is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we'll see exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat issues that often get less attention as they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="627">The popular community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no notable sugar-harvested on-site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were lame in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the creation, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its annexes, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to factories, who still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solvent-heteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis in the sugar cane robs does not robs his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the east of the sugar cane factories, which are in operation after a long time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he could not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstands the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, the bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the land several decades ago, but the bad experiences are no more curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane shut off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and barely competitive they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report" "" "Regional Court Inspection" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same was in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all of those questioned are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first half year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official documents, which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, addressing the address and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Uli Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every escape.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was overdays and the letters were always more common.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations Communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do with Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014, workshop managers are offering mobile tapes directly to schools and youth centres, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and lived in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is thus increasing the young participation in talks such as" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-unacceptable" "" "or whatever the sense comes." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">"" "this video of the school" "" "Na Aksa Gyilak" yoo "" "" in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called "" "" Highway of tears, "" "" a street stage in Westkanada, at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered. "" "</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate, how important is the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always know the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the chorus is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the strophe is available in transcript, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day where you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead to our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they determined the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, will be located close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (covers, "plastic models of the dishes") of each dish, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a large number of these small businesses in the Kappabashi district, which also produce those plastic dishes, documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">"" "" "" "for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they do not even ask them any more. a new trend, however, turned them into a showy mobile accessory and other gadgets." ""</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic coating decorated mobile tapes, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoes refrigerators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food exhibitions is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this dirty bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which contains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura and salmon have been used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetizing form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skillrile plastic dishes you can watch under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter hashtag #, Cruises, Cruises, Cruises.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of these trends, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which will devote the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with disease and sensations for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'll be over newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures, which actually only can come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is relieved or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be indifferent or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) that he is great. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offender, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are going to blot numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbor's place that they were justified." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill yourself.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if I would dismiss my deepest emotions, but the answer is no, because I forgot how you weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the first generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells himself to teach himself how to make a egg cooking, potatoes are sown, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies which live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"" "" "" "but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby." ""</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody bodies of his father saw that were shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a crime through this organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders on public safety and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político created the data journalism project Narcoaches in 2015, its goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it is about lifting a rumor or unmask a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years since something the first time dipped? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used misleading to draw tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This miscoupling of image and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it also raises questions about our desire for pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker tortured the place Sange to the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected in the second largest country for years and devastated the streets in the region became dangerous peaces full of percussions that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt and knotted corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.added photos of the event form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Up is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of glued bodies, which rise up on the ground, while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same picture was hacked out several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but in fact, real but not to be attributed to the following tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses had drastically reported by atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and stores were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind," "" "said a population on Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were smiled, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture came back from the DR Congo, as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mischiefs; Africa Check has documented directives to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a proof of measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further further personal comments such as this example wrongly send the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The painting from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the lethal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a blunt, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by the violence against the Rohingya, postings like the following that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by an Saudi-Arab news page, which in 2012 claimed that President Myanmars Than has said that monks and politicians would have taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to expose this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which last updated on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example, you will find words from Vanuatu Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba yourself to have your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that you feel after having darkened in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with somebody in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of major cities and appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the work of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality in the world can be avoided if we do cities, we don't have to forget the diversity, in which people don't have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often related to understand" "" "consider these events instead" "" "listening to" "" "to appreciate, to donate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers do their story in their own language and translate, or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation is that the audiences are on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotions than the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of the narrative of the narrative.</seg>

<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can get in contact with TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for its freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">In this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher, produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, blown excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Injunctions (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book which has been published last year and released here is a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge, have been working on site to look over the mist, who surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the "" "" Adra-prison "" "" list where he was sitting on 3 October 2015. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1195">"" "" "" "the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own fate, actions, and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of timely extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the developer of open source and digital activity has been detained by Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra-Prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel was based on a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"" "" "" "Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, which themselves proclaimed themselves as the insider of the Assad government and put them into consideration by an alleged death sentence against her husband." ""</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently surviving the director of New Palmyra, a project, founded in Bassel writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Basle's cultural prototypes were predictive than the work that he began to rebuild with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to create the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merges Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">"" "" "" "bassel then could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not conclude this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel told me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always dealt his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least in theory without that they actually stopped in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission of trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the concern at the moment in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">It doesn't matter to me any of the dangers,</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assads regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director after the release of the release was refunded to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of a government after half of his sentence was returned to the workplace where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is about Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment on four other defendants with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good leadership and immediately requested his re-setup in the company what happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic which exclude the request, there would be no obstacle to refer to Cambaza, as the company had no disciplinary procedure for his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents are not doing the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, to reprove the company's decision:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Imagine a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we consider is that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the conflicting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm apparently doesn't have any reasonable legal steps for applying the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as "contrasting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to prison and killed half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become integrated into the company which he helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is like to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not offer any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he is insulted him, I can't believe that someone has already rewarded anyone who has already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza missing the morals and serve to serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead just served yourself at the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a hand it became an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, which was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, catching and - incidentally - prophetic Redner.</seg>

<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dreckly nationalists, the Hasslanguage, received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>

<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention to Nepal as animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that was a leopard on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>

<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to gain a collaboration with the authorities to gain global recognition for Neptune nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood up from face to face to face,</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to do in the Bardia National Park recordings of asps. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to give women that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences should they abused the norm, the practice of life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Olea and violated by their family and the village community after having called a married family name.</seg>

<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the fineness of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the mining of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera to cover practices such as children's heirs to exile from HIV- and AIDS-infected, and runs this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shows in its discussion round, acted by women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify herself.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the name of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a burning which they all have to be duly guilty and never questioned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this will be viewed as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, had never been named at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh too long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him by now on his name.</seg>

<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin, having broken with an old bra, the women decided that they actually would try home to call their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not stop talking his name.</seg>

<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped complete with it, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, a discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet have I worked for some things, such as our identities to our husbands, never said so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a salsa course, a far shirt over a trousers, wear; they didn't get married.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of its own closets, morality connected with the saris and more, smuggelte Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly getting into the rollers:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"" "" "" "the women in a discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the heaps for more freedom of movement or their own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home to home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (sovereign debt) after he joined the Charter 08, a manifesto covering democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon troups to China as the exports have been mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee brought up his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to meet his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of State of New York, the Minister of State, New York, remarked the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable land, we can say that we actually have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a run before the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one can't measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in view of its, it seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the topic of the Thas, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers of power appear to be present democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The end of the final week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarts with non-responses rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the City of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing his comment on the blog, he indicates that one should begin to read the complete routing of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "said the elections in Singapore are so unobese even if we are enjoying ourselves free and just elections." ""</seg>

<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore is no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who as a leader of a growing generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which awaits me - was I agreed with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review explores the weak points of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam "benign a mistake" or was it a rebellious speaker?</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role within the government Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapure work their military service, they defend only their city, but not their country?</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Brack was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears with a friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapestula, he is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a korallen-pink tan and golden earring in a teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">"" "this nickname" "" "nickname" "" "is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, abrasive walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but hundreds African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people in full small busses and the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is more quiet but this year Ramírez welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they are massaging them away with a balm away from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurt beard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together to travel together and that Africans are already talking to WhatsApp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction site of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers, and we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez told that her guests have often send text messages to her, to greet them, or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of its work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapestula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">These winters have added Valenzuela and his family to migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the Bustickets can be sold too expensive to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking center outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border across the desert, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others will not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapestula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted him to squeeze the money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapestula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, a single-giving, she gave him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the hallways the travellers consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Today a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flashed with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hairfleets which you made a client, some photos of her grandkids and many travelers more, boy and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she shortly imagined her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron" is repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication equipment in Xinjected by Twitter-Users, Gifts, Cruises</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10 the mobile users in the Tianshan district received a mobile notification; in which it displays the District Government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, the app is said to" "" "hinder the app" "" "to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities will also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, having replaced messages with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app was asked to determine the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, together with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "", "including videos, images, ebooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users alert, how much time they spend online and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">"" "" "" "this app with the filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle." ""</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or steal it out.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures relating to the control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, adressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme ignition and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the Media Outlet" "" "Images from the China" "" "media-based media-Outlet" "" "Images from China" "" "published photos from a Checkpoint, on the policemen had checked the residents if they had installed the monitoring app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by transgressional technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(Qualified Emissions: 1) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system, and therefore unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council, to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on operation of their computer and communication instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" to be registered at local police.</seg>

<seg id="2070">My cry had not yet eaten him enough, so put the pipe through a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he turns his screen to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine spots to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who oppose the conservative majority and her old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only available in his home town in Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as a man who restricted in his thinking not restricted by limits, and it can have according to their own statement by people who have suffered from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't open it openly, he sweeps up a special inclination against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considered his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something with his identity as "Palestinian gearing of the second generation," he also called himself, even when he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living conditions so," emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because it is a man," "" "while he pours into water. it is the holy month Ramadan, in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public intake of food is illegal in Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has some weakness of breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little coffee to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the smiles speak in warm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette into the nose in first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open air, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is simply avoidable to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan, to land not to land.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, the second time already.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic State Front - argued the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which contradict the sexual and traditional norms of the country Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the member of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" said "because of the sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "" "" "many also assert the commitment of the band in affairs, such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world, who is the ancient and legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou's Leila was regarded as the "progressive supporter of human rights," which continues to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply flattering rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear-crystallized reality reflected in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib came to reduce traditional sex norms by performing his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have voirehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a evidenced unidentified woman, whose arms and legs appear to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'honors' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours in 2016 reached its culmination; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder, or domestic violence, to provide proper ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "" "" "according to a law for fragmentation from 1954, women who are detained in danger of internal violence," "" "for their release is often a long-long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be shy away on issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but clears that he is his music that is full of explicit approaches to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was dreamaged in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes up the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words" "" "that's what you want" "" "- whether faith or failure, Hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there are hardly anybody in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals are still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya to memorise later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and in his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still stayed with his homoerotic poems still today.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the Caliph, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be taken to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian secret service seized several former government officials and members of the teaching Association, with the reason they expressed themselves on comments in social media and related to problems deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given its opinion, the concert Hdaibs is according to the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a standalone type and take. Jordan has denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he did not dream about his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be inspired by music, art and literature, a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stride definitions and an artificial way of immediate democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which can be heard as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually held in August in many areas of Tohokus and has been taken over for over a thousand years, and from a time date, in the armies of Japan to the Northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to catch some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A common centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two starcars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nonetheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true true - and yet a breathtaking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high darker was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to stick to the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the Frisbee.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road noise and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other medioc- and South American countries - an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Brazil), Arturo Vidal (Brazil), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers which can make this elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity, has even been inspired by an annual event, the hairdressers' Batalla de Barberos, which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts join each other to show who can create the eccentric look as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions it gives on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange their guns against hairdresser tools and get a training in the hairdressage, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunity, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year, and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district, what we are very proud of, for from love to children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the "love message" to guerrilla fighters, which has published the International online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel sprayed, bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two Columbian activists Leonardo Párraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cartas por la recurrciliación (letters to reconciliation) that encourage young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country is the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help her part: after years negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Forces of Colombia), which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signing of the peace agreement as important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of Colombian houses, however, there is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric, and round about the clock their weapons, they have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hate to guerrilla fighters, it has to take in its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia have joined together and to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was carried out on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the man who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need much needed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was talking, he told her to share his love with people this year, the most urgent action needed.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which is now ready to build their place in society and take a new life." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story of a common history of peace," "" "they say." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign by the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves on how they used to stand up the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of shelters from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can go through in only a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between," "" "explains the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a team member of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience such as:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guerilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, where the guerrilla bounce live), I saw a guerrilla fighter that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firm and sat down beside the Grenatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC ended already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country more fair.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"" "" "" "those people who haven't had heard and had no election right now, and to recognize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, doesn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and so much harm can teach us, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote in the example Darío de Jesús Monsalvo, archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia has been prophesied, that after disarmament peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to lift up the weapons and protest to their rights." "" "and this is also totally justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"" "" "" "we give you our word, make our contribution and give sacrifices, for we know of their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be coming." ""</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, some of her experiences dealt with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ law in Chechnya took over the international headlines after reports published by reports, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milcaina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, the suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is my male name on it; but the doctor got up and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats in February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, they wrote me - Related, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They ordered absurde demands: some said me, I have to prove it, that I had to say above without the streets. others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny, and say that I had not changed my family that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grains size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed of your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window, a car with a darkened window and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights hikers checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you escaped?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to price their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelief happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her to register without me, without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Got to and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "" "" "at the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe in security, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already, in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only in order to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the sex meeting, however, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear some traditional cashish elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can not overcome this soulish barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I really give trouble to look like the person that remembers themselves out of their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have survived?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who was eating one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "" "" "so my I, they probably invite the relatives, these will take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, evidence that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced by blood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still arrested by gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me says it wasn't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, especially those who have no rich relatives or left from their relatives to make the Kadyrows dish." ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they may present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim, they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people have not simply disappeared, they are immersed themselves, to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source of that information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just tried someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after her beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise one would not have allowed those people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who have heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in Grosny, when I was still there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Scharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to lead us to the civilisation, but ultimately threw us back into the quarry.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Department of Security of Sharia has never hurt me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an alternative solution: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they make fun about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed they were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this gift time kept?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he became Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had been smiled and laughed at once, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel like the situation in the republic intensified.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you want to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn too much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreffs, gatherings, I start them to hospital and help them get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave a penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I swelled them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is alot.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"" "" "" "this is nature, it has nothing to do with religion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to know with foam before the mouth, that there is no coils in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have those who have the cabaret, which Russians also have which; on the entire planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and while Ramadan fast - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transiveness to men who love men, and they believe that you have been changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truce.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal, but my last intimate relationship is already more than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on-site medical research: for a lack of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Illnesses like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious impact than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmafirmen are a major problem.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the United States to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding for the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant which was cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was given only by its own ingenuity and the question, how many salts of salts can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he discovered that more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents have not only been used for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crowing leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more of such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereals or cartridges. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and expert for food security provide the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds the salad, but it is now longer needed, because his work is increasingly difficult for more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like I would lie in a river a boulder in which I must break away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we must do this now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go to too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they withstand trial, no one can breed more of a new salts, because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is always larger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red tube salat of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station" "" "the station" "" "and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be cultivated in space." ""</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this would come from the IT range and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was summoned in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, just called Ossi, US breeders may undertake to use others to freely use the seed seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they can't continue to do business and sell them. "open source" breeders may only allow others to breed their seed, to absorb so own varieties - two aspects which are prohibited or mandatory by many plant pators.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Magnifying prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays him according to him, according to biodiversity, rights of peasants, rights of the farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or not only little by using seeds of natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecologic agriculture, or not. "who would like to buy our aim of ecological sustainability in August or September 2016, as such as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know the way that this vegetables is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make others their seed still free to provide. thus, you are in contrast to patrol seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporter argued that the future of food supplies are endangered because of the increasingly popular intellectual property rights based on plant material, which thus has always been restricted, incessantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of the Ossi, has engaged in its PhD-work with genetic variation in carrot and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the cards are protected as intellectual property, whereby it is not only used for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that plants are patched as wheat or carrots in even wider style.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visitor</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such by which their taste or their colour improves, due to those thrive in certain environments, and threats as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is affected by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, because the changed conditions are much less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email Monsanto, Monsanto, Carly Scaduto, recognizes that genetic varietal diversity is generally important and also decisive for monsanity's activities. with four genbances and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company ignites the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, since" "" "patents and the protection of plant variety" "". "a patent is basically a plan that everyone may follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these statements help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making the public more material and know-how available. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this in a different way: 20 years to wait until a patent strap, fördere certainly does not provide innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, the struggle has already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general and remains:" "" "independent plant breeders are neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives have not been attractive for us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible when we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in all, Morton moves to the concept to patented the key features:" "" "we do not create the characteristics." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi management board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, continue its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"" "" "" "those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which are needed to develop massageway Herbizide, breeding in its varieties of this concept of farming." ""</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just gentlingly. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are) patents have the most smaller seed companies, either they reject the patenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant of the plant Frank Morton seeks out in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patentants: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than a company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I need new material for my catalog since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself," "" "he says." "" "with a patent one is protected for 20 years before competition, which makes it very easy in my opinion." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"" "" "" "the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information unleaded, despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian justice and the Constitution. even if it has never been so difficult to uncover these targets, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI also confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome the lock and not to admit that. we insisted to keep our task further." ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities have blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no more access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he established in order to circumvent the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which has also been native to Ziadas blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces while he reported about the student protests and taking a video as the police trained physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article revolves mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To block blogs, however, is very old in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the locking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is successful to give me the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post the censorship at first.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), the Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the lock of vendors working through internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">"" "" "" "such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter to filter, to which users could have access to Egyptian users." ""</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will also be worsened that the duties of the decisions are taken behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to proceed in court against these acts." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in 2017 reached the highest stand for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all day and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio, the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published on August 16, the Editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which they agreed to establish a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex break, etc. everything, however, is published by the civilised standard and what only happens in Rio. (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, said that this decision was not for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist wrote to the newspaper that there are according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "us is aware that a war course, when he is distorted, can also be used, cruelty of the police who only shoots and then asks questions to conceal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">"" "" "" "but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners." ""</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, however, argued the violence as a "war" by the media and could make it difficult to attract accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personal, education and historic and self-esteemed Neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not represent the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>

<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without paper in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing towards the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in Parks and went to a church that divided twice the day food in helping needy.</seg>

<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, depend on the hospitality of friends, or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unworthy life of life helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf stuck his entire savings in the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened a fast food.</seg>
