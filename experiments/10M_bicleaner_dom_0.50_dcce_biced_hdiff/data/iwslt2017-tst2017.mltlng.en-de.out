this is James R@@ isen .
perhaps they know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York reporter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he spectac@@ ularly published that the NSA has illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , in which the CIA had literally delivered the dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know , who did not like the chapters ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been identified , and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists .
according to First Constitu@@ tions , media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect identity of the identity they will give . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , when the government joined R@@ isen , he did something that many mut@@ iny rep@@ orters did before him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused , and said that he would rather go into jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were for years , it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can hide themselves less .
instead of failure and R@@ isen , they could do their digital foot@@ prints for him too .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , wor@@ rying his telephone calls for home ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work than secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so , we put the media working on the game , which is meant to be protected by the first constitu@@ ents , because the government has more possibilities to pi@@ on@@ ate all .
but just as technology allows the government to handle rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can receive them from the moment in which they contact us , rather than in the witness .
today there is communication software which had not yet been written when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet celeb@@ r@@ ities , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working on .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents , or send information , as with every normal contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency .
so the government is unable to obtain more information about it , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from it .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies , which je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s to ensure that not only technology players such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to kill their ini@@ qu@@ ities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers , who wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ si@@ ders , who warned us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the greatest data le@@ ak of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; ( meaning that the Real@@ ms and M@@ igh@@ s &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; This week we were asked by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents found in Panama by the resident of Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ lem Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that an ally @-@ member of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has station@@ ed in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next publication , and the next dis@@ closure documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used by some few , to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing it for ten years .
I think many people seem to conf@@ use this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports in the US in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now , it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases function , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even of Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples given connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , less information needs to provide less information to establish a firm than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States allows employees to rip school children .
it also allows operators to rip particularly an@@ gled investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , the susp@@ ect money to the US to buy a house , a yacht .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us really shocked that everyone could make proposals on a lawyer , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as individual waste .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who informed our covered investig@@ ators .
it is not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ate , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may sound very good , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I am quite seeing that a lot has begun to change .
in the last few years , we have seen anticip@@ ation towards more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been cap@@ itali@@ zed on national regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill to both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that rise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who know the problem and use them to end these kinds of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , how I almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked around my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city alone , making a road trip through all the country . after that he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to take away in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Er , just like ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what did I tell me ?
a wild girl in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , at toe points to the door , and my sleep door lock .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me now hangs up in his classroom . he is a teacher now .
that was my first experience as host . it has changed my angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends , who were just waiting for it to be discovered ?
to host people at my air@@ material , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a tim@@ eline , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ate goes out and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can do it to transform fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have wondered how we could earn something . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded &quot; Air@@ conditioning and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at our wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ettes tasted completely different , because we did it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I sent us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ nia , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to create a website dedicated to people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited , that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned to learn all that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you get to things that can be good . we could design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust ?
I &apos;d like to give you a sample , which degree we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comp@@ utation .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to block your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat .
this quietly an@@ gling from panic that you can now sense -- -- is exactly what you feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who is now Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please announce that he is the president of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have imagined only once with his name , if he had told how to come from , how his dog or children call it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you would have 150 advoc@@ ates which all say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well locked cell phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you had to return your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system is vital to trust .
at the beginning , we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative beats .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their findings before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are in terms of age and residence .
little surprising we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
it is a natural social pre@@ judi@@ ci@@ ary .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by convic@@ tions .
when one has less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation found simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you get there .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re saying too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells you too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you make it with design to make this degree op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we did not reck@@ on , the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay out these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business is very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes well .
there were guests who were un@@ allowed to celebrate parties or apartments .
hosts have guests standing in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , if trust has been broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ ing than this calls . it &apos;s sorry if I just think about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ appointment to listen in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately , there had been a fra@@ ction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem .
for people confi@@ ded each other .
if trust works , the wonderful thing can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers seeking heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient health stations .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know it right .
you drive a car in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , every stay does not run .
but these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I was proud about this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with cash transactions combined ?
it &apos;s all about economic trade .
but it simply is just the &quot; rental industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not fair .
share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves , and this changes everything .
being able to compare these things , it is efficient and reliable with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
however , what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place that you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and one with a bar pent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could cook with a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from reason to co @-@ sharing ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would have the thoughts of common part ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ ti@@ zation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were residents offered now . students who were looking for a stay , were offered ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were started .
in order to finance new start@@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has also existed before .
similar websites were already available .
so why has just worked our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that stun@@ n@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da goes past by me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or op@@ pressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terror ?
or simply a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent what I look like .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans my , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee machine -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a W@@ ant @-@ W@@ ant @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ cul@@ in .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you pressing yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : it was then a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , although I felt as a 17 year old girl to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after , stood in question , du@@ bi@@ ed and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , that deep@@ ened with any reading of the Kor@@ an .
sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me to weep .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet anyone loves you ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I later had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and actually lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then this terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end of my breakfast , looked onto the screen and saw the word &quot; rush message . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should one do such a thing ?
I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned the actions of others from one civil war into a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West in the United States to move into a new city and to begin studying .
I remember as I went silent -- when we went silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be known as Mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I looked , and I read the warnings of national Islamic organisations , which says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meeting of you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the warnings again : &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims in the free time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was really stro@@ kes on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this land , attacked our land .
I got the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually say people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
it is only the question : are we v@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is just under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not a tumor in the US &apos;s body , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , mercy and Olymp@@ ion@@ aries .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit to a mosque leads to people to consider other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington @-@ DC area recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
when Radi@@ ation process has been found that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family to say that the person believes the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim Islam is a violent religion .
finally a group like the IS establ@@ ishes their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Mus@@ lim@@ in , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , when you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at it , she does not drive what she read in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me about an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had proposed to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit having spoken it , she brought her silence , and told her that her anger , her sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have given their anger , it was a prime goal for the instrumental virtu@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the link to God and her church again .
instead of using them for their rage , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was an insight as Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you report the test persons , most of which are reported to Muslims , they vote in more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
that is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood fight against Muslims above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it was in advance to the war of Iraq and during two electoral seasons .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to shed the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interaction with Muslims is a early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming all of us .
in the assignment of collective complic@@ ity , it is not only about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet , most generous person who knew her .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did such a young man come from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne by her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon after having posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed it and for us it was not easy decision for which America would let us leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
we went silent with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the hall , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then the Im@@ am had an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembled Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment , I broke down .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a ner@@ ves .
but I wonder what you might say that you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk to keep a think@@ able with deep sleep , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did it with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I have no exception in any regard .
if people appear as an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , it is about to become a billions business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible in research facilities worldwide .
before the air p@@ act in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights reach high speed and acceleration on eng@@ aging space .
they can also build resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today , we want to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our aim is to exceed the boundaries of the possi@@ bl@@ ity in the autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to work autonom@@ ously , it has to know collective , where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start and landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flight machine , which is trying to beat two flies with a cap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping page .
restri@@ ction of h@@ edges is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often provide fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such a question would be , for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand @-@ moving parts , which are sp@@ un to hurt you .
two decades ago , pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that only had two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
a long ago , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ic@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es , and cross @-@ sections , no further pitch or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inside live very much , so it can fly stable , and moving in space .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it right if all of you watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the exterior ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see this .
when flying machines will be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
if you are building them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is falling , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if necessary .
we will demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic chocolate .
the bigger number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes conver@@ ged in a very far distant galaxy are two black holes to each other and faster , they walked so the mass of three prob@@ es in a t@@ enth@@ esis in pure energy .
this short moment , they en@@ lighten@@ ed bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they don &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over into space @-@ time frame , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at the same time .
about 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a growing life on Earth .
since then , Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God bless us - even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss is decided by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ Tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves caused by black holes .
most people held them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational Ob@@ servatory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly enhanced , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational wave of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes carried through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the part@@ ing of my death @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all this what I had worked , is no longer Science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravity of black holes and their ob@@ servatory such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves for 23 years ?
a gravity of gravity is a til@@ ting of space and time .
in passing the shaft the space and its overall content are stretched in one direction and the other hand gest@@ ed .
for illustr@@ ative theory , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often result in a really soft dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each one was stretched out and gest@@ ed in the wake of the waves . the expansion of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o @-@ staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , it would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear strike . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are massive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles are overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things by taking that of several points to perceive the light around you .
at pot@@ ns this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to specific properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them any simple pictures of objects in All .
but by mind changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally listen to all .
the gravity of gravity can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very quickly , you hear the same circul@@ ating with an additional ton@@ er change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu , wu wu !
it is a type of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render the sound &#93; Some@@ one who knows what he must hear , know this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass that turn around as fast as the st@@ aves of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what it means .
two black holes , the th@@ igh@@ tly body in all , one with a mass of 29 teeth , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each other a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
there is the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to study the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in All we can &apos;t see -- convenient or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ water spoke stars in super nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the space .
but the exciting physical processes are happening in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since this op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves perme@@ ate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own night@@ fall .
with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that we have never seen all things we will never see , and of whom we have never seen . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o was in the first attempt to see things which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that contain black holes , as Lig@@ o they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the barrier for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different perspective on the events in All , on the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether I was nervous to put me in unpleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on television live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly that I feared , removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that my life deeply changed , un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my sm@@ all@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ ars , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the leap . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; &quot; &quot; a new setting in my family . from then on , I stopped to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am doing very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a stunning side effect : I was actually completely understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saved my career to play with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things off , revi@@ ve you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I &apos;m producing television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in big style .
in this TV season , I am responsible to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every programme offers hundreds of jobs that never existed before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode of nine days four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are at the same time : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run one another on Thursday night .
all over the world run my series in 256 different languages in 67 different languages .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sol@@ ete . I must find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires , around the world burn .
do you know who else is doing that ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say to you , that all of you , who work so hard if you speak a company like a company or a classroom to take me serious , so that I &apos;m not just doing my computer , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it does not work at a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is , when I set up troops , when I painted a canvas .
as a dream you dream a high tone , a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and uns@@ ett@@ ling , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sound like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume if I explain the sum@@ s that I write about it , that writing me will delight me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work with the TV production , when I began to work and work to create , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this power , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t aim differently than size .
the feeling , not different to be able to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it means ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for the failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask .
to make a clear answer : the more successful I become , the more episodes the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work at the same time , the more I watch history , the more I write story , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the tall clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this h@@ um . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , rev@@ amped , exagger@@ ated , over@@ run .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that her m@@ um is a single work place .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ ama will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ ars , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby supplies .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same titanium work , 15 hours day , performed weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not working , a titanium does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan ,
everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the Sum@@ ma and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if this is what you do , the work you love , suddenly verb@@ ose ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , stupid maker @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you &apos;re doing what you are doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and know how to feel the sum@@ s when you stop the Sum@@ ma if you stop the sum , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I like ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart listen , can I survive in the silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress poses me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to anything and second , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ony . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; swe@@ ars . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m playing Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of sum@@ s , I cannot do anything except to stop .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything that exists are sticky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes down , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The King@@ doms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t immediately happen , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s are coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are if I &apos;m telling you who I &apos;m using shows and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s are not power and it is not labour @-@ specifically .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the current , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the printing of history , which are experiencing re@@ perc@@ ep@@ tive tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it just is love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I rule this rule , so that I can release myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not for me playing just how to work .
the truth doesn &apos;t hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to be at home than at home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , for what a man works better than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m a relaxed one , none of them is .
we swi@@ vel around in the garden , and back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we are m@@ ashed soap bubbles .
I feel mostly st@@ iff , absent and confused .
I always mature according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can do it too ! then they always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a meeting .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they think they want something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie will be replaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes , no longer need it .
everyone can put 15 minutes at the same time , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the same time !
no mobile phone , no linen , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are finished .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my bene@@ factors , my world . they don &apos;t have to be children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s , a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with his own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
in general , to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I am th@@ wart@@ ed and I am going to make friends , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass through myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why don &apos;t allow yourself to treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return , if I don &apos;t work .
works do not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , she ful@@ fil@@ s me and my soul . I will lead me into new ideas . I use it into full turns and I love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s are not i ... no more .
brush and sticky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s schn@@ u@@ ppe that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more play .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the h@@ um , the marathon , which I run , the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ ut , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , bare and new experiences in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think things off , I awake you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work and more play . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us Neu@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , heavy disabilities .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures .
surely they have one of the most well known , the &quot; low@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; they im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it &apos;s really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neu@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
the brain can help themselves with something help .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked in a recording day and night .
I often supplied patients with brain brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain is will@@ ingly vulnerable to brain trau@@ mat@@ a and inc@@ lined the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save lives , one must decrease the cran@@ ium pressure .
for this , sometimes you need to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
let cells grow from a tissue piece , comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to th@@ rive .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , it abol@@ ished Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know still out of the biology class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the body .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they sat down slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand how they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why stay they preserved ?
we do not know this .
we believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear however -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells closely as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark colour@@ fully in order to be able to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step , we planted it on the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we will pl@@ ore these cells into normal brain tissue or what will happen when we use the same cells in damaged brain tissue .
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and so en@@ forced exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ anti@@ zed .
the evidence that show them are these little points . these are the cells we cultiv@@ ate in vitro , in culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained no wise monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did so very well .
when they had reached a stable level of skill levels , we passed the motor mot@@ ic in motor@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex .
after that , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move her hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen in people , they recover spont@@ ane@@ ously until a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys that will recover spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from prior to injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
now , when we see the cells , the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ory plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance at Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must complete about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to see how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the patients to do treatments and rate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
you must first point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West do make a big mistake , as of course , to consider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable awareness .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that &apos;s not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large descendants in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely democratic .
actually democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends that would repeat that democracy would change if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economical model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of mis@@ belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sive and hel@@ pless democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy , our societies are w@@ asted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
with a waste of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently our economies are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts long shadows on the U.S. , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognise his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of unused cash , which may be anxi@@ ous to invest there , but it could be too fri@@ ghtened where it would be productive and in@@ comes , with whom you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that hum@@ ank@@ ind is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 trillion US dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely did nothing but cast out the real estate prices .
so debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds to intensi@@ fy the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low demand advoc@@ ate that it could not invest in which they could not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who could not be true , that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
un@@ wanted , the circumstances bring about , that may cause oil to kill him .
this is my hate with capitalism --
its extremely bl@@ at@@ ernal art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are key to the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a company form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed to many --
women , foreigners , and of course , slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these clas@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of expression &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and not only the right to freedom of expression , but was more important and crucial to them , with equal voting rights in matters of state bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is also quickly burned .
however , our liberal democratic demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came first , as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy was the world of corpor@@ ations -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time in which the separation of politics and the economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually hi@@ ther@@ ed and destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not want to be so earlier ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics within the economy is out@@ war@@ dly and the areas are separate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in such a way a herd of prey , which nour@@ ished the animals , from which it feeds themselves , that they are star@@ ved at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the economy , which has been so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alised by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself , and the power of corpor@@ ations is growing , political goods are decre@@ asing , and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour force and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to put together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the labour @-@ working arms can only achieve a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low formaldehyde levels through automation and robot .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we establish the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ atie , which lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; similar to that in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the machines are serving people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in long convers@@ ations the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; novel utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you some examples , shortly .
in the company &apos;s area : imagine a capital market in which you have money , while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next , and the company -- doesn &apos;t matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and revenues come from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who work , but not in it , and employees working there , but the company does not belong to them . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and couples , and ultimately no emp@@ tied twin tops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued from the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum of which the trade deficit is equivalent to a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have , especially in the background of a re@@ unified Politics and Economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally in whom it pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marx@@ ist because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or are we going to sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we will decide political together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ ary Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for unification of politics and business is ... do we not do this , the technological development will create a massive decline in global demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we see it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely un@@ rav@@ aged .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who mentioned that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the world plays , -- the area of business -- a wholly @-@ democracy @-@ free zone .
in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- do you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can watch now in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells massive to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I felt that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent dis@@ den@@ ying that the eurozone is massive and continues to continue with the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed to den@@ ial this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone have chosen the den@@ ial within the euro area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system , which is not viable to get to life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claim@@ ing that he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the debt recovery program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the credit@@ ors to find a common solution .
but this did not exist .
they just wanted to bring our government only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the dist@@ ortion caused by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s monetary policy imposed on us this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ s@@ ant mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing by somebody who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survi@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we have to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 19@@ 30s , what will happen to me will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for choosing TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
from Roy Price , most of them never heard , even though he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an ion@@ ic and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and contents to make Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right at this turn .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the altitude shows how many shows get this review .
if your show is rated 9 and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , after having looked a s@@ quad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there any more from these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows are like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t matter to get on the left side of the turn , because I think you have special intelligence , to &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle ou@@ ting , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not excited .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon gives you stuff for free , one gets really access@@ ing , right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you are ski@@ pped or check once again .
they collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- a little over the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time in another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he uses data for it , but he does something different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team watched the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then use these data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like the producer , which actors .
when they had joined all the parts they went on a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
it has two very competent , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic seems somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision which you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
the least , what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working so it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with this software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one asks here in the US and for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that data analysis of this company will be used to determine if a release is done or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison is worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data sealed companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way can predi@@ ct -- through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the release of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors the data flow in decisions of life - in the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer@@ ized genetics -- an area in which some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have to solve a complex problem , do not work two things :
first , you dis@@ integrate this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , the single parts put together in order to deal with a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : cut apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which otherwise they wouldn &apos;t have been able to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that did not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions as they compet@@ ed by TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is ast@@ o@@ unding . for decisions using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ja@@ - or No @-@ question &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will take it out later with a technical demo .
I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should listen to the ball in the after@@ ward .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is cla@@ ve and cla@@ ve . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I think this is very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks to go .
because in the end , there is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
