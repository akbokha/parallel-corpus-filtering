<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps they know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he spectacularly published that the NSA has illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA had literally delivered the drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know, who did not like the chapters?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been identified, and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government to condemn Whistleblower and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutions, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect identity of the identity they will give." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so, when the government joined Risen, he did something that many mutiny reporters did before him:" "" "he refused, and said that he would rather go into jail." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">So, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were for years, it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and Risen, they could do their digital footprints for him too.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, worrying his telephone calls for home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how it can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the media working on the game, which is meant to be protected by the first constituents, because the government has more possibilities to pionate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to handle reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can receive them from the moment in which they contact us, rather than in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software which had not yet been written when Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet celebrities, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working on.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents, or send information, as with every normal contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government is unable to obtain more information about it, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from it.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments over the world are developing new spying technologies, which jeopardize us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it's to ensure that not only technology players such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to kill their iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers, who wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insiders, who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "all these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the greatest data leak of history was released.] [the "Panama Papers" (meaning that the Realms and Mighs] have been hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement.] This week we were asked by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents found in Panama by the resident of Moselle Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives an insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moslem Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an ally-member of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has stationed in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervously waiting for the next publication, and the next disclosure documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, will be used by some few, to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to confuse this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havases function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports in the US in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havases function, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even of Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples given connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, less information needs to provide less information to establish a firm than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States allows employees to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also allows operators to rip particularly angled investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, the suspect money to the US to buy a house, a yacht.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "us really shocked that everyone could make proposals on a lawyer, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as individual waste.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who informed our covered investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politiate, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "this may sound very good, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I am quite seeing that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen anticipation towards more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been capitalized on national registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill to both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that rise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who know the problem and use them to end these kinds of intransparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, how I almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked around my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone, making a road trip through all the country. after that he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to take away in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Er, just like?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh dear! what did I tell me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild girl in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, at toe points to the door, and my sleep door lock.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me now hangs up in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it has changed my angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends, who were just waiting for it to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people at my airmaterial, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a timeline, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate goes out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can do it to transform fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have wondered how we could earn something. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded "Airconditioning and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at our wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omelettes tasted completely different, because we did it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I sent us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharnia, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"" "so we presented ourselves to the investors:" "" "we want to create a website dedicated to people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting." ""</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited, that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned to learn all that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you get to things that can be good. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I'd like to give you a sample, which degree we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your computation.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to block your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly angling from panic that you can now sense -- -- is exactly what you feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is now Al Gores's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce that he is the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined only once with his name, if he had told how to come from, how his dog or children call it?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine you would have 150 advocates which all say:" "" "he can really hold very well locked cell phones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to return your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system is vital to trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative beats.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their findings before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is a natural social prejudiciary.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by convictions.</seg>
<seg id="182">When one has less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation found similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're saying too little, for example "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells you too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- "" "--" "" "-- the request will not be accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "Great Artwork in your apartment! I do with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you make it with design to make this degree openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not reckon, the great amount of people who were more than ready to lay out these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes well.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unallowed to celebrate parties or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests standing in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, if trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmering than this calls. it's sorry if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"" "" "" "disappointment to listen in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve our lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, there had been a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, the wonderful thing can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers seeking heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient health stations.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one life, even though they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a car in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, every stay does not run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was proud about this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with cash transactions combined?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's all about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it simply is just the "rental industry" to call it, the thing is not fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">Being able to compare these things, it is efficient and reliable with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and one with a bar pentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook with a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from reason to co-sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thoughts of common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"" "" "" "I imagine cities that allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and amortization." ""</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were residents offered now. students who were looking for a stay, were offered,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubators were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new startups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">Similar websites were already available.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just worked our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that stunningly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda goes past by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent what I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans my, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee machine -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Want-Want-Fitness-fanatic,</seg>

<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication, that deepened with any reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me to weep.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet anyone loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and actually lived the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then this terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end of my breakfast, looked onto the screen and saw the word "rush message."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people sprangen from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned the actions of others from one civil war into a suspect." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle West in the United States to move into a new city and to begin studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as I went silent -- when we went silent -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be known as Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I looked, and I read the warnings of national Islamic organisations, which says," "" "Be careful" "", "" "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "Meeting of you not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings again: "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not a tumor in the US's body, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, mercy and Olympionaries.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant, and to show greater civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington-DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When Radiation process has been found that it begins online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family to say that the person believes the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslimin, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, when you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at it, she does not drive what she read in her" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me about an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had proposed to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit having spoken it, she brought her silence, and told her that her anger, her sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have given their anger, it was a prime goal for the instrumental virtualization of extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the link to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of using them for their rage, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight as Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report the test persons, most of which are reported to Muslims, they vote in more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">That is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood fight against Muslims above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in advance to the war of Iraq and during two electoral seasons.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to shed the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The interaction with Muslims is a early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear is harming all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective complicity, it is not only about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the most sweet, most generous person who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did such a young man come from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne by her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon after having posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerves.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you might say that you have a TEDTalk to keep a thinkable with deep sleep, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, you don't deceive. I am perfectly normal.</seg>

<seg id="402">When you look to Muslims around the world, and I did it with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before the air pact in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights reach high speed and acceleration on engaging space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our aim is to exceed the boundaries of the possiblity in the autonomous flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work autonomously, it has to know collective, where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest standard." "" "start and landing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine, which is trying to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters it can float, and thus has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping page.</seg>
<seg id="426">Restriction of hedges is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "during our research, we often provide fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the cause." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand-moving parts, which are spun to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Two decades ago, pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that only had two mobile parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">A long ago, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanicest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges, and cross-sections, no further pitch or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the inside live very much, so it can fly stable, and moving in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right if all of you watch is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the exterior ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines will be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you are building them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="459">The bigger number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes converged in a very far distant galaxy are two black holes to each other and faster, they walked so the mass of three probes in a tenthesis in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they enlightened brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they don't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed over into space-time frame, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="476">About 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a growing life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God bless us - even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss is decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the CalTech -- to look for gravitational waves caused by black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses, so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser-interferometry Gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo was significantly enhanced, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">Early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational wave of the two collious black holes carried through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this what I had worked, is no longer Science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravity of black holes and their observatory such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves for 23 years?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravity of gravity is a tilting of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">In passing the shaft the space and its overall content are stretched in one direction and the other hand gested.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative theory, lecturers in courses for relativity theory often result in a really soft dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one was stretched out and gested in the wake of the waves. the expansion of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo-staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's absurd, it would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear strike. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "technical difficulties in building such detectors are massive." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are finalist and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles are overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things by taking that of several points to perceive the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At potns this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to specific properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them any simple pictures of objects in All.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by mind changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally listen to all.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulate simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very quickly, you hear the same circulating with an additional toner change. that sounds like: Wu-wu, wu wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender the sound] Someone who knows what he must hear, know this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass that turn around as fast as the staves of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what it means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the thightly body in all, one with a mass of 29 teeth, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each other a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to study the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can't see -- convenient or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mwater spoke stars in super novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes are happening in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since this opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves permeate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen all things we will never see, and of whom we have never seen. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo was in the first attempt to see things which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that contain black holes, as Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the barrier for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different perspective on the events in All, on the origin of the stars and ultimately, as we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a completely new generation of observatory on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether I was nervous to put me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on television live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly that I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that my life deeply changed, unexpectedly. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" "" "estimony" "", "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"swears, I need milk for my cabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the leap. and I said," "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"" "a new setting in my family. from then on, I stopped to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time." ""</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am doing very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a stunning side effect: I was actually completely understood that" "" "yes" "" "I saved my career to play with my children." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things off, revive you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every programme offers hundreds of jobs that never existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of nine days four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 different languages in 67 different languages.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obsolete. I must find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires, around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it, because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"" "" "" "I say to you, that all of you, who work so hard if you speak a company like a company or a classroom to take me serious, so that I'm not just doing my computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that it does not work at a dream job." ""</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, when I painted a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream you dream a high tone, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and unsettling, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sound like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume if I explain the sums that I write about it, that writing me will delight me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work with the TV production, when I began to work and work to create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this power, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't aim differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to be able to aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for the failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear answer: the more successful I become, the more episodes the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work at the same time, the more I watch history, the more I write story, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">What did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the tall clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, revamped, exaggerated, overrun.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that her mum is a single work place.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mama will not be there but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "swears, I want to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby supplies.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same titanium work, 15 hours day, performed weekends, no repentance, nothing delegate, a titanium is not working, a titanium does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just didn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summa and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if this is what you do, the work you love, suddenly verbose?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul you out, stupid maker-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you're doing what you are doing to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and know how to feel the sums when you stop the Summa if you stop the sum, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I like?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart listen, can I survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress poses me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to anything and second, she called me not "estimony."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "swears."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm playing Titan and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of sums, I cannot do anything except to stop.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">"" "everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes down, or whatever the girl in" "" "The Kingdoms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't immediately happen, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "if I ask you who you are if I'm telling you who I'm using shows and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is." ""</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not power and it is not labour-specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the printing of history, which are experiencing reperceptive tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I rule this rule, so that I can release myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not for me playing just how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth doesn't hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a man works better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm a relaxed one, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We swivel around in the garden, and back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are mashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always mature according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! then they always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve, for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they think they want something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybug or cookie will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year." ""</seg>

<seg id="752">Everyone can put 15 minutes at the same time, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the same time!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no linen, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my benefactors, my world. they don't have to be children. it is true to feel the sums, a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with his own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">In general, to play "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I am thwarted and I am going to make friends, reading books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to surpass through myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why don't allow yourself to treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The hum came back in my spare time. sums seems to return, if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works do not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, she fulfils me and my soul. I will lead me into new ideas. I use it into full turns and I love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums are not i... no more.</seg>

<seg id="778">It's schnuppe that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more play.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neuchirurgen, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have lasting, heavy disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have one of the most well known, the "lowenhirnstimulation." they implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neuchirurgen is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">The brain can help themselves with something help.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior doctor and worked in a recording day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with brain brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is willingly vulnerable to brain traumata and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, one must decrease the cranium pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes you need to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a tissue piece, comparable to small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, it abolished Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know still out of the biology class that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They sat down slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells closely as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark colourfully in order to be able to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planted it on the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we will plore these cells into normal brain tissue or what will happen when we use the same cells in damaged brain tissue.</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and so enforced exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been plantized.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that show them are these little points. these are the cells we cultivate in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained no wise monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of skill levels, we passed the motor motic in motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move her hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in people, they recover spontaneously until a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys that will recover spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we see the cells, the same monkey, two months after the matory plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani:" "" "Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must complete about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to see how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">One has to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select the patients to do treatments and rate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West do make a big mistake, as of course, to consider.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "we do not see democracy as the fragile plant which is in reality but as an inventory of our society." ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable awareness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That's not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large descendants in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Actually democracy is waning with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends that would repeat that democracy would change if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of misbelief, we could save democracy, but that we need a trusive and helpless democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are wasted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">With a waste of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently our economies are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"" "" "" "a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts long shadows on the U.S., Europe and the whole world." ""</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which may be anxious to invest there, but it could be too frightened where it would be productive and incomes, with whom you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humankind is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely did nothing but cast out the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds to intensify the pessimism of investors in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low demand advocate that it could not invest in which they could not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who could not be true, that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted, the circumstances bring about, that may cause oil to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hate with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely blaternal art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are key to the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a company form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed to many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course, slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce significance of the Athenian democracy because of these clasps.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the workers" "" "freedom of expression" "", "and not only the right to freedom of expression, but was more important and crucial to them, with equal voting rights in matters of state belongings." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democratic democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came first, as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy was the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our today's democracies since the time in which the separation of politics and the economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually hithered and destroyed." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not want to be so earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics within the economy is outwardly and the areas are separate." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in such a way a herd of prey, which nourished the animals, from which it feeds themselves, that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "similar to the economy, which has been so far cannibalised by the self-caused economic crisis itself, and the power of corporations is growing, political goods are decreasing, and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism, the" "" "demos" "" "of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour force and the prosperity of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to put together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "keeps control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the labour-working arms can only achieve a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low formaldehyde levels through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we have to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we establish the reunited area, otherwise we end in a disease monitoring hyperautocratie, which lets the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to" "" "matrix" "", "similar to that in" "" "Matrix Trek" "", "in which the machines are serving people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians," "" "Agora" "", "in long conversations the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" novel utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you some examples, shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: imagine a capital market in which you have money, while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next, and the company -- doesn't matter in which you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income from capital and revenues come from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">"" "" "" "no distinction between those who work, but not in it, and employees working there, but the company does not belong to them. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and couples, and ultimately no emptied twin tops." ""</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued from the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos," "" "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and every government pays the sum of which the trade deficit is equivalent to a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment resources are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have, especially in the background of a reunified Politics and Economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberally in whom it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink into a "Matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we will decide political together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertary Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for unification of politics and business is... do we not do this, the technological development will create a massive decline in global demand," "" "said Larry Summers as" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we see it, it will not only destabilize only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is absolutely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and that's why I am also completely unravaged.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who mentioned that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there's a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the world plays, -- the area of business -- a wholly-democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch now in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells massive to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I felt that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to the self-complacency and the permanent disdenying that the eurozone is massive and continues to continue with the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was revealed to denial this denial --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone have chosen the denial within the euro area." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system, which is not viable to get to life through political will and authoritarianism, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, claiming that he has no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the debt recovery program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the creditors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government only because they didn't want to deal with the distortion caused by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika's monetary policy imposed on us this policy, confessed:" "" "this was a colossant mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>

<seg id="1038">From Roy Price, most of them never heard, even though he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an ionic and describes itself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and contents to make Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right at this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the altitude shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated 9 and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "where, after having looked a squadron, your brain asks:" "" "where are there any more from these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left hand side, here at this end, shows are like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the turn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't matter to get on the left side of the turn, because I think you have special intelligence, to "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle outing, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not excited.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives you stuff for free, one gets really accessing, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watched when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you paused, which parts you are skipped or check once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process these and hence the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. Senators" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- a little over the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time in another company, another manager has plazed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy, he is always looking for a super show and he uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team watched the existing data about the Netflix audience, i.e. the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like the producer, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had joined all the parts they went on a car and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic seems somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision which you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so it is a bit scary because we live in a time we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"" "" "" "if one asks here in the US and for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company will be used to determine if a release is done or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison is worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data sealed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google doesn't make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way can predict -- through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success was culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the release of the publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors the data flow in decisions of life - in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computerized genetics -- an area in which some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"" "" "" "or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated." ""</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do not work two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disintegrate this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, the single parts put together in order to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: cut apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience, which otherwise they wouldn't have been able to put together all these parts, and make it a show like" "" "House of Cards" "", "that did not stand in the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions as they competed by TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic "" "" Magic 8 Ball "" "." it is astounding. for decisions using a "" "" Ja- or No-question "" "," you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" most likely "" "" -- here at this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will take it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I've met some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is clave and clave. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I think this is very encouraging message that, despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks to go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, there is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
