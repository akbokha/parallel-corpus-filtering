Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ tic tank , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not currently available .
this knows everybody who had to get an exciting day because the car @-@ Nav@@ i takes place a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offering of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are everything other than currently - but is therefore very in@@ sight@@ ful .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it is clear how cities and mun@@ icipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered , which you can &apos;t recognize it as such .
in the larger map , for cities and mun@@ icipalities were more detailed maps , so called ur@@ anium leaves .
these were made according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing government between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and of the first survey@@ ing in Bavaria .
your Principal : Napoleon .
Bavaria was occupied with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War .
Napoleon proposed an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops with@@ drew from Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 : there were the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide state of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the certificate for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison is early / today , the capital is most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the signing , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was created 21 years after the map creation , i.e. 1877 , a local district in Munich .
today , he is located in the middle of the city .
the houses are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : a small @-@ piece map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers out of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pri@@ st@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; little par@@ c@@ els show no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of the under@@ w@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 shows the October 19th century , was actually a meadow , and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar there is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße there were once people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was in 1858 @-@ 59 the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard led by G@@ ud@@ den the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who employs an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients first place was place , later it was extended to 500 positions .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth house with vocational training facilities .
west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential houses dating back to the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built in architectural shape at the origins of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the department store was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the allies of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a se@@ men from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Union for promoting Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colored people who travel to mis@@ criminal policies and ra@@ cial attacks by state to Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who should enter into force on August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to be aware of their first attention , since a number of frag@@ ile , ra@@ cial courts recently occur in the entire state and here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have suffered injuries of the citizens &apos; rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped and killed because of their skin colour , they are killed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear dis@@ comfort in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the Group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist fights against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died under the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state , and was accused by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without being accused of crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also indicates a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers will be more common than wh@@ ites in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring to bring money , or relatives who travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 % of the FBI in 2015 , following the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI to share the state in terms of the number of injuries on the 16th rank of the country .
the itiner@@ ary is also a reply to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to complain about a company for living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States had adopted immigration authorities to asser@@ t people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to other rac@@ en@@ pro@@ filed under the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stak@@ eholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ ght@@ aun@@ ching Project is elementary
the fishing club Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU , Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac bought a picture in front of the place .
the representatives of the fishing village of Schwen@@ demann met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann ex@@ ert some insights into its operation in which he houses 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young animals , and in five apartments of land houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative trading way for the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ a , only regional .
since he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ eb@@ bach , he identified the &quot; elementary project &quot; as elementary . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep faces .
the green past@@ oral care for a lot of work , much must be processed using the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and the top@@ ography to fight , &quot; empha@@ sized Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ic@@ uous operation and management this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the cycle project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and reas@@ oning about how they bring their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013 .
the dis@@ closure of this area amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be en@@ forced until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half over leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of fishing .
in this way , the farmers stay at 12 610 euros , which they had to invest at 16.@@ 2 kilometers in Wei@@ z@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared ji@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Peter Weiß : &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot;
the state railway line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state mining of women .
the goal is the holding of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
a pre@@ mise is the presence of a funding marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be tra@@ il@@ per@@ ated ( slope over 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots currently runs for the fishing industry in 2018 , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost of more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully produced fall of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took up a symbolic argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN on the proposals of the president to dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ ters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have promp@@ ted him if he had done it .
but he grab@@ bed their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem , which you refer to , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is proper properly , but how he form@@ ulated it , isn &apos;t it really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ or@@ tions of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the wor@@ m@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your troubles , your poor , / your ad@@ versaries , who longed to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not participate in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ umps are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural analysis : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had an extremely political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by showing them in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself is a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to switch back from the right wing this long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the great writer Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tizer for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty may not invite anybody , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ fold , who bring the American flame into the Umb@@ rian world : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not glow the way into the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they had been exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships has been seen .
it is in true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear .
and this is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black Pra@@ ise for Scottish Members of the United Kingdom
Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of world champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will contribute a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance while Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected from the team to the team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ dh is quite modest .
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that Ei@@ li@@ dh naturally brought up naturally were great . &quot;
the Com@@ monwealth @-@ Silver Medal is to compete in the fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sh@@ ot@@ tos in the British crew are .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , who were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the tre@@ ach@@ ers Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will participate to the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman , one after a great season , who was watching the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the teams &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only a team , but in some cases will be among the medals and among the Finn@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special to be team captain that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose to make me something special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , which belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech regarded as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup .
so it is really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking criticism from critics : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot reject the fuel from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of the interior policy up to his political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ed at the cr@@ iti@@ que , for sure .
but he did not provo@@ ke his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mute , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan expected to work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and er@@ ased their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this very beginning this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bar of the Governor dismissed the law@@ suit as free@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of an oppos@@ ing reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest acceptance of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playful his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy at his side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the blocking of persons coming up on the Governor - which is officially called public &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public forum &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is officially called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse said the actions of the Governor and argu@@ ed that blocking comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or sp@@ lash or h@@ asser@@ tive people that vibr@@ ate online .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ ogan .
and they are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no tro@@ ll .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ opped , but she asked to vom@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to har@@ ass@@ ment and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , even if a number of people takes position on the same subject , then they are regarded as a more so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the staff members of the Govern@@ ors described as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in early days , if you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn or destroy protest@@ ers and silence .
but exactly that happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public official who has critic@@ ized that he has ch@@ imp@@ acted Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ est@@ ones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , Alexandria , when they appointed a v@@ oter from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at present Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous post@@ p@@ ens beat on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , overcome his post , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hoping for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organis@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost the last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , was linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament message in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rapha@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game , and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I had won it from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon who win last year here .

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades less people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are coming to this result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Mu@@ gs .
in comparison , he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ holders are proved to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reason@@ ably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of household inclu@@ sions , the situation is more complicated than expected , as in the underground mountain range , which is not in the plans .
the traffic , which has always been hin@@ dered over the construction work , represents a big problem for the structural work of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers before red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the bus buses are entitled to access .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were pretty tough .
but fortunately we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner they don &apos;t use a stove .
they even use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the In@@ tran@@ quil Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the knot@@ ted c@@ olle is removed with di@@ li@@ gently , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also conduc@@ ts her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband there were no fields assigned .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink it , and there is the soldiers .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the hig@@ hl@@ ands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turning quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ u@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , is composed of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo , and from corrug@@ ated roofs that were converted into different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans conf@@ essed a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to be only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s most p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort dismant@@ led gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources in the value of estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military preser@@ ves an initial presence .
a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150.000 US dollars a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands are threat@@ ening these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
the massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal chie@@ v@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were considered to be genocide by the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All Comp@@ iling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , in the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
bolts are reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , because Muslim economies of mig@@ ra@@ ids come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning cant@@ ons sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people are strug@@ gling to stay here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native native to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the vern@@ ac@@ ular and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and lit@@ ig@@ ation in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep freezer for two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke down in the dark .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a c@@ lash in their tone , and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , struck the group with their ri@@ bs , told sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was defeated so hard that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things reported on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried native hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing along - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to tow stones on police and military post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said to be released in an official document by TIM@@ E that has not been released to the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E , on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ak still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness to the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ ane said how many Indones@@ ians wearing only one name , the TIM@@ E says in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threat@@ ens to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the k@@ illings came first day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced mi@@ ath@@ ies for the families of victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical abuse in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he will direct an extra@@ judicial mechanism for set of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E on 5 June and said that he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who had been accused of crimes against humanity for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with fierce unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I &apos;ve been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , fear being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten up by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting were stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ha@@ ma , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person died , and 17 others were injured , among them also children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by dam@@ aging warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was in close proximity to the hospital and was witness as the injured one has been delivered very quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have been hiding two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has inv@@ oked to withdraw the officers and withdraw the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ resting place for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green hig@@ hl@@ ands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pushing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den@@ Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never wake up again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest@@ ing for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a are only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants in the course of the opening of new flight passengers to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers .
the few jobs , which are in the region , go to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns were to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ conscious provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pac@@ ific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of State Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r told the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to disgu@@ ise the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on site want to consider that more foreign governments should consider this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the leadership of Human Rights , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , on May 4 , visited their silence and ad@@ versaries . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but anon@@ ym@@ ously .
Indonesia announced another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua would probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a military military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ baum brought a final symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried on the grounds opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they did not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the tower for only two years , it is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; a resident told his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Ci@@ vic Repres@@ ent@@ ators said that the units of fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) cleared the fire and the building was cool .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
the incident may be used to ensure safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of boards for isolation and facing at the London Gren@@ head Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with approximately 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis @-@ Cup ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by the General Davis Cup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single , was only supported on two winning no@@ zzles , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although very long , it is also very long , but also very estimated five set classics remain the same to the traditional compet@@ itor .
according to the reform of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted to reform the target of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ographic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for the vote , after many claims , before the proposal came to carry out the final on a neutral location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training places will be facil@@ itated and players will have to complete the Davis Cup higher official media event .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings forbidden items into the plane , finding a survey
a survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately failed or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items in the control points of the US Transportation Security administration , including at least 6 percent , which carried the aircraft while acci@@ dentally forbidden kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed , they would have discovered that they were irr@@ ational with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also realized that younger trav@@ ellers don &apos;t reject the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they have attempted to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X .
the most common items related to T@@ SA agents were deliber@@ ately tow@@ ed , foods and fluids were processed .
more than 3 percent reported to have committed objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately forbidden drugs to the plane .
the company said it had question@@ ed travelers in the whole country to figure out how many were acci@@ dentally brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware by plane safety and how many things were deliber@@ ately done .
it is no surprise that people who wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - by the safety , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain which fluids can take them or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items prohibited by T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a while , the people thought T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ clients Order Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are fond of the huge number of pre@@ ferences for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so far , he has signed up to date , a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k also betra@@ yed another , less g@@ lowing number in the announcement of recent quarters of the recent quarters : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months Mus@@ k often advert@@ ised with more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now , Mus@@ k dre@@ amt about : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ .000 pre@@ orders , 63@@ .000 had already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always pointed out that it merely deals with no obligation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla pay the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserves &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are provided with analysts at a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders could be the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production side .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 it will be - all models have been assembled - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may count on delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand new , yet never tested in practice with maximum capacity uti@@ lization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if any delays cause any delays , the in@@ scri@@ be of the reservations should be a Tesla problem .
because then the company can &apos;t prevent un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA @-@ chief P@@ ru@@ itt draws himself back because of the hes@@ itation of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had to delay its earlier decision , to reduce the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused by air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of State Environment authorities across action faster than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint which was filed against his previous post in a federal court .
it is a deadline , which ran down on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 Oz@@ on earth level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to study his authority over time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Prosecutor of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable enemy tou@@ g@@ her environmental legislation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ ke has repeatedly passed to block regulation or del@@ aying the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal has decided that the EPA manager has exceeded its authority , as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks to delay .
in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that the turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards just hit the read@@ iness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the states through the complex process of correc@@ ting the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former devast@@ ation , EPA often has the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be indicted and tried by activists and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ rau@@ ded the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t believe in regulation by court proceedings and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the position of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt would use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans push for a more comprehensive re @-@ revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill in the last month approved legislative design will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been voted to vote in the Senate .
in New York , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the United States Coalition , said the EPA in this week said that the Group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our pl@@ agues - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans , who flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tail@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York settled in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems in sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of public health and environmental protection che@@ ered on lease of surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing , how much pressure it needs to in@@ hale this reasonable step by the responsible for protecting the air that we in@@ hale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental contamination and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a master who built a church , and took home with a priest , remained in the owner of this church and could also inherit it .
this was the right to put a priest , or to propose the Bishop a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .

club wants to test permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned towards the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) is asked to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in four@@ score only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a Wind@@ force concentration zone has existed .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier by a change in the area of wind to a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which was not approved by the Düsseldorf District Government in Düsseldorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of scheduled legal requirements , the granted approval is not lawful and thus to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Columbus , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council decided once again the wind con@@ centric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval from the District Government is still out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a cold : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this point , the division of an approval for the construction of wind turbines is not legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle confirms the entrance of the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective letters have been received for last week at the district square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit takes it to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they are not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view on the ongoing trial at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle of Thursday did not want to express content in terms of the argument of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four ( 200 meters high wind turbines ) .
already last year , the company had been involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen is medi@@ cally involved , with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large territory closed .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households will be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity consumption of all four households .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , the green light gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen as well as an participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

city and dealers plan &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
the area of Bad Langen@@ des@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to be re@@ discovered in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration plan to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the residents to shopping shopping in downtown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like the chairman of the commercial , Christian king , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend will sens@@ it@@ ise the customers to sens@@ it@@ ise their own city away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is therefore a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekly market .
the companies should also present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ night @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion is not only for residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are available on the radio , internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal Administration and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the business club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ction City . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as selling Sunday , talks with all commercial operators and host to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the loading of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential will also be new or re@@ opened .
for this purpose , visitors and tourists belong .
but also many locals had lost sight of the city shopping .
in the end , all would have to contribute to bel@@ li@@ fy the city - to land@@ lords , factories all over the city and clubs .
it was to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y network with a network that was partly wider , king in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , divided the third of five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns a third , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tag should advert@@ ise the value of local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can influence its own direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump translated tran@@ scription from phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary walls
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , calling to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President imp@@ acted him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first attempt with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees to take over to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ban refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said to Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massac@@ res : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury came across a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge from Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ lying - a man @-@ middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
indo@@ ors the in@@ mates suspended in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; co@@ cked the man .
&quot; get it from the car ! &quot;
cry out the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only one post@@ ing .
but when a sn@@ are is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them had real sigh@@ s in the audience .
since 2005 , civil liber@@ ators come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were made by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really un@@ search@@ able that in all these years , no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who assi@@ sts in the organization &apos;s organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman member of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil servant .
for him , the post@@ ing is regarded as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that it has never been corrected wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want healing , we want to be reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court @-@ medi@@ ator put a towel on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI documents , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ ism .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the dual motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made its vote for the first time in Georgia to vote for their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time , according to the FBI , by the FBI , by the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , allegedly down during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our had been in the city , that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white farm owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they approached the prison and drew near to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the k@@ illings , &quot; conclu@@ des an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local pro@@ secu@@ tions , which was not only involved in the killing of evidence , provided evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more glorious .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you sign up , and if you vote , it will happen to you here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post@@ ing of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illustr@@ ative , moving , and is founded in a sort of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believed that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are then confronted with its ugly face in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors were th@@ ron@@ ged - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and heard , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief Cl@@ an@@ mit@@ es since years , but he said that the role will never be simpler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester and urged him to get angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a bl@@ aze the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely because the energy is postpon@@ ed in the space , a feeling of camera will replace the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is beginning again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , nuts and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , clothed with sack@@ cloth , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actors and carries billi@@ on@@ ful holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
approximately one hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen people of sweat and tears in his eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced all about eight hours of Georgia , when Broo@@ ks le@@ ys her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you were on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels ho@@ stly .
if the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ ve on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy when he wants to remember .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe out her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ ges Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the cl@@ an@@ ly .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a surro@@ unds two of his players and then breaks down in her arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience put together with the actors for dinner .
on a table chat@@ ted a white pair from Atlanta ti@@ pped over the night with a black pair , which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ insky therefore strug@@ gled to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... of people coming as you yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is really doing with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ x will still continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ing is inspiring in a certain way , because she describes the horror of what we end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf speci@@ alizes in a colourful , six @-@ story scenery .
the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ ed street corner with mas@@ on@@ ward and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
previously , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine is po@@ i@@ ded as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks reminis@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - which draws through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine seal - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the Rhein@@ gold .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderful Hagen that surro@@ unds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
the scene is brutal to the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who gets humble and bowed down his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the festival orchestra which will be on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in a longer leisure time .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his partner team had been expected .
in 2013 he had to let down a ball@@ point concert for himself in 2013 , there were five years later great jewel@@ s in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were sub@@ merged .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to be pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of his vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt , at once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven , the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , a late professional volunteer .
how is this coming ?
quantity : I did a high school .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that it is wrong for me and I want to make something different with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I wondered what you &apos;re doing .
make a social year , there is an insight where you can see how it is on @-@ site , in the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it like that ?
I have collected great impressions .
I am going to start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual , possibly at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not a bit unusual during the volunteer &apos;s service to have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make his FS@@ J .
it can be from aging to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the after@@ care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could realise my own strengths and see how it is really running .
unlike in engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to calculate st@@ ati@@ ques .
one always has other people in front of the head , which each have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been made up of the family - you must always be individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservation ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a range that gives you a lot .
lots of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
P@@ ear@@ son al@@ ps more 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ear@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British Education group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said on Friday , she will cut another 3,000 work@@ places and will cut its intermediate @-@ divi@@ ding by 72 percent , since another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the job mining , Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly employed for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4.000 jobs .
P@@ ear@@ son announced in May in a third cost programme for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a shop that was hit by a fast step towards digital learning .
the company , who sold his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy Attack by Kabul : NATO Sol@@ dier killed in suicide bom@@ ber
a suicide bom@@ bed has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing a soldier of Nato and killed several others .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured , he shared an explanation of Nato .
according to the reported local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing of Afghanistan is the last violence that took place in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion on Thursday night was to happen when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan Army has been attacked by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised spr@@ inkl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement says that all injured in a stable state and in the U.S. military hospital are covered on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ om@@ ance killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban claimed they would have done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since US military forces joined the Taliban in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the pre@@ dominant security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to support the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ates in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay regul@@ ating the government of Obama , to which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ rau@@ ded the agency because of the step@@ per . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it will show the obligation of the agency to work together with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA @-@ chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to specify the o@@ zone provisions - in which in part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured , where inc@@ isions have to be made to avoid more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mainly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint upon Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental impact , who has imposed the ex @-@ president Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which should stim@@ ulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the impact of democr@@ ats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website states that the inhal@@ ation of air that o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and rein@@ force respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ ites , the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ war@@ ts decided to set up a common room in the future home population .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will still take until the church community belonged to the church , but there is no planning event for the project coming from a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space available for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the community are pending before such a common room cannot be seen as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ atory residence but openly to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided in the last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a common room would be T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 per cent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision to indicate that it does not want to signal the investor , that in this regard , we do not throw b@@ ill@@ ets down between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the rise height and the construction of economic power - that would be possible .
need@@ less , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the panel .
it is not as easy as common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela call refers to the many own buildings with whom you don &apos;t get so right now , but now in the common room from the window , they say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do it hard with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger certainly speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it looks behind a hidden maximinum payout of So@@ vereig@@ nty , or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface , I don &apos;t give a supplement , but get a real , in doubt , in doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal , to set orders accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two oppos@@ ites in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step forward to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : cyclists turns on road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cyclist was caught up by car in Gar@@ ath by car and severely injured .
like the police in the middle , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ feld was on the way around 12.@@ 20 clock with his bike on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den .
the Senior wants to cross the road@@ way in the amount of the road on the Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction of driving car driver granted him priority .
but as the Langen@@ fields drove on the road , he was obviously not evident to the traffic .
he joined by a car , which tax@@ ed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was shot on the road .
he suffered severe injury and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ tu@@ ce .

for five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti did responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , &quot; said : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
the last was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hiking in the resin from star to star
in Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; star path &quot; is to be created .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the needs of many har@@ p visits , named it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well att@@ ain@@ able installations to five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drop in question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brown pad , high quality and sie@@ ve .
the information on the tablets will be supple@@ mented via the Internet .
that is why the site selection plays a good mobile network reception .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad Zug should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer tells a lot of worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , although he is much further away .
I am also convey@@ ed in which constellation can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running since 2014 at the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest level in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Har@@ z National Park , it is part of the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way galaxy and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy is clearly visible with naked eye .
since 2003 there is something similar to the planet@@ arium &apos;s initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
beginning in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exact 75 meters away the sun stands at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is four kilometres .
while the light from sun up to Plu@@ to is needed about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour until st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the universe .
the march came to the next fix@@ ation but would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down

Garcia stretching the right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his gir@@ dle against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00 on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is &apos;s climate noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magn@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember@@ ing Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to pull down light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed to .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate conference asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , a part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their light @-@ weight campaign in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could be held in Pay @-@ by @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia Garcia and pressed themselves openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia Lom@@ ach@@ enko as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held his praise for Garcia in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity Champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted me to be co @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes .
they both said they could sense the momentum that built himself for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four last to tire plat@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously wounded during an accident on the A7 .
following the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost around 16.@@ 30 shortly before the end of the market , presumably after a tyre plat@@ ter , control over its vehicle .
the passenger car tow@@ ed to the squ@@ ash , where he over@@ threw himself and remained on the roof in the tren@@ ch .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service , A7 toward the north was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic was passed on the left stre@@ ak on the left side of the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ aming Chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er against Braunschweig , that the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ensive formation takes place in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , wouldn &apos;t have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the tri@@ f@@ chain is to be further optim@@ ised .
and a gate after a fre@@ eb@@ le would no longer want to catch up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no one in addition to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is even better in preparation with the rotating chain , than with the four@@ score .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is for sure , &quot; because we just have in the Dre@@ aming Chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we do not afford such a lot of game mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also runs to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can &apos;t talk after an accident from a mis@@ leading start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can focus on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to focus on the cup of season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start in the season I was only after six to eight players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage against Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony had to be broken early due to a crash . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and full game like Fort@@ una for a ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defense of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests are coming from the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ shit , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew in the second league which you have to beat about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s coach coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , everyone believes in the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( G@@ osp@@ ts@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the tests conducted in the past year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum proceedings , after the Swedish migration Agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ational verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for lack of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ent .
up to now , Mig@@ r@@ ational sales sends 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency told that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a huge difference in statistics of the past months , figures are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the underground person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ adet the 5@@ 81 published results , she pointed out that in 243 of these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , which are made in X @-@ rays of we@@ ds teeth and MRI shots of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska institute , whose work includes the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if they were used earlier or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say , we should not do this as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is minor .
the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , head manager at the Department of road and traffic in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is assured that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault Bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning at the northern side of a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called br@@ ittle f@@ lap .
this is an edge version , which is also used as an operating way .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge can be used on Friday .
on this then the pedestrian walk@@ way will go .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented fr@@ oth arms .
a special finger@@ print experience has the laying of pipes by the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
for there , a glass fibre cable runs where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project prior to work by hand@@ ler .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish need to be f@@ ished first .
for bridges between the farm buildings and the gathering branches in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the road in the area of the bridge is locked at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of three frac@@ tures amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties can move on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties represented in the cra@@ yon of volcanic erup@@ ted parties ( CDU , SPD , genetically , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that this day shows peac@@ efully on this day because the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites to a poster for &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ lands formed the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24th , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site already hours before the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
originally , the city &apos;s picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the sight of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture , which offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ian potato sal@@ at that could also eat the AF@@ D problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police found many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the AF@@ D volcanic erup@@ tion in order to try such an event and get a supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking forward to the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle of several speakers , among them the rh@@ einf@@ o @-@ pf@@ cent@@ ered AF@@ D leader Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers that are waiting for the leaders of the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to hold their speech@@ es .
the police presence unchanged , but so far the officials had a calm evening .
the AF@@ D event takes some more than an hour . the AF@@ D event , guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but also there is a little while after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can rest - no special inci@@ dents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European leading orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the lust , not only to cross the limits to their instrument , but also merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart was quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ality .
&quot; when I bite to grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette woman with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with anyone who I had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe me , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten was thinking that it was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I &apos;ve never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but especially among them I suffered according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time when she was like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and damaged .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to find yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and you may call me some un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify it from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in cheers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement in the West Virginia Rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal store from his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from doing our country again great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ance and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is not able to find a positive , pur@@ ifying message &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ our@@ able &quot; Russian sorry for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have carved gold and silver medal at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ supported d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e said rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation experienced himself , and everything possible , to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress will support the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ones from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the Athletics World Championships , who begin Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the mission of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
gent@@ es are still in@@ adequate and forbidden coach are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for a tragedy down in Mali
in a fun@@ eral celebration of the North H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1,000 people have thought about 1000 people from the helicop@@ ters in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
thus , Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two inver@@ ted pilot but as &quot; C@@ ade@@ ner of their trade . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest victim , which she provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ i@@ be@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .
her mothers were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral of Saint Peter .
at the south , only the members took leave in the Church .
after that , the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
of the mour@@ ns put on ro@@ ses , the members stood in arm in arm .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen marked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldier as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann was set up by the Tiger pilot Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his Regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , too , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have been wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts on the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , by which we are separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral party , the coff@@ ins were taken from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not take any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants to leave no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife next to his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already has a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , she said in her news .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a h@@ eh@@ l from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king .
in 2016 he retired and sets the title &quot; Prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
because Hen@@ rik won &apos;t have the title and function that he wanted to see , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the chief of the Danish royal family .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country , for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Order , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the subject he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy of the people always flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state of his almost 50 years of re@@ union with the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik above the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did , critic@@ ized .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and the others had the call to be the brand of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid change .
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , however , after the loss of red @-@ green government &apos;s majority , he does not want to reti@@ re .
he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
earlier , the surprise of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony had previously over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony .
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their short@@ cut a single @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
the CDU group Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction to record them .
thus the CDU and F@@ DP would have seats at 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on country , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country day is elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must decide whether she could go@@ vern a majority in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Weil considers it to be indispensable for the country &apos;s day as soon as its self @-@ resolution decides .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on her further advance on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state of state will also see the opportunity that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament chooses the trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be kept legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all the questions if they are not legally protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she was described as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the dis@@ tr@@ ing de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their land council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally anticip@@ ate that she has received their landing at the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the presi@@ ding Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Party of Anja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision from El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the background , that there was no substantial differences , we can &apos;t understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD law candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Trans@@ ition of the Lower Sax@@ on Green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of former Green de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly select the country day .
the exit of Western Australia costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests in the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty content play and tries to hit the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU / S &amp; D leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to absorb El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ WA@@ Y , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 country code .
the CDU was then the strongest force in the SPD , but SPD and Green had a very thin majority of a vote in the country .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect the consumer .
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editors Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Lord Schmidt , How can consumers protect the consumer from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states provide the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di does not assume the best possible emergency response - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal State Minister is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and is since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s concerned exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same way as the manufacturers ensure that the sold products are conveni@@ ently harmless and health .
when on eggs the resi@@ du@@ ci@@ bility content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the establ@@ ishments are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after such knowledge , production companies do not meet immediate debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal practices .
as always there is too little Controll@@ le@@ ure in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or also in the conclu@@ sive condition ?
however , the official controls , which have uncovered the operation .
however , the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consequ@@ ential education and hand@@ over to the government agencies in the cases , in which off@@ ences may be pre@@ dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made several times significantly , that I expect from the responsible authorities a complete recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food industry ?
consumers &quot; consumers have the right to get to secure and secure food exclusively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by ar@@ ming means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers fall into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ powered animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it has to consistently work on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is moment@@ ary and flaw@@ less .

any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that have been called by the UEFA Cup in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to $ ten million per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money loose with security , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar sign and bring him into a galaxy to other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publishers may deal much money for the purchase of players , but must deal with legitim@@ ate input sources , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that they had taken enormous debts in their quest to success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked their support when banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini came from the Presidency of the Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to put away from excessive expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , faced with The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it may distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the resolution can be indicated for the next five years at the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
the PS@@ G was reduced to € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players rather than normal 25 players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to rev@@ ise their financial supervision by raising their income by company that are associated with owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market additions , the UEFA would not apply to legitim@@ ate income . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA of Qatar was delayed by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar may come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambassador will be to find out and just find such man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regul@@ ators .
the former sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA Cup will be more attentive to respect each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no previous talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the recent reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ship De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated one of the best football players to see , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ner by claim@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finance d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s last owner on PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ore supplier
in recent years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the shots began in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ signs the job .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rupt@@ cy confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA in the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we &apos;re very happy with the current suppliers Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
about 17 million small red and white packed Sch@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ eln divided up to 14 grams a year before landing at the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to worry about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry sider appreci@@ ates the volume volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs , with an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ ate manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many applicants are there on the new call , the Swiss will not betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the Spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate producer did not reach a statement .
chocolate bars have distributed Swiss flights since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss made a half a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
in long @-@ h@@ aul flights , customers of First Class with treats of le@@ fts are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class B@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympic champion Robert Hart@@ ing reached World Cup final
the three @-@ time world champion is fighting a medal on Saturday in the final .
his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , has failed in the national world championship break and could only look at the tri@@ b@@ une competition .
with the first attempt , the Polish title def@@ ender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski was qualified , who threw the 6@@ 5,@@ 13 meters , for the final battle .
nost@@ al@@ gia is in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge era , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to major things .
as a cultural fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ enabled era via permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like that the time would scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd rot@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking can vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ ff@@ ing up the core of the day - actors of middle ages play hor@@ ny children who grow up - still managed to win the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who now play adults is less emotional and his par@@ ody is more according to the wat@@ ering principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on one point , a character is created by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of other things in 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious Coo@@ p ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ tras are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ama sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are the moments acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat up this fran@@ chise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose latest scene is to show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the movie &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring combat icon .
the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created a com@@ edy TV show with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism , and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ sized Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be dub@@ bed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV as Americans might want to do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors , including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it is often used as a single .
for six long episodes it attracts , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was modified on a lower length , could deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef will always visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embassy for the imag@@ inary audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a gel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator did not exist wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ ood .
blow against Drugs Mafia in the Land
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched numerous objects such as the public pro@@ secutor in Constance on Friday .
there were 15 accused of being arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also asked large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects there was German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia was accused of drug crimin@@ ality , violent crimes , attempted murder , and black@@ mail .
for the summer of 2016 , the Pro@@ secution &apos;s Office for the organised drug traff@@ icking in the Southern German area has been determined .
between the government agencies in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big deployment on Wednesday mor@@ nings was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
to the visor of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly relate to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
even a incident occurred on 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the morning , would go to the band &apos;s account .
way compl@@ ains big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner tab
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner tab in Germany shows significant defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to the government management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a report according to big g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register took attention to a media report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies in the pre @-@ registered data could lead to serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures and deportation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis that lies in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people have been recorded with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 emig@@ rant authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data enco@@ res can significantly slow down @-@ processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics about travelling people , EU citizens are covered , which would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false al@@ ordin@@ ances led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate about dealing with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subject &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy , when they travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ der Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper therefore , the BAM@@ F provides such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually impossible , as the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following Dublin agreements , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the ministry now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy have given warranty for the recording and accommodation of families &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these additions .
other EU states also would send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political speaker of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threat@@ ens the terms of def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of people living in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , which were excellent on Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile distributed 100 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the church in the meeting of the council has multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is created for this and we spar@@ ate the don@@ ors of respect that their blood is available for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ signed may@@ ors Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Dep@@ th of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the con@@ serv@@ ees are disper@@ sed in their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donations .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions taken in the spring in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house was led to higher participants in a few years ago .
prior to that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ w@@ berry have been awarded to the multiple branches and were awarded for 50 .
half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave 500 milli@@ litre of their lives .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation would have aver@@ aged a rise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when she maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly financial report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.6 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the household income would continue to rise by almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary in the coming years to breed inflation and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package that was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time for financial plans to provide cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the real@@ ignment of households will continue to load consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ etus of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger extent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than the markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the bank also stressed that increases &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; unlimited &quot; would be made .
the Bank &apos;s down@@ lighted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast posted in May .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change will come after the latest dis@@ appointing growth numbers , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover according to the Bank &apos;s end of the year .
the recent inc@@ eption report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and minor increase in inflation , as the ti@@ gh@@ ing becomes even worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income from income in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages at the end of its three @-@ year period are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds , resulting in lower consumption expend@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is made a year after lo@@ wering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sl@@ ing of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will be fully reaching the prices and the economy .
prior to the final verdict of the Bank increased interest rates , the call increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on harsh households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July resulted in an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this would be expected to attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the transition in relation to their goal is 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to attribute pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of the s@@ wap rate , mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the credit@@ ors are looking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who complete the existing deals and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to en@@ act 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will get access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive treatment in September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse , pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of risk at risk @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by health service over a first three years study of estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld a judgment of the Supreme Court in the last year , after the N@@ HS had to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to be introduced to people , and other clinics will follow in October until it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission with inf@@ ect@@ ants .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate atten@@ de@@ es are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and register in a home physician , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medications in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to assess the whole potential of Pr@@ EP by taking clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of prolonged progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted and focused on vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to enhancing many , many lives .
we welcome you very warmly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be carried out that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now since the Pr@@ EP testing has been pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial is welcome and over@@ due for months of delay and delay .
evidence shows how transform@@ ative these drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this viable infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sought something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer to this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot has been over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ raum and a mezz@@ anine to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home not just a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne &apos;s life .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged for each other , without having to g@@ aps us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about building a simple platform , but to put steel so that it had the right height above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement has made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us desc@@ ends via the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection is like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the records and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is so special about this is that it is a gar@@ rison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a little engineering company went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is quite important , so it happens when you push the door , very easy gli@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improvement layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high quality materials that provide the room to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned into something quite amazing thanks to good design and increased s@@ oms .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers strug@@ gling for a 500 million US dollar estate market
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty in a meditation because of one of the biggest property imperi@@ alists Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as , worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has led him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and their assets are to be split .
Paul has wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation with the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 have accumulated in value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now covers offices in the city of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin - was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief operator and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s office and Paul about one @-@ third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court case says that Colin ownership is worth $ 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the essays by Colin proposed him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday after several failed plac@@ ements .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims to have ruled him out .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but throws Paul before , to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says he was hoping to settle the battle .
&quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held by law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s and in the early se@@ venti@@ es .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property , in which Colin the first je@@ an invite the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he started the high school when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company had paid € 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain and draw up our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps of new staff of staff is planning to restri@@ ct media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly is actually doing it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO reports that the new staff of staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first working day with senior employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps Bel@@ em &apos;s house , which he will repair : poor information that come into hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagn@@ osis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump , by super@@ v@@ ise its media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump relationship to television is back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate was upset because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of positions that were to convince him , &quot; said the former candidate consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IC@@ ICO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former presidential officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter custom was ever under control , &quot; ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these fight officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets could have even more explo@@ sives .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that does not send Tr@@ ump .
if his colleagues were creating it several times , trouble away from him , then their efforts have paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevent it from preventing b@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ers to dou@@ bt@@ ful information from strategic reasons .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he sti@@ ff@@ ly figure out whence they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a writing of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the source behind a pile of being &quot; Lec@@ tures &quot; at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed the wrong accus@@ ations in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump reading the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove more effective managers as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master wanted crimin@@ als get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of people pray and hoping for .
the police in all over Europe are shipped in this summer ( virtual ) postcards in dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of selected heavy crimin@@ als are not known , they will be hoping for prayer from the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting of holiday resorts have been hidden , named it by Europ@@ ol .
it has compiled a 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ell , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online hym@@ ns could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house@@ keeper of West Mid@@ lands are back with some of the trav@@ ellers on war@@ d@@ foot , who have drawn away from the municipality drawn by the church , in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field before their manor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of Transpor@@ ters , after being pulled out in May , without having been deported from a sc@@ rap@@ ing tren@@ ch to prevent their failures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles by a section called un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious residents urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous person said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council has to be forced into action by Sch@@ am , as he was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved and moved back .
more arrived last night , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to cope with it by long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am living on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to have to pay my com@@ unity if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of a camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents are an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the judgment must check when we place our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house from the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Birken@@ hof hotel by the former ambi@@ ence of the Birken@@ hof on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year passed and also income from local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees , which were offered in the county , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , which provided a controversial discussion .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted then in the Municipal Council .
but mainly Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and then spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer is acquired in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Mal@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing in front of the entrance time before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ rob@@ es from the rooms .
the hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large be@@ ac@@ able showers , the input area will be re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be called &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a gem . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment .
one wants to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated city level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , will be wide @-@ wide , explained Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Krau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to set out exactly .
he expects just under one million euros .
the outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is clearly visible .
a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Investig@@ ator lob@@ es Grand Jury
in the Russia affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in the past weeks , the Panel recorded the work , the Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal with the cause confi@@ ded persons .
the newspaper explained the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ c@@ aster CNN reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the board in connection with a meeting between s@@ umps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been completely bl@@ ended in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump Elec@@ tor Team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are aimed at the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tre@@ ad private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump was personally placed in the centre and investigate the accus@@ ation if the president possibly hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the underlying evidence in possible failure to decide whether the indictment should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called Count .
mostly they are turned on when there are larger and controversial cases .
the process is always covered behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public pro@@ secutor to charge persons to hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CNN transmitter , pre @-@ loading are already shown to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in the meetings were called to a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump advisor and law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his then Chief Executive Officer Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in conversation with the interview .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that it will show that Mu@@ eller should not inti@@ mi@@ date his work , and that he should be necessary quickly to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless the en@@ forcement of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president of the Thursday evening held a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the democr@@ ats a possibility of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he know@@ eth nothing of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special Agency on &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be determined against the President .
you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been employed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this root , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him about setting the investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure due to the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special investig@@ ator and his staff .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent special congress of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , by later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller had a position in which he could be fired on insist@@ ence on the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend one such step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put deb@@ tors on Thursday , after which the special det@@ rac@@ ers could not be released more so easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the Western Antarc@@ tica a gigantic ice@@ berg is solved by the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ se@@ men of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large col@@ os@@ ks drive to the north and will probably be two , three years until it melted .
it is equipped with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest polar giant , which have been registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people is not going out of him .
although climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice@@ berg , research is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , there have been a series of unusual co@@ bur@@ sts in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ simile background .
in opinion of many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
now the broken pist@@ on had been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is growing constantly on the sea and it breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this shadow , the equilibri@@ um of wa@@ xing and Canc@@ el was disturbed several years ago .
a complete shot is to be broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to do that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front edge I have never with@@ drawn so far as currently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the ice plate under tension and can be broken if an item is bre@@ wed on a key site .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg will not increase sea level , as they swim on the water and pushed the ice as much water as it produces after mer@@ ging itself .
however , the loss of the shadow leaves that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could perhaps increase sea level , but only in a small measure , writes the British research project about the observation of Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antarc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon , and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the start of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists it is argu@@ ed if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now grow back , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researchers did not withdraw this gigantic ice@@ berg in the climate change , so in recent decades , many polar bears of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula can dis@@ integrate .
this long finish in Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the area of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has grown by around three degrees in the past 50 years and counting them to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU wishes pets in the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy free places , the CDU , out of the working association calls to be more attractive .
first before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ al has 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the apprenti@@ ces in the circle are clearly very cov@@ eted .
there were about 620 applications for which to be registered in this year .
nevertheless , the circuit is still missing , to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ant spots in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers are searched for the general administration .
the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and entered the administration .
according to the desire of the parties , administration is to work a concept for personnel production and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to expos@@ e non @-@ short @-@ term Bed@@ ding to professionals , but to counter@@ act forward the application scar@@ city .
the overall concept should focus inside and extern@@ ally orient@@ ate concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and requires a graphic offensive , call the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
for the circuit has to do with staff problems , which one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities wer@@ ve good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees , causing disease or age @-@ condition@@ ally .
high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , head of the CDU , continues with his party beyond common application .
he sto@@ cked out already in the cra@@ yon day for a f@@ issu@@ ing surprise when he publicly presented the personnel cover publicly and the rest of the parties aston@@ ied .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which enable an exit from the municipal work association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come back to a satisfactory solution in the short term , it should aim with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a domestic tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the CDU , the employees and officials are trying to pay better than the tariff for public service is actually pre@@ valent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases and more money is only if you change in a higher level , which is oriented to vocational years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are responsible for the provisions of the new prost@@ itute Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin judges have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy intensi@@ fied the tone of NGO &apos;s life@@ jacket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs that use life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they do not continue to keep up new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs sign no new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minn@@ itis warnings came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; youth hi@@ kers &apos; because their crew had been working effectively with traff@@ ickers in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself to detailed accus@@ ations of the Italian state authorities Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can evaluate all the accus@@ ations that are currently ex@@ alted , after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities have supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ uns &apos; , supervised by I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that its occupation with ding@@ h@@ y migrants are on board , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Pro@@ state of State , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the occupation is suspected to susp@@ end the authority of the Italian coast @-@ guards , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly have an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and life@@ jacket , have so far been declared to keep on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but they wouldn &apos;t be acceptable to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their rescue transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of migrants who returned after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , causing the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with local citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ ers Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berliner Foreign Post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long and tourist attractions .
three included guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and wine of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ ong@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing layers .
in between there were always long asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ but@@ t did reward .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ z market .
again , look@@ out points to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of elev@@ ations were announced .

after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest of its best side - a sporty and cul@@ turally known .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga match for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in front of computer consoles , instead of having crossed the wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also recognized the first federal lig@@ ations which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , beginning in 2015 , followed the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train there is a lot of clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the Gam@@ ers will compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players in the meantime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must apart from the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that young people are still going into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you could be present in much more often on these markets as only once a year to send the German lig@@ aments to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
for e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA at competitions .
long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen have become well @-@ established where the pros are competing against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the concept is surely used to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic also has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ sport is a sport because it &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional Gam@@ ers should not only exercise on console but also train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ otic looks like problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult in online games , and in the scene is missing the structures of classical sports .
the scientist empha@@ sizes the highly integ@@ rative effects of E @-@ Sports .
the players are international traveling , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and big tournaments .
sales are expected to lie at 130 million in three years .
for the barely 2.4 billion Euro of the football league , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor .
International countries are already far@@ ther .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class of teaching , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league clubs according to D@@ utt is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nost@@ al@@ gia and clear up the old times , it is no longer sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time al@@ ign the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; the de@@ bu@@ n says .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy condem@@ ns suicide
a woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended in par@@ ole .
Carter was convicted of Conrad Roy in June because of the killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal agent argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream color bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the lawyer &apos;s lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance shown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible fact that she is completely de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental disease have had a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who says it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no day , I won &apos;t sei@@ ze the loss of my beloved Son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to be proud of me and how I &apos;m going with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity , for his sisters to be there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pro@@ secuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of his brother &apos;s wedding , or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person to have with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legitim@@ ate preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , to claim a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention to Car@@ ters Text@@ communications , that she encouraged him to stop her life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on , spring of a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent to his death in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All that you have to do is to do the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press by any press .
the case has dealt the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox was sentenced in 2007 because of murder on her British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup as captain .
the FC Bayern tr@@ usses the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation is not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which I saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra garment was very small , very small .
but because far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer to see himself , he divided himself to his arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer didn &apos;t have announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told her after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , it could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but K@@ imm@@ ich was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation experienced professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player guide , but he .
sugar is better distributed to those who want to get a lot to keep in a mood .
so who was chosen to enter the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was the mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
right back , this is now his position , the white binder on the arm did her rest .
and even K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start@@ up like the one who can take the rod at best in the hand .
he gave instructions , trying to di@@ stract her in@@ mates .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy .
V@@ idal so that his missing fitness ( hing@@ ed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches that , on the devil , come out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only due ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nikl@@ as Sü@@ le did not drop out neg@@ atively in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked pretty well .
Sü@@ le ran out next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both agile and sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm frequently did it hard , and also Sü@@ le tried to succeed in a couple of times a couple of times .
his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; not as we &apos;d hoped it would be . &quot;
but he also showed an extraordinary performance at their debut .
game shift , change of change : &quot; I was also brought to this style . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still used for the re@@ plac@@ ements , one looked after the game .
for example , Rud@@ y did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich said goodbye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard a very interesting sentence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is going on here , I have noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not need to teach the new one .

company satisfied with rh@@ einf@@ o @-@ st@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Minister : Economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still has been economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is more than a year , in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the former Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ders ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke is all blocked . &quot;
the main sol@@ st@@ ice looks Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the placement of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now .
this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the building is supposed to stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also influenced by the Western Church in Trier , which is in the urgent need of the German Federal Railway Plan .
aim is to put the track in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial Group Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
in Trier , the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , like the Wis@@ sing , stim@@ ulated a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz , in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
moreover , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a dedicated company , pra@@ ises the HK .
in the new Master Bonus , Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is intended to be a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent master@@ class test and 2500 Euro if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
on the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time , we sub@@ commands the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the I@@ HK of Trier .
so far , of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set up mobility in the country , so far only 29 places have been occupied .
the I@@ HK claims to give more orders to external offices .
the CDU faction Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the host , which will invest more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 in the receipt of regional roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the field of professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the broad@@ band extension in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had reviewed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
it compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding internet connections and bur@@ sts .
ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already defined the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi should change 8@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options for driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus with@@ drew on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ its diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants to neutr@@ alise the neutr@@ alization of the exhaust gases , take also to install what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen that could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regul@@ ate emissions when a car was tested , but under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several members of the Volkswagen were indicted and others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
former managers , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be charged in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations , after the authorities were accused of having a system installed in order to circum@@ vent the emissions standards in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be difficult to load Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries out proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los B@@ oll@@ am@@ ples and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most published Cart@@ oon @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ man , the short@@ ens of his figures are his brand name .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian tables also records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he struck himself as a drau@@ ght for congrat@@ ulation cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the most happy day in my life was the day when lost in my job , &quot; he said once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris completed his breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again he was inspired by the artists of the city .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish mur@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures spread themselves in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is still sitting on the last morning , but still works at the drawing day , working almost ten hours daily .
over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ se &apos;s favourite animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ ed chi@@ pper .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie from 2019 to the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he sits rather on the TV series , which is how his original drawings are produced in silence .
lav@@ ender de Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is rec@@ lining due to d@@ rought reminis@@ cent of the conditions and because of diseases related insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agr@@ arian research Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in the fall much more .
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade that transm@@ its a micro@@ bacterial , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k , and with very dry weather there is a lot of it . &quot;
and it stands much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of very long vegetable clo@@ cks with a great number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ are celebrates its 1,200 year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a through this organized crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are to take their children into the office , who were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leaving them at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal muscles .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the government list of the government or the map , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , and there have been more journalists in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to have been his office in December 2012 and now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , her editor and inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a son@@ der of the Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , this has led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , journalists are only rarely posed in court .
at Ri@@ od@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ete , even though the terrain is still obli@@ que .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on security concerns the security of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very dum@@ b to waste my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we mis@@ use all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the regional capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the newspaper &apos;s name - which is translated into the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the cont@@ actors went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ lefield of the country , since rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug users , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tranquility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal country with its valuable ports and nar@@ cot@@ ics routes to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , is a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , one of the rival map fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , assumed power members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , according to the sei@@ zing of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ illings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues had ann@@ im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the foundation of five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without going on the rob@@ ber@@ y problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising measures .
reporter loved to publish hard @-@ running investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dare to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , where she also led them .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in the last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either this or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for a routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced her to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions , how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , home and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ curing and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that cannot be fool@@ ed ... and then it happened to Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobil@@ es allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the she@@ ar , some of the reporter asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor himself as not trusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the rep@@ orters passed in the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de facto are under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce left on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ er Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the spending , concentrated on the home town of the Governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the lawyer , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened , so it was caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows , that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug traff@@ ickers and authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) that ruled nearly all the century &apos;s political levels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ car@@ ding cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before had readers viewed by Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its slender body creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ickers that protests against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ or@@ ative Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of further journalists about the office of the lawyer .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become more lou@@ der throughout the country by having written down in organized protests in the &quot; SOS Press &quot; protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and kill them because they said the truth .
it has been asked since then that it is classified by the government , because she is worried that their rage has viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico had been surrounded by organis@@ ational crimes against the government officials and an equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his latest book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that reporter were not only killed by drug chains , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were with the organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group has been allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico do you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay aside from their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include the El Nor@@ te newspaper in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug table with a Editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted to the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was evi@@ dently murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives to that drug traff@@ icking made him fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became rep@@ orters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than once all their teleph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a number of sh@@ ß@@ ereien with rib@@ bed legs and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ st@@ kan@@ te , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ls near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , who kept guard to see if they were in will@@ ingness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the newspaper , the newspaper , whose middle finger for quite sin@@ k@@ alo@@ a was visible , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , the intern was asked to send me to the coverage of the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to escape his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , even a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his sli@@ pped skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ tran@@ quil past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably good condition has researchers that make it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; amazing
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant bi@@ v@@ ore is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something from the surrounding cliffs on the plateau , and decided to look more closely .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy cl@@ umps .
after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you were blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into the science of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mon@@ a Lisa is the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this her@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a wall of arm@@ or , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age used to hide in front of prey , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technique known as anti@@ d@@ ding , which is also used by many modern animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family made the head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours .
the amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the confusion , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the consistency is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ el@@ ta is by far the living animals survi@@ ves .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs have been ch@@ ased by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs being ch@@ ased by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution of confron@@ tation is fav@@ ored as a means of survival .
but most of contemporary animals that use the con@@ sign@@ or - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to spoil , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ man must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was rot@@ ted .
scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ served perform@@ ers to find out what it eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is covered completely with cont@@ acted skin , but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks like today in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ build it . if you play only a little with the eyes , you almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chal@@ k was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest insights will appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ y@@ op@@ el@@ ta has sank after the death in the sea and in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks stretching from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant v@@ ore was trained through the western Canada , until a flooded river flowing into the open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the cre@@ ators still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank boards along the din@@ osau@@ r
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ ving so &apos; rarely as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank panels that carry the skull of animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread out upward .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ piece .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long st@@ ems - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon with a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age were injured approximately 20 people .
after the first statements of the police , at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the port of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a storm , nearly 30 vehicles , including trucks , were probably inter@@ tw@@ ined .
the exact number of the last were not dis@@ closed .
it is a moderate @-@ severe injury , a police pre@@ ver said .
a large amount of rescue vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the driving direction of Munich , some ten kilometres of retreat was formed .
like a AZ @-@ reporter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ way to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade not@@ ified themselves the hall@@ mark of the vehicle electri@@ cians , who now have to count with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 hours a second accident oc@@ cured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thus it was a coll@@ ision between a car driven car and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhau@@ sting .
comes the she@@ ar and w@@ akes up an uns@@ killed or ri@@ ps the passenger in the midst of workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of the breaks are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seam@@ less ticket control .
it &apos;s just confirmed by mobile phone that you can take place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
a test run is currently underway on two routes .
&quot; the offer is coming , we stretch it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available for many further traffic circuits in Germany in the beginning next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway the ticket stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have a online ticket - what already do most passengers do anyway .
you have to have purchased the DB navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient way ticket booking anyway .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you get into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers , a button for electronic dev@@ alu@@ ation appears .
the mig@@ rat@@ ers get a message on their mobile devices that driving g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
if the train companion arrives at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ emed online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - what again will take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; those who relaxed without ticket control wants to travel through our train crew , check out the DB navig@@ ator itself .
this allows passengers to create their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , knows that in addition to delays and de@@ pas@@ sions , the ticket checks are among the biggest wor@@ ship@@ ments .
because often , in any case , one of the ro@@ uting does not have all the documents you need for the evaluation of online tickets .
either credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that must be specified .
the result are endless discussions between mig@@ rat@@ ory and passenger that leads to bad mood in the ab@@ aster or large @-@ room and delays in control of their own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell ten@@ dered up to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted the information posted on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old man who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ ek body that was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she placed her mobile phone to return to a Twe@@ et on people later on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we used to get used to and that we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt sha@@ vers .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinemas from 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and loss , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter , which carried a flower dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ minded me of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police has killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and it will be drawn up .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she does not experience any ek@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would make her a bad service to keep them away from afar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , who was waiting for a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ve them to pass protest@@ ers .
slowly , a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m began to accept Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on ess@@ s @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Zab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to just &quot; document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an , in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who have been born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , who have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ke in@@ mates .
his commitment was closer to Fer@@ rell , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be portra@@ yed , as I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it comes with the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not a Messi@@ ah leader , but to come together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents show &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life as she fell in love and her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell ran and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that it must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and for human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls story is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of movement , who have marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Martin in 2012 , identified themselves as gay to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we &apos;re constantly on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is kept upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insist@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ated type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who shook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a co@@ incidence , although it was on the front line because of a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras have disappeared from F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police are still ongoing .
Fer@@ rell ten@@ ds for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she rings on a chant and she feels committed to this memory , since she passed three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit Gallery moves the people , although it is still not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian prec@@ eded the people in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold the theme hardly leaves .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ illing ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery more customers in the city , the other shops also benefit , fear the opponents of the city .
furthermore , the gallery will be planned on the property , which stands on the farmers market , in which 13 direct market products are offering their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping almost every week in the farmers market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but the delicious cakes of the country will always be happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to thank you , even during and especially after the construction of the Gallery a chance to sust@@ ain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether a direct market in a market hall will be settled in the gallery , the hire is to rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low at the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; why shopping opportunities in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary .
there is enough in our city .
one sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rentals are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what still remains , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market cost during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or will it already make the ghost @-@ bit Galerie to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center , which stands empty , nobody needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a peas@@ antry hall , there is no place in Bit@@ burg thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the farmers market is en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , that are almost irregular - the hung on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ te and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly made diplomatic news to the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition which was opened on 2 August is a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching resem@@ bl@@ ance ) .
she is the product of two years in correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a tran@@ woman and dis@@ car@@ essing dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits , even if any intellectual comment might not only be created with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , had already been talking about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted of 20 charges , including six bre@@ aches against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , their picture was supp@@ ressed , so very much that there was only one grain , black @-@ white self @-@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde per@@ ig - with which it has been associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ ese arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum by extracted the DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they performed an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use have been sent to un@@ equal letters , which had conducted several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ er Images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which predicted a future , in which the President of Chel@@ y@@ ar would be able to re@@ sign the exhibition to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deeper and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked paths to keep the rigid es@@ spl@@ its , which he should fix . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one of the gallery of the gallery , the artistic statement called for Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name ) has been an end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic breakdown &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the artist ) show how amazing similar , at least in biological sight , we all are .
&quot; what people hopefully will take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose Video Works from 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece of the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novels .
she shows Mann@@ ing as it dives with a free speech in the hand of the United States , like king @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech in cold , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - just as it should be done in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ak@@ ras , which are like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was also aimed at work , like everything in the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , forming themselves with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the Oxford University , who was chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were exhibited because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the files of the official Cook County Court .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches passed away .
a warning message was published by the Chicago police authorities that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of events for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as a murder while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been ruled out now and excluded from entering the University of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter , which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College spoke in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investigations in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanting to set himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he demands the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a vision of her position , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a re@@ ig@@ matic tip that happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible dog case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list of criteria , however , indicates that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities reported the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved research by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly accept of state @-@ funded Dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the issue , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report was controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA by the implementation of d@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow , WA@@ DA director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moved in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
this shared the group of companies .
it handles a mere precaution . no health draw@@ backs can be assumed , it was in the Not@@ ification .
only eggs can be delivered at Al@@ di from now on , which have been tested negative to be tested on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ mit@@ ig@@ em@@ itt@@ el .
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency to his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Tou@@ t wanted to compete with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers dare not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was just never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sal@@ vation who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables company to conduct surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tool is used to measure employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
salvation said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows a glance which units have most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low tuning results , so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that at the fore@@ front of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in the next UFO , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee has published a blog post , which , in which those who have spoken , have been punished .
for start@@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility after an overview .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , after the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and detect , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company lets you send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confi@@ dential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief negoti@@ ator is involved , dis@@ comforts are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has been caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is badly treated or ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and cl@@ ays , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 associates and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been employed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes , and have a simple way to achieve their headquarters .
so@@ oner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company conver@@ ts Conver@@ cent , problems , which were previously located in offices in cities or states , were hidden - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair pract@@ ition@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view to the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment agreements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after having collapsed the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which both have support start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only working .
the staff wants to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth working , and that the work you do is profitable , then you feel stronger to make this company successfully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach return , when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are active and committed .
if the Analytics tools promise third promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company shall not take measures .
in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that it is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can motiv@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you have to have ready to have 4.000 convers@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company , Kot@@ ter International , who have seen it too much for collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not following , people will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about g@@ lin@@ t to salvation .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize the decision of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organis@@ ing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company always maintains new insights about the staff , and it hopes for a long term , this leads to a better commitment of workers in a industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customer too .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footage are talking on a page of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ c@@ otic parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ operating minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are return after the three hour exercise , before returning next morning at 6 : 30 to the Wasser@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a true tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players already fully packed .
the compromise route from the two days is more than a day to which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood are practical exercises .
they are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal pre@@ preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the control change of the N@@ CAA , even if they added a further point to the many @-@ employed routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply sque@@ eze it , they plac@@ ards further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it is really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear view of the fields and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which was already eliminated with foot@@ balls , which is a protective shell behind a door posts , no light function will be .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a cleared that it could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people can rent a room there , and set itself to record a practice there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ feit by third parties and their results in the original fee , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify potential counter@@ feit detection and send them to fact that may display results of the fact test from the original article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main distri@@ butors for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , with false stories being flooded in May with false stories , and Germany is supporting a plan to pun@@ ish the social media networks as it did not succeed , h@@ asser@@ tion post@@ ings just like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the realization that stories of fac@@ tions are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make good decisions on what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feeds to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy headquarters in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manuscript from somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ ingly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double client in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b print !
and letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives up to 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would be .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so involved with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England ( &quot; In order to be honest , I have received a little bit over@@ rated &quot; ) that seems to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; New Castle to explore the archives and study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , like the mon@@ oc@@ re creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he mig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes , gardening , and sometimes even with the artists produced at the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access in 2006 than the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the staff just started to take care of the archive , which he said , &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rates said &quot; Oh , throw it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards which represent what had said : &quot; you could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gang ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to embar@@ k on a wider base to the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man to join the newly built castle to join the farm level of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that stood in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farm began in this area and I thought it was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell , staged by his own fun@@ eral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , always make debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell men dis@@ b@@ anded their debt crises by giving them rich old women . I imagine it as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote heritage . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scri@@ b experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ bor@@ än@@ n@@ ki , the site of a San@@ at@@ ry from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : covered over 300 years old Mari@@ bl@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 year old Mari@@ bl@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started her campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto NEU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan together with Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it should be a celebration of the celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on its website un@@ locked .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to appreciate the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
in the action it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s all about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive omni@@ presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other mun@@ icipalities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be found for a medium @-@ digit amount and cost the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the Army
each year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es Pen@@ sion@@ ists and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five @-@ presi@@ dents and Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs now also participated in the deliber@@ ations of the government .
thus , the civilians were in the majority in Y@@ AS .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the Commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , President Erdogan of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als have been fired .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the Movement of Ex@@ ile Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdogan as Dra@@ h@@ tz@@ ie@@ k of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , has been negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup Erdogan had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army in hand ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; army , which manifest itself among others in the lift of the head b@@ ots for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bulk of the army in the army and the security forces go on in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdogan sent by decree other 73@@ 95 Heads of State , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdogan beg@@ ged the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the real masters of the country .
three times , she was calling on her role as a guard of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step back to step , not least on appeal to reform of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdogan is driven by targeted a Islam@@ isation of forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an unknown officer , seeking asylum from persecution on persecution abroad , the Turkish army shall be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
true , such development could not make Nato cold .
anyway , there is an alliance in the Alliance for the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump said of the media .
it looks ahead of reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , more str@@ ingent regulations for vis@@ ing vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the US will be issued in other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will become good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to start track for race cars
over the past few months , over the future of the stand@@ ar@@ dent sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought - now it should be very fast .
even before the end of the year , the tourist route is scheduled to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ utt@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , according to the traffic ministry , construction work will start this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and renov@@ ate the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the country becomes important for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently permanently be coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operator are already familiar with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the road@@ map which used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years .
that &apos;s why the race Shuttle will be regular at December 2017 .
the racing st@@ iff shuttle is one of the popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , in the course of a pilot plant , it had been tested whether the route is sufficiently used by sufficient many people to regul@@ ate them in the future .
the circuit is also heavily sto@@ cked in parts .
the Rise of Sex @-@ Rob@@ ots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought that 2017 may not be re@@ leg@@ ated in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eyel@@ id colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the company provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicon , which feels warm , with consci@@ ously human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt its robot according to your beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot over the form of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o ppen have developed to robots with a silicone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables the example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling , such as pup@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Rush robot with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; ra@@ ves the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its vocal - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired to be fixed , or they can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ordin@@ arily female properties , the sei@@ zu@@ res on rape , if one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , be@@ et@@ ly one of the most .
on his website true True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ ox@@ y with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or simply a different sexual feature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their formation and their growing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and deep in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality as an optional en@@ core with an optional en@@ core . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most men , of course , won &apos;t hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noticed their increasing popularity , they still remain on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what is sick@@ le from the edge zones , can be very educational in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting until the free market gives the permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ cutting that this highly developed sex robot are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened globally in which there has been a president to have become sexually attacked in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ hor@@ rend@@ ous aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swallowed body , and the em@@ itted eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a great leap .
the goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builder , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from her companion .
they have no placement or a background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total under@@ taking .
other words : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid service
tre@@ umps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney at the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy lives
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a binding of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political spl@@ its , which have polar@@ ised the US elec@@ torate , have also split families in the small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Thank@@ sgiving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ sel@@ fers in the USA .
we all allegedly rig@@ ged ourselves to board our filter bubble .
the power of m@@ umps , families are less noticed .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left po@@ ets , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
they re@@ minded me that the unity could have a powerful enemy against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows it , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with which she fought for decades due to the policy , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
for the dining table that certainly is a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the presi@@ ding effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that his m@@ b will no longer be broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the tr@@ ump of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly appearing in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s comic version of the crazy , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - that both occur compared to Tr@@ ump in fact , a very mild off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as a measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t have any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are sil@@ ky and the animals turn around to look full fear about her own shoulders - extremely dark and the k@@ lim@@ mer@@ ising music convey@@ s this in strange manner .
so many c@@ lich@@ és dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city becomes un@@ righteous to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the topic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
but central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old man and two women in the 40 @-@ he @-@ olds can go on it and have a great time .
if I could judge the Car@@ ou@@ sel , I have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull my credit card .
in the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to cover the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this , in order to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation that is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ous , while I tired the experience , to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his joints , which he suffered from prison according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of a first tot@@ alling pro@@ secut@@ ors due to murder after an appeal of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ ad@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s day in 2013 by sending them several times by a door of the Toil@@ et se@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria for her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to put an appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too dense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authorities said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer , Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the quad@@ ru@@ pe@@ ers from F@@ act and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into holidays and in secondary schools .
three of the students will go to Loyola @-@ Gymnasium , four at the secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Om@@ bud@@ sman Office in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes held under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , which grows in the poultry farm , but was released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chickens .
instead of a chicken shed , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken broke out of him , the eag@@ les spread its wings on a high mountain .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the training of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders , around the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leit@@ erin Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to this .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished to meet each district that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed thanks to the colleagues to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps back with trans@@ gres@@ ses , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she leave her students after two years of lessons only very un@@ willing , for it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quad@@ ran@@ kl@@ ist .
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
it broke out with the children of great joy .
eight first cl@@ ones have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians have been detained because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August the police arrested a group of illegal migrants arrested by police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians have been released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied the control of the free camp@@ uses and place each one who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impos@@ e a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what do you need to know now ?
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel riders have to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you should improve the emission of emission of cars from the Euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe provides assess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Bundes@@ amt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customer be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not called any exact date .
Daimler is informed of writing every person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its frame .
how long should the equipment be drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the focus of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the deal@@ er@@ man negoti@@ ator does not follow the environment on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it can be time consuming , an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE will have to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but , in the regions where passengers thre@@ aten .
so far there is no value for older diesel so far .
the ACE is advis@@ ing to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
like the cul@@ tu@@ itive direction on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) also belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will compete with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding of his wife Mel@@ ania .
the Le@@ ar &apos;s progressive TV series announced that Le@@ ar has already announced that they are attending the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the means - and it bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to clari@@ fy their visibility .
named after the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Zentrum is the largest cultural department in the US capital .
the previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we are making the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s City Buil@@ der , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written , but suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been around for 31 years .
and the work makes him still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press interview .
he reports varied , but challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , no application has done the requirement profile .
the city looks for the closest time an architect or building engineer .
so , under the respect of regular service periods - must be enough time for a work .
since Has@@ lach acts for the administration community as an entrepren@@ eur@@ ship authority , the applic@@ ant has to point out appropriate deduc@@ tions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot complete this , they would have to consult the citizens of consultation through to Off@@ enburg .
but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good operating climate as well as good vi@@ be between authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the h@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the building office and its staff .
but in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ scale parking place are some .
the for@@ ties between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the st@@ adi@@ on@@ struction is still on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will hit the latter with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of large playing space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gardening can be re@@ acted to many quite flexi@@ bly .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces are often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one eye to have it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating city builder are emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end , everything &apos;s going through my table . &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high building ) has been working for ten years at Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , his successor is long , W@@ acker says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
if you want to bay Roland W@@ acker should , according to information the town of Has@@ lach , a completed study should be present as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with field architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and building law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are building high and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , atro@@ cities , urban farm building with building yard and municipal hardness and lower construction authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on pipes : southern ground line closed
according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track over@@ head in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ess freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and look for them since night hours .
near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and bike drivers were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a communist coup , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rator would have brought themselves in great danger , and also threatened to train the train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the damage to the Lo@@ k and the complex and the late @-@ minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors could also return to the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic could be guided without disabilities .
nearly ten people &apos;s suits were Friday afternoon , two of them visited the correspondence .
goods are not falling apart , but they had no delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced about 200 meters high lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causing gast@@ ro@@ wers and ble@@ es , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , loss of loss and extreme fatigue .
whereas people usually get caught , meat and dairy products discovered to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found that essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an from proteins to develop immune cells , which promote toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the guiding researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna declared that immune cells in the intestinal pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide in food , do not enter into the body .
cells , which are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues .
when equilibri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance of tolerance immune cell in mice was found to carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance is produced .
the more Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an who had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an nutrition toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us encour@@ ages , if the same system also work in humans .
in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , a kind of immune cell which encour@@ ages tolerance , as it found out that a group of subjects had such cells , but a different group of the same tribal , which was separately housed .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ans had to do with the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ ential and there were six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they lacked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and did not develop these kind of immune cells , and they were created by L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria grow on the immune system , researchers decided to grow into a liquid and led to small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to imm@@ atur@@ ised immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
when researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ ings were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine tra@@ ilers .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. Cru@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ ism in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius , &quot; he believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins on Tuesday before the UEFA Super Cup begins on Tuesday as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and abol@@ ished only 45 minutes , which had to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve prior to the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started at the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did its start @-@ XI at the beginning of the season .
the Independent contained in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished for three further improvements , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; three of four , for this , I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan and went to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be the shape of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising before .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was yet the SPD head , the social @-@ democratic prime minister of ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern to Berlin .
only none of the be@@ acon from the party branch , only no head@@ winds of the covenant - so was the most important desire of the electoral soldier .
since Martin Schulz led the party , the fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , people from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events of the SPD @-@ ruled state capit@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were deep env@@ elop@@ es .
and one by one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more : red @-@ green can &apos;t be reliable reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fra@@ ction of a Gre@@ ens party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the parliamentary election , his red @-@ green coalition has lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner urged the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return its mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear di@@ vest@@ ment of the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and electoral campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ing a SPD candidate , when Friday afternoon , the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ors met the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , represents the majority of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country .
nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland Choice in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ ass@@ uring themselves .
everything will be different after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
it became then - and it became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Tau@@ ber , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite had so smoothly .
at the time , comrades in the weeks caught up again in the weeks afterwards .
then when they had just begun new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next door .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landing officer , lost its Nim@@ bus in the weekend because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because he did so pretty much wrong in crisis communication , making it wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Weil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the VW @-@ emission and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ President had already been in criticism for long term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mi@@ ese env@@ elop@@ es came .
however , or perhaps , perhaps , because in the past weeks , Weil always tried to put acc@@ ents in the wai@@ st@@ band .
the ordering of the former Mayor of Hannover to re@@ build his power in Berlin , however , comrades not remained hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they spoke of Weil a stab@@ i@@ lization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this case , Weil meets the party &apos;s internal force , basically no guilt .
and Schulz are not at all .
at times , comrades will ende@@ av@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger foc@@ uss@@ ed on the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the ab@@ sent@@ ee par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ier@@ es in T@@ west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ oler@@ able and Democrats , like Mrs T@@ v@@ ests her own career entry on interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs T@@ west is not chosen by her person as a direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in but on the national list of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lower Saxony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower Sax@@ on SPD to the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career memory of a future CDU @-@ MPs reject the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further .
he called for the back@@ grounds to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there will be further meetings of the CDU of Lower Saxony .
funding for the village III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can get support from the country soon .
the mayor , Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen / Germany
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of the events so far .
since 1991 there have been in Emp@@ fingen San@@ itation areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the supplement was still at 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it &apos;s finally important to promote interior development , not just to develop new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , one received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount will amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest from the municipality of Emp@@ fingen .
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine such sh@@ ing@@ les , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in the planned area of interest , to san@@ iti@@ ze .
if necessary , the District borders could shift again again .
the ste@@ g represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the Federation @-@ Land @-@ Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would be conducted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ zation of Inn@@ es , to improve the living and employment relations and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measures would be related to object , which means per plot .
finally , the rehabilitation area would eventually set the stat@@ ute .
as of January 1 , 2017 , the author@@ ization period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year it would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishing area to fill a question@@ naire .
in November or December , the deadline is to be completed , so that next year with the refurb@@ ishments can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commun@@ e had to carry out pre @-@ exam@@ inations .
it is necessary to assess the urban ir@@ resist@@ ors and decide when it is renovated and in what extent .
it will then also be registered to the plot for the respective plot in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to Emp@@ fingen and make a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , a major success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore there will be question@@ n@@ aires to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow question@@ naire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it works among other things about structural condition and refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in grey question@@ naire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ sehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , division and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be filled only when the premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a out question@@ naire was not at the same time a request to be convey@@ ing .
new construction measures are not eligible to be eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of the funding after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound principle &quot; function@@ alities - who comes first , ma@@ stered first .
no conveyor lines can be reserved for later . &quot;
at the end , photographs of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make a restoration .
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now been fitted both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a navy helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event , which highlights the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the data of the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was built in Connecticut , along with a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the recordings of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior , the Deputy Commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter met at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7@@ am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained , until the lawn was evacu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service a second squ@@ ad needed for the return flight .
the original plane was carried out during the event at the helicopter while the security guards remained at the ground during the time on the plane .
the recordings presented by the TIM@@ E did not realise whether ultimately a second flight is required .
at Brands Act , President Act forbi@@ ds to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of Brands acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts towards the legislation of government laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is barely a new phenomenon .
President is obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump led an investigation into the background as the presidential plane in the background of his first fight r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the region around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to impos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 practice sessions at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event attracted at the training needs of the airport for the month , said a civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters units flew in addition 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential Supp@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers had no burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in placing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain budgets for the Presi@@ dential F@@ lights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to st@@ und@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D replacement for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for assess@@ ments is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rates for Do@@ D not contain personal expenses , but account the costs for fuel , maintenance , and contract .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to empha@@ size that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives from Sik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ attered with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top leader of the second tennis league will join the S@@ V tabl@@ et@@ eer .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss step in Kiel tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel .
in spite of five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance the leader of the second tennis league has won the sense of reality .
team principal Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has certainly respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
I just find the crew very well on the back positions . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it &apos;s getting hard for us as always .
there you need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
at the moment , it is still working at the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , Fren@@ chman won &apos;t play the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is competing for its first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo yesterday was at the ATP tournament at K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball yesterday .
he should be in Kiel but as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on Sunday to the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could back into the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was in January 2016 the number one of the Junior World Ranking List was not , someone out of the trainer to Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America The O@@ MV harm can harm
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for ti@@ ghtening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress had a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional prec@@ epts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels damage the US advance .
after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies , which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
since then , investors from the local O@@ MV are co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies and co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Coast Nord Stream .
the drug is huge .
however , it is too early for estim@@ ating the consequences so the official statement of oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions on life by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are the choice of choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the group could fight off and what could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

scroll backwards : the town poses 46 kitchen hel@@ pers
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with firm contact partners for the children and an assignment for the team .
the clock is turned back in urban day@@ care centres .
as of September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in urban nur@@ sery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also cooked outside house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh homemade .
the town runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year there were 2800 children at the tables , and the need constantly grows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile not only children who will be taken care of 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 am . &quot;
46 Parti@@ ally @-@ time forces have over the 1st September kitchen staff : they provide warm meals , supplement to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seventh facilities - decides on the hour@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ich satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger involved , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is why it goes : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also task of cooling workers - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen output as well as the charm for the city as the most economical solution for the city as the most economical solution , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 sub@@ missions are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at approximately 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ on , Official Head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are in the provinces of the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ presi@@ dents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible , if women participate un@@ restricted and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat negotiations to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will pass peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will even intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan National Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern at investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wishes to make some of the long @-@ term commitment to production at the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie to produce the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company failed to weigh on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said that he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade union representatives will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branches of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about the financing of production lines will not be driven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Vice Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce grew strongly on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising living costs and the chronic production cycle , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a floral production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it because we estimate continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate like all the companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is constantly checked , and that applies to all our business segments and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production plant . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G Barcelona warned of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave the Ne@@ ym@@ ar persecution , after spending an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger his open air cl@@ ause , but have warned about Barcelona three years ago ?
the sensational approach made the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G provides wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans incident is that the club always has its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned of the PS@@ G President three years ago ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they don &apos;t touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , then this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this line seems to have exceeded this line , with the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti was expressed by the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly pointed out that they would not allow it to leave the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; cathedral @-@ atzen report un@@ load Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburg Dom@@ sp@@ ell@@ é report to the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger dischar@@ ged .
this means author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ ile sc@@ andal at the Rain@@ fall of Augsburg provides further discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; he was waiting for publication by the German press agency , he ob@@ servatory from the former Rain@@ fall Bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as of the sculptor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Emer@@ itus Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret on their own in@@ let or their then wrong assessment of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that in the coverage of violence at Dom@@ sp@@ ell@@ é was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be punished by sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go on the church and it &apos;s a nice fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ acking a completely normal pedagog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ fair to apply the standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who registered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ estic Spar@@ rows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ estic atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; thus , &quot; in summary , it can be firm that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
the punishment for students have just been able to compens@@ ate for the students .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike numerous other blame , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in his opinion was reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence at Prot@@ ectors in the Rain@@ y Pill@@ age &quot; are a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lifting of many students , his &quot; humanity &quot; emerges .
in the other hand , it appears also as ch@@ ol@@ aters and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the more powerful , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was making no top performance .
how do you define this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is still in it .
just eight pages devoted are dedicated to him and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of Mitt@@ al or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its active sphere .
you may throw him at least , which is too late , or not to have taken the first impression seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um physi@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was perceived as literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also features an excellent witness as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent teachers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always conf@@ is@@ cated from grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high Emot@@ ion@@ ality , which also already led to che@@ er .
that he cast not only with chairs and cast the key legs and the key legs , but also drew ear@@ thy guys in the hair or ears , he has been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it even years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his honour , however , it must be said that such correc@@ tive methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s were widespread , with parents like teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , the sexual abuse of sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school are indeed Bag@@ at@@ ella .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wonder if it has not yet to do with his awareness and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collapsed on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood it , are still busy .
but the truth is : the report dischar@@ ged Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the issue of abuse during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rain@@ fall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also make any involvement or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dreamed of talking to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a stressed representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has been , however , is that most of the victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ ell@@ ar pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed pup@@ il said it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he could have had tim@@ ely findings in which he could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for real absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben even more int@@ ru@@ sive and clear@@ er or even more opened as compared to their parents , intern@@ ships , confidenti@@ ality teachers , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus comes the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the fore@@ front of affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what concerns sexual abuse is George R@@ atz@@ inger therefore to speak of each other knowledge .
it cannot be denied to him , but he cannot be prevented or transferred to the ad .
hence there is no reason to bring his good name to this contra@@ dic@@ tory crime , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read on the Rain@@ y Spar@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thrown out in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting is mixed and su@@ cked up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also clean separate : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ mir school , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other claims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the report dates from the period since 1945 , so also out of four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows .
the whole horrible test pedagog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were shocked and painted , all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled .
but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already sitting at the dom@@ est@@ ial school .
on it was , as most witnesses empha@@ size , the subject &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the physi@@ c@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to George R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concluded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation still remains to have looked out .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was in charge of the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and was responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
locked Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently in front of the states ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ est@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this , he indicates that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre@@ school the inspec@@ tions will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the danger of negative press release , it recommended urgent need .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity were forbidden in Bavaria as a investig@@ ator .
before that , they took on a legal grey zone , like each one of us knows .
it was hard to estimate for him , where people may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit has been exceeded .
you can &apos;t say that it would have always looked out .
that just isn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 , the penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
the princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to apply the current pedagog@@ ical standards on that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking hist@@ ori@@ ans because of the &quot; par@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past to present moral standards .
the princess is right now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which is far beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s all very horrible and I &apos;m glad that it finally works .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ in@@ ation and punishment , so ear@@ ths and ears to draw near to hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment , then he has also strictly forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother der Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother der Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the issue of Prü@@ fer also come to the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. tells about his perspective , as the domain spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t believe that he was a stric@@ ter Regim@@ ent there .
but that has to be said once again : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which call for an un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world tran@@ spl@@ ant , true cultural acts of Europe and his musical tradition that went simultaneously in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with biscuits and cand@@ y alone one makes no big singers and standing before every success , at which area , always discipline , passion and self over@@ coming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , heart@@ ed , deeply belie@@ ver and heart @-@ good people , of whom you could not imagine that he could not only be a fly .
I have regular contact with how many former domain names still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ itus , please visit him and read it , he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family .
those who don &apos;t forgive him today , that he once was strictly speaking to them are definitely in the minority .
most of the domain names are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and commun@@ icated to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lo@@ vable respect of respect , to which they still appear today and hon@@ oring them .
and please , once again clearly : all you have to submit to him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans , which were then on the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just to make a man just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al fall @-@ goat .
since is the evil intent that stands behind it , just too obvious .
because the report that has just been published , un@@ load him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the state @-@ area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and probably Germany would probably know that nobody would probably know the Regen@@ sburg Dom@@ sp@@ ell@@ as in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
