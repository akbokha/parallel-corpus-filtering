<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everybody who had to get an exciting day because the car-Navi takes place a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offering of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are everything other than currently - but is therefore very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered, which you can't recognize it as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the larger map, for cities and municipalities were more detailed maps, so called uranium leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were made according to the Bavarian surveying government between 1810 and 1864, and of the first surveying in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bavaria was occupied with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon proposed an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops withdrew from Lunéville of 9 February 1801: there were the neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide state of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" - and thus the Bavarian surveying government. "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison is early / today, the capital is most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the signing, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was created 21 years after the map creation, i.e. 1877, a local district in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, he is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses are concentrated in 1856 along today's plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: a small-piece map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers out of the so-called" "" "pristings" "", "which was derived from the basic tax." ""</seg>

<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 shows the October 19th century, was actually a meadow, and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar there is an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's" "" "street" "" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street names" "" "on the fan" "" "- but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "there was in 1858-59 the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lünen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard led by Gudden the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "moreover, he prohibited the staff to apply violence against the inmates," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of Haidhausen, who employs an exhibition with the Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was place, later it was extended to 500 positions.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth house with vocational training facilities.</seg>

<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "", "the department store was named" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a semen from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days will work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>

<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group cited incidents such as racist fights against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "Sanders died under the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state, and was accused by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of crime." ""</seg>

<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100% of the FBI in 2015, following the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI to share the state in terms of the number of injuries on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also a reply to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to complain about a company for living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the United States had adopted immigration authorities to assert people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to other racenprofiled under the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weightaunching Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing club Weidecaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU, Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac bought a picture in front of the place.</seg>
<seg id="70">The representatives of the fishing village of Schwendemann met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann exert some insights into its operation in which he houses 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young animals, and in five apartments of land houses.</seg>

<seg id="76">The green pastoral care for a lot of work, much must be processed using the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and the topography to fight," emphasized Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elicuous operation and management this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the cycle project and is happy about the leader-promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the afforestation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and reasoning about how they bring their operation," "" "emphasised the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure of this area amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be enforced until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half over leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, the farmers stay at 12 610 euros, which they had to invest at 16.2 kilometers in Weizaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared jidemann.</seg>

<seg id="91">The state railway line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state mining of women.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the holding of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">A premise is the presence of a funding marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be trailperated (slope over 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots currently runs for the fishing industry in 2018, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost of more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully produced fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took up a symbolic argument with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatters and Liberty-Imiters would have prompted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta said," "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is proper properly, but how he formulated it, isn't it really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemportions of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the wormest of the poor:" "" "your troubles, your poor, / your adversaries, who longed to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "open waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not participate in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural analysis: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had an extremely political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republics by showing them in a worn-out classic depiction of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to switch back from the right wing this long.</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptizer for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty may not invite anybody, but rather an early neofold, who bring the American flame into the Umbrian world:" "" "Lady Liberty continues." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not glow the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they had been exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships has been seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking criticism from critics: don't worry about a public office if you cannot reject the fuel from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of the interior policy up to his political principles.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan expected to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and erased their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this very beginning this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the bar of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as freevol, and the online comment was full of an opposing reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest acceptance of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playful his hair-less head to chemotherapy at his side.</seg>

<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse said the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or splash or hassertive people that vibrate online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And they are just real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no troll.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="188">As the staff members of the Governors described as "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in early days, if you have had the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn or destroy protesters and silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit-serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique Hidden Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle first mentioned in the Württembürgischer Urgbuch, Count Hermann von Sulz were sold to the mountain with the parish church at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, according to the document, on the tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church, also a splendid courtyard, belonged to the church or the patron Law and not vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="476">The cartridge right was formed from the early medieval own right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church, and took home with a priest, remained in the owner of this church and could also inherit it.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to put a priest, or to propose the Bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but later he had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window frames were stacked and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was untight.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church's chairs, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing aid.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower had to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve, in 1834, a storm crossed the bell tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>

<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager has been made up of the family - you must always be individually.</seg>

<seg id="1321">"I sought something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot has been overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home not just a development but also a place for Joanne's life.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creative to solve the release." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>

<seg id="1333">"" "it's not just about building a simple platform, but to put steel so that it had the right height above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement has made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius descends via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection is like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the records and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>

<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is quite important, so it happens when you push the door, very easy gliding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne was able to gain extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improvement layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they made it to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high quality materials that provide the room to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself into electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be turned into something quite amazing thanks to good design and increased soms.</seg>

<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when there are larger and controversial cases.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this root, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him about setting the investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>

<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg will not increase sea level, as they swim on the water and pushed the ice as much water as it produces after merging itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shadow leaves that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could perhaps increase sea level, but only in a small measure, writes the British research project about the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa through this organized crime, corrupt civil servants and inaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are to take their children into the office, who were the aim of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the government list of the government or the map, a catalogue of criminals that make chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, and there have been more journalists in December 2012. 589, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have been his office in December 2012 and now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editor and inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hung on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a sonder of the Office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, this has led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are only rarely posed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolete, even though the terrain is still oblique.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting on security concerns the security of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very dumb to waste my time in this workshop" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we misuse all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the regional capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated into the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The contactors went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefield of the country, since rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug users, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget about a minute that there is a state of" "" "tranquility" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal country with its valuable ports and narcotics routes to the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), is a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, one of the rival map fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, assumed power members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, according to the seizing of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues had annimitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the foundation of five colleagues for the founding of Rioce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without going on the robbery problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising measures.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved to publish hard-running investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dare to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where she also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a lifestyle," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in the last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either this or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of so many... why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>

<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for a routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to ask her own assumptions, how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, home and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-curing and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporter asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, who described the governor himself as not trusted.</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, mile-long stems - and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) the late thursday afternoon with a mass arambolage were injured approximately 20 people.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first statements of the police, at 17.00 hrs. between the port of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), during a storm, nearly 30 vehicles, including trucks, were probably intertwined.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of the last were not disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is a moderate-severe injury, a police prever said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large amount of rescue vehicles was at the accident of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the driving direction of Munich, some ten kilometres of retreat was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ-reporter, it also occurred on the counter-way to massive disability - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The firebrigade notified themselves the hallmark of the vehicle electricians, who now have to count with sensitive punishments.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 hours a second accident occured on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Thus it was a collision between a car driven car and a car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tested "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: exhausting.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have a online ticket - what already do most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have to have purchased the DB navigator app, which is the most convenient way ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "Comfort check-in" "" "works so: you get into the train, calling his ticket under" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The migraters get a message on their mobile devices that driving gast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train companion arrives at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already deemed online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - what again will take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who relaxed without ticket control wants to travel through our train crew, check out the DB navigator itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to create their travel time in the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our staff have more time than today to go to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who often drives train, knows that in addition to delays and depassions, the ticket checks are among the biggest worshipments.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the routing does not have all the documents you need for the evaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between migratory and passenger that leads to bad mood in the abaster or large-room and delays in control of their own tickets and taking the Schaffner at the end of time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and it will be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she does not experience any eklatant racism, it is no different than the next black women's child.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, who was waiting for a campground as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>

<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Zabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just "document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestrake inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment was closer to Ferrell, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, documents show "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she fell in love and her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that it must be certain vulnerability during this work and for human being." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells story is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit Gallery moves the people, although it is still not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian preceded the people in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the theme hardly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while the one-bit gallery say," "" "This would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" That "" "" "would be really great" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "no man" "" "(Siggi Billing) or simply:" "" "megalomania" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build a gallery more customers in the city, the other shops also benefit, fear the opponents of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Furthermore, the gallery will be planned on the property, which stands on the farmers market, in which 13 direct market products are offering their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping almost every week in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mostly our eggs, but the delicious cakes of the country will always be happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to thank you, even during and especially after the construction of the Gallery a chance to sustain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether a direct market in a market hall will be settled in the gallery, the hire is to rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this should not be low at the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping opportunities in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, Drogerie- or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rentals are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what still remains, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market cost during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or will it already make the ghost-bit Galerie to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, which stands empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasantry hall, there is no place in Bitburg thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market is encapsulated, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, that are almost irregular - the hung on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupte and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst had a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly made diplomatic news to the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which was opened on 2 August is a Becoming Resemblance (A matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years in correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a tranwoman and discaressing dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits, even if any intellectual comment might not only be created with these genomic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, had already been talking about the identification as a woman since its puberty, was convicted of 20 charges, including six breaches against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, their picture was suppressed, so very much that there was only one grain, black-white self-fie, in which Manning is visibly sitting uncomfortable on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde perig - with which it has been associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forenese artifacts such as cigars and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the trash to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they performed an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse have been sent to unequal letters, which had conducted several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Supper Images" "", "which predicted a future, in which the President of Chelyar would be able to resign the exhibition to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"" "" "" "there is also something deeper and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweaked paths to keep the rigid essplits, which he should fix." ""</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen to a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "in one of the gallery of the gallery, the artistic statement called for Manning with their oversized signature (the" "" "i" "" "in her family name) has been an end of the" "" "automatic breakdown" "", "their foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the artist) show how amazing similar, at least in biological sight, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take away is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose Video Works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece of the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as it dives with a free speech in the hand of the United States, like king-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech in cold, then they have won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "never stop the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came from a letter that she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - just as it should be done in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, from their own genomic simakras, which are like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 associates and more than 500 locations, Convercent has been employed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes, and have a simple way to achieve their headquarters.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy headquarters in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectingly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve symptoms of patients with inflamed bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causing gastrowers and blees, recurring or bloody diarrhea, loss of loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">Whereas people usually get caught, meat and dairy products discovered to relieve their symptoms, researchers found that essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells, which promote tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The guiding researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna declared that immune cells in the intestinal patrol to ensure that harmful microbes to hide in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an anti-inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance of tolerance immune cell in mice was found to carry a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan who had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and an on tryptophan nutrition tolerant, less anti-inflammatory intestinal milieus encourages, if the same system also work in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">In Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, a kind of immune cell which encourages tolerance, as it found out that a group of subjects had such cells, but a different group of the same tribal, which was separately housed.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbians had to do with the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced DNA sequential and there were six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiom and did not develop these kind of immune cells, and they were created by L. Cruteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria grow on the immune system, researchers decided to grow into a liquid and led to small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immaturised immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan Metabolism, known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanings were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach-intestine trailers.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. Cruteri develop the cells in humans as in mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the deadline is to be completed, so that next year with the refurbishments can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then explained that every Commune had to carry out pre-examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The decision of the White House, a navy helicopter to fly to the South Lawn for an event, which highlights the American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers to the data of the military, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Chief Executive Officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter was built in Connecticut, along with a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn landed, according to the recordings of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "" "the commander of the HMx-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior, the Deputy Commander for aviation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter met at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7am on the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long remained, until the lawn was evacuated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service a second squad needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original plane was carried out during the event at the helicopter while the security guards remained at the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings presented by the TIME did not realise whether ultimately a second flight is required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">At Brands Act, President Act forbids to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicate that HMx-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we asked if it was a violation of Brands acts, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "" "" "sounds as if you are closed," "" "said the deputy commander." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "the event" "" "Made in America" "" "was called the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act." ""</seg>

<seg id="2731">"" "" "" "at the event, the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated the efforts towards the legislation of government laws." ""</seg>

<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMx-1 Occupations often lead training flights in the region around Washington and in the South Lawn to impose the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMx-1 led 58 practice sessions at the White House.</seg>

<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers had no burden for any of the other props that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in placing the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain budgets for the Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to stundarization of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD replacement for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight lesson.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for assessments is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">"" "" "" "these estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the rates for DoD not contain personal expenses, but account the costs for fuel, maintenance, and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter for the event.</seg>

<seg id="2754">It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize that. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "cathedral-atzen report unload Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspellé report to the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missile scandal at the Rainfall of Augsburg provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," he was waiting for publication by the German press agency, he observatory from the former Rainfall Bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as of the sculptor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritus Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret on their own inlet or their then wrong assessment of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however, criticised that in the coverage of violence at Domspellé was measured with" "" "two measures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it would be punished by shameful and shameful actions, "the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "" "we are happy to go on the church and it's a nice fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "Smacking a completely normal pedagogical means" "" "was to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply the standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who registered" "" "My Brother of Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547" "" "Domestic Sparrows" "" "were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domestic atzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "thus," in summary, it can be firm that Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for students have just been able to compensate for the students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike numerous other blame, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in his opinion was relieved by Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of Violence at Protectors in the Rainy Pillage" are a contradictory picture by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lifting of many students, his "humanity" emerges.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In the other hand, it appears also as cholaters and perfectionist, which became the more powerful, when a Domspatz was making no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you define this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is still in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages devoted are dedicated to him and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of Mittal or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the preschool took place outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may throw him at least, which is too late, or not to have taken the first impression seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium physiasium on which he worked was perceived as literally -" "" "redemption" "" "," "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also features an excellent witness as" "" "warm" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "competent" "", "and" "" "competent teachers" "" "and" "" "always confiscated from grapes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high Emotionality, which also already led to cheer.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he cast not only with chairs and cast the key legs and the key legs, but also drew earthy guys in the hair or ears, he has been deeply regretted and apologized for it even years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "to his honour, however, it must be said that such corrective methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s were widespread, with parents like teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also seen this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, the sexual abuse of sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool are indeed Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "you wonder if it has not yet to do with his awareness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood it, are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report discharged Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the issue of abuse during the" "" "Rainfall" "" "was reported." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also make any involvement or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dreamed of talking to my father or mother," "" "said a stressed representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the reconnaissance of sexual abuse has been, however, is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspellar pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned pupil said it: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he could have had timely findings in which he could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for real absurd to assume that it is reckoned to him... Buben even more intrusive and clearer or even more opened as compared to their parents, internships, confidentiality teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus comes the report on the very clear result:" "" "that in the forefront of affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What concerns sexual abuse is George Ratzinger therefore to speak of each other knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be denied to him, but he cannot be prevented or transferred to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence there is no reason to bring his good name to this contradictory crime, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, there was much of" "" "violence" "" "to read on the Rainy Sparrows." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger will be thrown out in the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting is mixed and sucked up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "" "" "there is also clean separate: between the preschool and the gymnasimir school, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other claims." ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report dates from the period since 1945, so also out of four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were shocked and painted, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to be ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already sitting at the domestial school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On it was, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the physicatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to George Ratzinger, in which the report concluded that" "" "many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R." "", "and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation still remains to have looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was in charge of the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and was responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Locked Georg Ratzinger consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domestatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this, he indicates that," "" "that in the preschool the inspections will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Due to the danger of negative press release, it recommended urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity were forbidden in Bavaria as a investigator.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took on a legal grey zone, like each one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him, where people may be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can't say that it would have always looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards on that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking historians because of the "parachronism of anachronism," thus the danger, past to present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "but this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, which is far beyond." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very horrible and I'm glad that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplination and punishment, so earths and ears to draw near to hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment, then he has also strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "My Brother der Pope" "" "has played in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother der Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of Prüfer also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI. tells about his perspective, as the domain sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't believe that he was a stricter Regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once again: without this perfectionism, without which call for an unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world transplant, true cultural acts of Europe and his musical tradition that went simultaneously in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">"" "" "" "with biscuits and candy alone one makes no big singers and standing before every success, at which area, always discipline, passion and self overcoming." ""</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "what kind of people did you experience George Ratzinger in the talks with her book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have seen Georg Ratzinger really well and again as a wonderful, humorous, hearted, deeply believer and heart-good people, of whom you could not imagine that he could not only be a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I have regular contact with how many former domain names still today, 23 years after his Emeritus, please visit him and read it, he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him today, that he once was strictly speaking to them are definitely in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain names are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and communicated to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respect of respect, to which they still appear today and honoring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you have to submit to him are guardians, which were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
