Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that &apos;s clearly the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or will be glu@@ ed from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she explains as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at home , the actress enjoys her time at home , in front of TV with lo@@ cker@@ em rub@@ ble and mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the white blood they bring the question of child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child@@ play &quot; is A@@ ni@@ ston as a single parent of two sons .
the film runs from us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gets the sports pyrami@@ ds
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
Bernhard Lang@@ er , at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyrami@@ ds &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses remembered her celebrations , they were hunting at the fast g@@ pp home to feed comfort .
one kilometer at this temp@@ o , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lang@@ er says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV on a horse , he didn &apos;t even stop for photography .
this was the first time in Aachen and also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala pyramid .
in awards , it does not lack the lik@@ able athl@@ ete .
Federal Government , Silver @-@ bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ mired him .
the 18th winner of the pyramid of pyrami@@ ds is long .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more prominent sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. ma@@ iler winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent includes the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ di and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ eh@@ mer , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ le Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the jumping win Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ le Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society mig@@ rated to the jumping stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Presi@@ dents are however at the tax and energy policy and in a fundamental question .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a general , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the state , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with tax and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
himself , however , it would be very different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive massive regul@@ ators , and it is strong for reaching tax reform with lower tax principles - for private people and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money .
therefore , taxes would have increased for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
to be invested in the needs , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost nothing .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , some party discussions could still be approached .
the differences in the energy and climate policy are more obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and over@@ ride coal hydr@@ ation in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate change agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to strengthen and demands renewable energy with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there will be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ one trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but just American jobs better .
they should be paid even better , Clinton calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger re@@ warding .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t want to do this question : once he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to escape the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics hold him before , so the budget deficit would only grow bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton says that at least of the rich man wants to pay more taxes , and their critics said : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman fle@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who escape alone , almost already in everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has sought refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby who is at the most one year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is a business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because of them or thre@@ aten them or death because their families will send them to Europe as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced prost@@ itution .
this keeps them away .
this is continuing on the run .
&quot; that tu@@ g should ask for example a bottle of water a sexual action , is no rarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , once they arrived in Germany , is telling B@@ ahr .
here too , women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ omin@@ able .
this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in the northern part of Munich , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not developed voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they are often not able to help , there are more accommodations just for them , ask B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for placing the refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments .
in Schw@@ aben , there are no more fle@@ dged women alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ land and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are only one @-@ standing floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two main accommodations for women only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or are accommod@@ ated together men and women may come together - for@@ getting violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study .
like most of the women of this prot@@ ec@@ torate , we can read on the con@@ gest@@ ion that gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; having been around since it has been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily create a second house .
assistance : demands for new work @-@ related measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assistant of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures relating to their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more workers from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it would have been given to minister to be concerned about the concerns concerning the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assist@@ ants and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ tives have agreed on the rejection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the contract that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and promp@@ ted the official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board appointed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of calcul@@ ating workers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these disputes lead to assist@@ ants this year six times , the first total failures in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , the leader of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , came back to the election of the agreed contrac@@ tual terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , who were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hun@@ t , said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outer side@@ walls &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin gets his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receipt , I cannot defend myself from int@@ ru@@ ding that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was the surcharge , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked nar@@ ro@@ ly and had no warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even improve .
the next day , a paper described that Erdogan had been so ben@@ evol@@ ent than it would never happen to happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to interpret the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ aming , sustainable cold showed that Russia &apos;s state of government had nothing forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his quotes : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was exhausted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin was part@@ ed from and accused Ankara , who fell into the back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaving was even bigger , because it was committed by an alleged friend .
the v@@ et@@ ches re@@ build is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly , it seemed as if the Turks would carry anything to blame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Earth &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fought this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin was the ap@@ ology of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is obvious .
Erdogan is primarily needed to get all the friends which he can get after last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on char@@ ter@@ wings , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late autumn ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the State television predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported will be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it was the response to the trying to sei@@ ze power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the sustained res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he called for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is charity for Moscow , a self @-@ evident fact that itself has changed a deep @-@ sitting fear of regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ full palace in the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one of how it once described me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of outer side@@ walls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that made themselves from the West and have been treated badly and are now al@@ lied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , between the two still great differences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but Russia and Turkey support mutual pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both presi@@ dents have said that they had not even stri@@ ped out the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey seems to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus on it , where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect discretion , as the NATO member of Turkey , it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland : no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand linked to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then , the bank has changed since then eight years ago , the bank had to be saved and saved .
in this time brand str@@ ate@@ urs &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer financial brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but won &apos;t be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the head office and the stock exchange to Nat@@ al will change .
Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s trademark is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private client business which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our investment brand as well as the brand that our employees will be busy as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
now , I say that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own churches for something completely different and our employees will work among those brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer run his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori accompl@@ ishes his 3@@ .000@@ th win at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double with New@@ market which brings him 3@@ .000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured its 3@@ .000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he placed at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack , with its second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reached a milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy to have happened with New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the cheers when he gets his victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career @-@ up
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before .
he has style and is strong , but its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has been enthusi@@ ast@@ ically enthusiastic fans for years now .
I said Frank@@ ie in several weeks ago with Ep@@ som , that he had already brought 6,000 gains , if it were not only a weekend and grand tur@@ ni@@ fier !
Frank@@ ie has already written nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat screen for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven , &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he had difficulty passing difficulty when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fi@@ ance its branches and to return to its top .
and he &apos;s not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 50@@ .@@ ten years old .
Russia &apos;s Putin fires Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin had already dismissed his staff of Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of Putin &apos;s eng@@ aging trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is that Putin have ordered the mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian President . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a substitute for 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , became his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned National Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) , and worked at the Tokyo embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it &apos;s called ( in Russian ) that he later was the principal officer and par@@ atro@@ head of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a leader and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Russian television station on Friday , Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and gave V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff was on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ culous action for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently knows this .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was glorified as a potential President , would ever like to guide Russian environmental policy - crashed on big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in an interview to me at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ ying for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the K@@ GB of State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Patent Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in most .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term president of Russia in Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin was infr@@ ing@@ ed against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish , situated in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for the fish help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were washed by a fountain of fountain .
Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ land Cros@@ sing : bridge connected with fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck @-@ b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is finished around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lash parts .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
today &apos;s economic minister Keith Brown gave a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of a truly epic degree from this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the deck gets a bed@@ itor for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to his place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone at every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is the tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ quality construction .
after installation of the last street cover and its connection with the North Sea deck , we had to close the gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern Zu@@ er@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ icky activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be drawn up by an ascent of about 3 % .
he@@ el , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
luckily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off fishing boats before fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned around to the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w off the boat apart from its range until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and hung up on a bu@@ ff without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board ship boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were cast into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ ch , but this dis@@ b@@ anded by the person speaking of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has gained over these men today .

who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors in future will be much stronger in the duty .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD proposes the next install@@ ment of a &quot; action concept . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : who wants to build on urban areas , there must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable rentals can also be built in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the grand pri@@ ce@@ point in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you looking for investors to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to spend at least 10 percent in such areas , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing program that will cost millions of costs and has to be financed , should provide inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few rules .
the left plans still hardness resolutions for investors .
regardless of whose , Brat@@ mann , whi@@ pped the situation of the situation on the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
but the program doesn &apos;t look completely : for the approx . 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built any@@ ways .
how do you compare the loss of about 1300 favorable rentals in which promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planned monetary spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the town .
besides , it would have to be thought about to get apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western town .
this is a blow to solve the problem .
because in the western town , dead@@ lines run off at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western town is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in only a few city parts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there is still a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child play no longer to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time , on screens , was filed in the last decade of many .
in Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and be more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then to video games and most recently on smartphones .
that &apos;s why it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I will of course draw me on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters , which initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena in pop culture , the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July .
market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smart phones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; .
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the train and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game resulted in a considerable increase of steps which lay down the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 35@@ ,000 users , told that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , that jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company does not know who Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the resource data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public en@@ lighten@@ ment campaigns to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting active on deaf ears &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public em@@ bas@@ sies are boring to health and come from people who look at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even close together new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ack@@ er@@ mines , which must always be compl@@ ained about something .
yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could follow our activity , they gave us no reason to play sports , as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be confirmed by time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and be able to help many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold at the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all the immune system .
dynamic on the ski @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
definitely brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes below the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly above the silver medal winner and the &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze award winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig bars during the single @-@ day event of women in the gymn@@ asts of the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual Americans that gains a majority titles and altogether the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final score was shown and her long journey occurred at that moment .
this success puts it in the same league like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years its sports art , 15 world championship bar@@ bec@@ ues - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I ever saw . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans are Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ class women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bal@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday while at the deportation celebration of the team @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a ru@@ ff sign .
although they insist@@ ed on top of their long way , never planned the future , it is not really true .
a part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling passport - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit home across the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl who was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , was delivered .
it has no longer been lost since the summer of 2013 , a winning series which will stop so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led through two turns , the image resist@@ ed .
Swe@@ des and dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title .
they sailed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat on the floor again with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently when she a@@ waited her grand@@ child - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they used to be in their collecting book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Tie@@ bo@@ an Must@@ af@@ ina went .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ alists , which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after its soil practice , she threw the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ orts , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for this , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a very new meaning , from the very beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead men who have been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ment by Phoenix , while listening to the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a fire fire@@ arm while on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a prey , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police pre@@ ver of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators have led the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at whether they are linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two others were injured in h@@ isp@@ anic resi@@ den@@ ces within four months .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked and committed by the same murderer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting down , carrying out an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his parents Edmund Mikro@@ z@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself leave .
what is wrong anyway ? of course , one has left it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund could never recognize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do it &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with the help of a remedy .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year , neither can he still speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring &quot; Sign Language &quot; to him , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not typical drawing language -- she says . Edmund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected infected infected infected infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know yet .
I have no longer asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it &apos;s getting better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floods cause b@@ ail@@ out in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rain falls .
numerous rivers in the sou@@ theastern Louis@@ i@@ anas and southern I@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding to extreme rainf@@ alls , reported by the National Weather Service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are already standing by the local authorities in constant contact with local authorities and on the way to the communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Governor , told that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain in this area .
in southern Alab@@ ama a Fl@@ ut@@ early warning system was used on Friday , while in the field of Mobile continued .
the Com@@ ite river close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river close to Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Louisiana , are reaching a record level after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ding many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger because these rivers run only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river N@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , finished on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue Team will still keep people from the flood in the Am@@ ite district and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strong over night .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , would have warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife Hans@@ ford told her that she had lived there in the 48 years where she had never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members have all disabled and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved every three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods had spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapidly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , a ob@@ server near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was significantly weigh@@ ed since Wednesday .
authorities expressed that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding were caused by residents of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and education in five camps .
the C@@ BS subsidiary EM@@ L reported that an or@@ derly set up in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rob@@ by Miller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the authorities were rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven animals , who have been ten@@ se from high water . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond there were not@@ ary information to host the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed and sand@@ bags for residents were provided for participation , which we hope to keep water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major floods , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to become a similar incident .
in sevent@@ een the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues on the Gulf Coast .
according to his details , a hand@@ ful of houses were reported on Thursday as floo@@ ding , but on Friday there were no reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rub@@ b@@ anded by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; out@@ dated shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police inform@@ s that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several guns , including in the lung , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital when consciousness was .
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ cing of balls , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surg@@ eries .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in the German town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical condition , reports to the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just determined whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators sold C@@ BS Philadelphia , that apparently , it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between several archers .
cartridge he@@ els for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , paraly@@ zed the scene .
it seems that it clearly acted around a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , leg@@ umes were found .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I propose to myself from the Women &apos;s Olympic Park in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer olymp@@ i@@ ad since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez who inspired many young girls in other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ess is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is round , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female tur@@ ner@@ ship a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ emen .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual Americans that won gold for women &apos;s individual events .
Mann@@ ed member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witness@@ ing the top of this sport , but so turn classes in the whole country do not look .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily associated with private gym , which can hold from parents , which are used for training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) . the list can be arranged in any way .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Turner will receive its overall training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tur@@ nes .
we must be inspired by the commun@@ es of Au@@ n number@@ less , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easier accessible gym .
I founded my gy@@ it@@ ement for 20 years .
in my events we have trained free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and H@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer to the youth up high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real depic@@ tion of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team and thank you , her so many young girls with different background are motivated to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise other strikes after they refused to have Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants , who vote in a vote , refused him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to conclude the treaty and said that N@@ HS would be in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekly , to improve the care of un@@ disturbed movements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants accepted the proposed contract after serious concerns and sow@@ ing it to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is running .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ving disputes in the government &apos;s efforts to engage and sometimes engage with de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by a promise that Jeremy Hun@@ t made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t must now act , lift up the forces and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out more workers .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100,000 dates in front , since nur@@ ses and specialist denti@@ sts were involved to grant doctors on strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to provide a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS , called for assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures do not reach the only little ones , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked about the comm@@ ent@@ ee of the assist@@ ence , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries have been positive to concerns the concerns and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ricul@@ um , training holiday and gender equality in medicine - such as serious , employers , health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication that was recommended by the authorities to submit more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ inn@@ ate drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack causing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have been advised to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems for four years .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have been advised to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems for four years .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by inc@@ en@@ ings o@@ ily fatty materials in the arter@@ ies , which form exposure .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks out , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already a heart attack , subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a , is driven by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft bill of N@@ ICE , released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health Research Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively helps to reduce other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft recommendation is not recommended for treatment over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ per Rah@@ man was removed during the release of a government report about corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to the widespread election fraud in Muslim communities , as a devastating government statement today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es interfer@@ es with the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber on the evidence of electoral abuse on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now a anti @-@ corrupt regime , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off def@@ enses outside of electoral cables to protect def@@ ici@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a failure to prove their identity for elections .
at present , a v@@ oter must only call his name and address .
the report suggests , un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person , if they em@@ it their vote , to prevent someone who chooses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
it demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of un@@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial mit@@ es that approach it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ v@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corruption and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had brought forth his critics with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it should be the reli@@ ance of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the sequence of im@@ itation , when one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric told that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ election - the older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the watches of expres@@ sions to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised , particularly women and young people , in particular to elect communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ischer or ban@@ ew@@ y background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions should have ignored such behaviour as such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terms regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists deal with letters to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May is also requested to prevent tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the electoral code to immig@@ rate and social stress .
consider options , voters in front of choosing to ask your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , once they have given her voice to prevent someone who chooses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are sel@@ ective .
a three year limit on mot@@ ions to an automatic post@@ election .
ban that political activists have complete post@@ ing elections and proposals by post@@ ing elections .
the police give the power to set up bul@@ ations for poll@@ ing stations .
a law that facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation under the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photography pro@@ hibition on poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English is used in the elec@@ ting stations ( with exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff will prevail that voters go alone into the cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and find it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case has not been filed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices than un@@ tau@@ glich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , it was particularly well @-@ known as the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the sen@@ sel@@ ess &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the election departments of the Town Hou@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Court of jurisdiction in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of parliament , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of election fraud and leu@@ ka@@ emia of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double Car@@ ver and other famous doubles of Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio include this week on the French cyclist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of its border and band that has proven to be an impressive dub@@ bed of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only to have gold fighting the athl@@ ete , which has its own famous dou@@ bl@@ ers - at least not when you have to give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces flowing back to our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ies that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ land .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from the K@@ ates Double @-@ seek@@ er on the bike track many people go on the internet as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after images on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the she@@ et@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave that he had already been listening to his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see a great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a hand@@ some guy , so I stand this well as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the ar@@ ming simil@@ arity between the British vision Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor &quot; &quot; &quot;
another comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hard@@ ly , which has similar heavy eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ baked skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ est@@ ed by fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter User was very happy that others also liked the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
theory in the space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are nearly identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. soccer star Wars solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons between Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , who is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , big smile , resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .
C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese flo@@ ats have died like a pig . &quot;
Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds Analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free stil@@ ted audience of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ hic games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief went &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was switched off when he will stop his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought to the comment team of the C@@ BS on board was to hear more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swimming pool Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers in Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Has the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style st@@ aff@@ s for women as well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard to talk to him many of them asked .
Twitter users didn &apos;t with@@ stand back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you just present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like Ras@@ si@@ sts . # attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , moder@@ ated for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an un@@ fortunate form@@ ulation , I &apos;m sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times in people who have responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter
the commentary code Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued an announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it sincere , that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we have ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly with our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clear one , Byron &apos;s comments relative to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortunate form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to justify himself , trying to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swar@@ ms in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ sion , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not covered them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark v@@ ows about woman who &apos;s under@@ going under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went out their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try entrepren@@ eurs .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered them as she looked in it , and put them back to the shelf .
they went on and tried four pairs of sub @-@ boxes in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tasted the under@@ pants before they put back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recovered and the store left without buying something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of washers from the pool , pulled off their own strings and pants and tested them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried not even to find a little more discreet place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the op@@ presses , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like nothing to come back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching them - or think about the person who would buy the op@@ presses under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think that someone would take home with her , who had an other person and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sau@@ lt at home and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that happened on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in folk stone , aware . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming to question were drawn from the sale .

regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your sk@@ etch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are paraly@@ zed from behind , then you should be aware of yourself as a replacement , so that you can see your Att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the Line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and shoulder , before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the dead and turn off , while the attack@@ ers face pain together , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun , grab the weapon and turn them away , so that the attack@@ ers cannot shoot .
once you shift the weight on the weapon and strike the attack on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and to judge the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ fers .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est thing to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide and guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eler under@@ went his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - sc@@ ared up some of the most dirty and ec@@ static places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk changed its course on a euro scar@@ ce , a gel@@ ding kno@@ b of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system .
in front of the le@@ ver of every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show ourselves what he is going to let .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought , to pull the flush button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he sigh@@ ted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ing pots of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , the earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was just fair to his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed an L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number is fresh washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number fell over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not touch anything here , because it is here indoor .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we led mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary that we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed to lick it , such as the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to them to ch@@ uck them and others in which it was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents conducted in 2015 associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ at cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , a sho@@ cking employee found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were torn holes , wooden seals were torn down , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family moved and it is assumed that she is now living in a private apartment .
Donna Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the apartment was no longer to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who had lived in the apartment in the meantime and said that the police , who had added the family , inti@@ mi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ aming , spreading and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement of ant@@ ins@@ ulated behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property , in which past drugs were traded , the wood chi@@ ves were consumed .
neighbours said they had to fight on the road and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week viol@@ ently from the property , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors who said that their lives were taken to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the crowded side of the church house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant sow@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and the family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful for their neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall and members of the community that have gra@@ ce@@ fully committed to us and have provided us the information we have made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate comfort , and convey@@ s the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation of the ground .
workers of property management will now have waste disposal areas , surround the house
in 2014 , police found a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ities and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was a fine of money , after being found guilty of a drug of class B in commercial view .
it claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will del@@ ve a ten@@ ant , who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row was told by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they may behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ ins@@ ulated behaviour , who continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

today , the Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this is the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual , due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility , but the Air Force insist@@ ed that safety at no time was endangered .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Me@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese title would put the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ pedal was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches with them .
they with@@ drew from the tri@@ b@@ une and left their shel@@ ters on a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for myself , &quot; had Z@@ hang fol@@ ly said .
after the game , gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma had to really fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first sentence .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amt of great problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional states to pay their majority .
the presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment in which usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals in the race &apos;s own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , doubts still grow on his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
iniquity be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media outlets .
rep@@ ubli@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ sts w@@ ack@@ eln
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ s from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor from the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , were on the same .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance , which are common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would stop the advance of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich for him , that &apos;s okay , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good life of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump allegedly committed to under@@ line funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better conversion values .
instead of what if one wants to attract the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the Congress more strongly .
Olympia : three sc@@ am fraud with d@@ oping test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ma@@ ach Olympics .
after a fun@@ eral vision of a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee told how to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ ary told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was given a urine sample under the name of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red I handed over .
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya from the D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to strict investigation , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to D@@ oping control station and issued himself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red I issued and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the athl@@ ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes who stood on the list for training inspec@@ tions of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has been over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics Military Leader Michael Rot@@ ich has been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
it should be informed of cash payments from his country on offensive D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
at the IO@@ C , Kenya has already been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping promises .
at the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 D@@ oping target checks before the Rio Olympics , un@@ typically would be pointed out that athletes of Kenya and Russia were taken into account .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put much pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law has been adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took off from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control form with the WA@@ DA rules are .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals during the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a number of television reports , ARD will always be raised again that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as it employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby , it has been proven that in this sport @-@ field surface and systematically origin@@ ator .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classic temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ te Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
in this stage Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Maria .
she re@@ members with wor@@ m@@ wood to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because they are musical extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
she is therefore clever , naturally also nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I called as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singers : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honor to work with her .
it is an enormous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we have passed the refugees , the Pu@@ eb@@ ik@@ ans went to New York , and the New York people did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as it happened .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died after her family shortly after her family had begun to leave the country in the war and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war zone - to stop people ever to make this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ in@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school girls from the East London went into a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

because of the hard drive of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Kurdish town@@ ship of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I will continue with tens of thousands , medium term with some hundred thousand shel@@ ters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight against the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kurds have been on the flight within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , the secular and opposition ethnic Turks are added .
many are going to re@@ boot in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees to take refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group of staff compl@@ ained the deliber@@ ate sett@@ ling of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ an towns .
therefore , Erdogan wants to increase the trip to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out or exp@@ elled already in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Federal Government demanded that the Federal Government is positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erdogan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as Gü@@ len supporters destroy teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and Erdogan is engaged on packs , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and secular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already identified the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution .
on 30 June , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and thus almost 29 percent of all known as an un@@ authorised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , the population , poverty or perspectives are not worthwhile .
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , thus followed by government site , individually .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia cannot choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for stupid as so far it does not work : summer holidays , heat and land .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elections , are on vacation .
most of the tourists traveling in the country , Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so don &apos;t be able to choose the country &apos;s day .
and practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are able to infl@@ ate the plac@@ ards , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and will count on the end of the votes .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let us go for election campaign just over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly lag@@ ged behind the CDU .
it will be exciting , how powerful new@@ comer to AF@@ D and what remains at the end of co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , looking from its large posters .
he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ ases a little with the people , just as it did already his legendary password ? Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and is a Chancellor Merkel to blame the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are able to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of the right lists , which will probably cost him to the fair office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she was invited twice on German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is in the north east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU turns largely on market conditions on market places and shopping m@@ alls with s@@ uns@@ ha@@ des and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country the basis had to go away , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any part of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU on his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it we@@ ars where people are : dor@@ ff@@ est , golden weddings , every birthday party must be exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and only slightly ahead of AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election in 2011 , SPD decided yet to win at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , can create jump in the country day .
they make modern Indian holidays a modern virtu@@ e and put on the internet for its election campaign .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is called the National Chair of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green bul@@ war@@ riors start to search for local voice offices among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ine lakes and it is still nice .
your impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from lock
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for the responsible persons of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end up only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are omni@@ directional praise .
&quot; they made all quite soft , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the South at the beginning of the year , until the end of October everything should be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mutual agreement will also be praised by the responsible persons , for example when it goes to furn@@ ish the heating cru@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site moved to the south and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been abol@@ ished and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is re@@ located , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the escap@@ ing traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D vice @-@ president responsible for transport management , Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local residents of Bach@@ el Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ stre@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths sought and more their Nav@@ i confi@@ ded as the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
as the speed limit is not observed , the congregation demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable differences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a place on the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been blind@@ ed .
the fastest lap was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at B 27 it is just a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales in them , everybody who asks for them to look through .
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for other companies , for which the renovation has rarely consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most light drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also does that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drive shaft is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most poll@@ uted are the local roads along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not just him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
it was lacking clients of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
it divi@@ des revenues to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street measures have been thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have acted differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt could give on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there is a financial compensation , which also benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they have to bring the dis@@ advantages that are devoted to the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other land@@ marks , where something more generous has been handled .
at all Kl@@ agen G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now subject to most complicated traffic guidance more often , it can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere beautiful .
at the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about that .
despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the counter @-@ terrorism in laws .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has oc@@ clu@@ sion status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs at the presentation of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
others , further points would initially discuss within the parties .
even to this I am jeal@@ ous of myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Interior , however , be located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; att@@ ain@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg , Germany and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère was given a little time before he presented his conclusions to the security in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have already been announced , pro@@ claim@@ ing that a new security authority should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU direc@@ tives for passenger data and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personal security personnel is not surprising .
partially , Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terror groups under punishment and ji@@ b with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ aming the CDU @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he nevertheless hold this nevertheless for reasonable and don &apos;t demand anything with the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
this is partly in itself : it plans spe@@ edy methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for deportation of people before the deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted specifically into the country should check in their smartphones and expos@@ e social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Dul@@ ces for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some more worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or deliber@@ ate their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
some even acts un@@ exploited and makes questions open .
and with a number of points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says M. Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be found that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in the face of the high refugee issues , many people wor@@ ries about safety .
and things that are deeply concerned , don &apos;t let the people fail .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , there are election campaign .
the Union and SPD are therefore increasingly facing position on the subject of inner security .
in recent days , it was high between the two parties .
first , a gar@@ ris@@ ky quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the department leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also going to be reconc@@ iled here .
there is nothing from a turn from a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you will re@@ build , be not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition , he constitu@@ tionally related legal concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to show the coalition partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot inside what could help for war .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filing an eye on inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel initially sign@@ ates carefully and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming to assist .
in spite of diesel engines , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
on the recall function , there is a concept for a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ sport can lead to a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets despite its many brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and charges the overall sales , like that in the Da@@ x not@@ ched entity .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous month .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries to almost a sixth .
brand subsidiary Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , I have given a purchase restra@@ int due to &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on leaving the EU also loaded , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gases are first calculated , there is also a Min@@ us book .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the affected house stamp of Nieder@@ sachsen seems to be further enhanced by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 percent is to € 3.@@ 37 million .
in January to July , Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales platforms from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen to this time , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls some 2.5 million cars to upgrade to workshops .
in the course of the upgrade , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after changing the vehicles there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance no wor@@ sen@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach station sets the client after conversion a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate culture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports that Volkswagen has now become a guarantee for converted diesel models now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture .
from the traffic department , it confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfilled the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; variations of this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , after conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all typical approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in business travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers may come to the conversion for example a half year after the conversion into a workshop - and this can result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interests it is important to avoid that it is possible with any other damages that have nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ ment sc@@ andal , as it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding any warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank@@ roll Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is just about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on gre@@ ed or day bank accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speak of a single incident and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their austerity pun@@ ishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund starting from September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 Euros on gre@@ ed or daily payments .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost to € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said .
he has been spending 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the others , and which he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me in central bank account , and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost is now continuing according to the caus@@ ative principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to leave in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &apos;s v@@ aults , would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four failures , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of our clients have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to wear is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business @-@ sustainable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal charges for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank had made head@@ lines with its sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief negoti@@ ator of the banking industry , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide discharge for deposits , with the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks a lot too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff which is a little l@@ ush from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operative association Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks that calculate an initial tax rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anks had declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of driving into neg@@ atives was very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany do not hesitate to leave this in width .
Dest@@ ination records : who is buying records ?
lonely men , middle aged , love plates .
before you come to comment in order to over@@ look him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ alle@@ vi@@ us men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multiple recur@@ ring of records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record , are all pre@@ views after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older Platt@@ forms retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone at spending time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would lead me with the camera , while I live in the bust@@ ling street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest ho@@ ist before I stop , my hands hold and somewhat imp@@ atri@@ ation like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is gr@@ asp@@ ing slowly to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices , now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the camera man to switch the camera for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow by Sister Ray ( Data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data number : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and go through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy items as it was sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es to those who buy the records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my car .
GMT , 25 , which is working with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets with the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy back their old records .
from the convers@@ ations I have led , people usually have been emp@@ tied to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to detect that record shops offers a soothing community of par@@ ables .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to retreat to stability of familiar sound @-@ platforms , of objects which alert the happy youth strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of materi@@ ally poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s like a collector , and I think it is so for many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee of a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey on IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month has not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I was bl@@ azing at Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ es .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Data number : three men in middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came in here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record , so that I can put them to the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product heavy , less musi@@ c@@ cess@@ ful .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which come slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound panels nearly a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go to clean@@ se .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who do photos , teen@@ ager and women in middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores , Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ pack@@ ers pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but brand mental trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to realize when one stands next to someone 30 seconds .
El@@ anor@@ a , 27 , runs around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the Vari@@ ations of the plates for sale .
it makes a man@@ nequ@@ ins rather than a big shopping .
it ear@@ ns not much , therefore the collection of panels is not real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a loved sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers will have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that Je@@ ans &apos;s hot@@ spot , I observe a group of young@@ sters that groups themselves for a moment of Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to gras@@ p them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most for luxury objects like plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though my research suggests that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collectors in S@@ oh@@ o , who exist in reality , record shops and online .
these people are likely to work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ urs@@ day tomorrow with safety , not with the ring@@ ing of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plat@@ ters , while the star@@ ing views of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator t@@ aps over the shoulders of absence of middle age .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is the longest living wh@@ irl@@ wind - vide@@ ot@@ ape
scientific say that Greenland has the longest life of life from all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius Niel@@ sen , who exam@@ ines shar@@ ks , says that the record was lying at a female , assumed that it is assumed between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long .
French Court re@@ jects offer of demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week the authorities argue that the state should be fu@@ cked down 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally to sell to 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally and sell , selling hair@@ dres@@ ser services , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fireworks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the government &apos;s supported association and other groups not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also led out that the provisional business and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just people living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely pre@@ k@@ ative conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet hits will offer between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places , which was threatened by Nieder@@ re@@ issen , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s Café des camp , which is administ@@ rati@@ vely operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , plus a consultation on asylum applications for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates that the number of refugees in the jungle has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ets over the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be analysed in peace , which might have caused reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title during the upcoming World Cup in Qatar in October .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must be set up on the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be considered particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , using highway construction or to re@@ forming bridges with temporary tem@@ pos . there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide with a stationary blood pressure to comply with speed lim@@ it@@ ers .
a durable mobile device can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in continuous measurement operation , the case data will be encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected through several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ates as well as access road to time , sched@@ ules and vehicle class can also be used .
in the highly @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in measuring mode , so that the wheels cut in pan@@ pan@@ es and by the way also shr@@ ub @-@ safe outside cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is being tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ month Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class fet@@ ches gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ month Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji saw a master class in the handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , re@@ jec@@ tory , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic aille of any color .
the defeat was failed by the non @-@ bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had struck a 15 @-@ man team in order to form a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is likely not that at least a gold medal will be hanging around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former boss of England from Wimbledon .
UK had a difficult way behind him .
eight years ago , it lost sight of Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sl@@ ag is going to hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderfully and made the attacks of GB@@ s of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . an , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with another four minutes time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he shifted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has the ball .
a splendid t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a placed a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u stepped through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB Team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s so , as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB are still se@@ eded .
it is like this too .
GB made basic changes for half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half of time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game was long in favour of the South Afri@@ cans , whose fans sang and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful fi@@ j@@ is approach .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame replaced the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ r hit , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB of cr@@ ushing destroyed in the grass .
before the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ Hour Teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cra@@ t for rowing in the trainer .
there will be no more bi@@ al gold than in these games , and that &apos;s what you want .
from the first rowing precip@@ itation to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the herd , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all@@ po@@ unded when they recru@@ ited the second day for the second Olympics in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports that put on such a scale .
her dom@@ ination was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter was un@@ lag@@ ged , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ in which reflects on the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of will@@ ingness to contribute to the incre@@ mental adv@@ ances that make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the trainer , who would survive this day at all , as with him cancer was diagnosed .
like he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bli@@ ster cancer , the oper@@ able and they did so .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had good luck that he could start treatment early in 2014 , out of the season , which held the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case this is the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it begins that way .
rowing is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ fertility of the victory , her first thoughts on Williams who had a nerve @-@ wre@@ cked morning so spent a little bit more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much it means me , how much I and Helen and Robin have been working .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I could not wish for a better person to train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with whom their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark joined , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were really tra@@ pped at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get involved with it .
we had a good start and at the same time , we were not trying to make some rab@@ ies .
we didn &apos;t want to make a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take off for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , clarity :
the general manager of the water @-@ purpose association , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide . &quot;
a small F@@ rän@@ k@@ ischer drinking water association as a model for the great water producers .
this was the case that it was in the original version of the Bavarian Radio in a period of time ago .
a little later the water forum was stran@@ ded by the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group &quot; Bavaria is widely regarded as exemplary . &quot;
behind all that is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin association , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 during the age of 65 .
the drinking water chamber with seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the con@@ greg@@ ations of Kirch@@ alle , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supplies for other cities and mun@@ icipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ keeper since 1988 and was appointed CEO of the twin association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they sc@@ ary from water management and maintenance activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency calls on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , refurb@@ ishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) and the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) .
I have given no breast@@ feeding . I have always recorded new features , because water li@@ de@@ fied and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , she praised G@@ öl@@ lers , trusted and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart disease for his water purpose and he lived in the water chamber , and he would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he served as true pract@@ ition@@ ers to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ion group to the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
for that , he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part of his part praised the Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a faithful cr@@ ater .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the fountain design and restructuring of the purpose of purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult commitment , however , were the tu@@ bing of the flood on a 3rd January .
we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
you can also only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n because you filled the blast container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ abs .
the management of the drinking water chamber was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who enters the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and killed them fatal .
&quot; the man called himself and stated that his partner was shot , &quot; said a police worker .
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him will be publicly de@@ pl@@ eted .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a glass .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man we@@ ars a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , so the police .
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police talks about an association .
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck first wanted to do any data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing k@@ deli@@ mit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police worker in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ ten@@ sive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that threat@@ ens the industry from the green electricity promotion , are off the table .
it will remain at the liberation of renewable energy sources for the so @-@ called self @-@ production plant in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the blast furnace for power generation , to ask for cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional cost from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission for talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG re@@ location of 20 percent will be replaced .
but also these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the European Commission &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to produce their own production .
to this end , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be fixed .
special meaning has the successful efforts by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &apos; is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;

since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from excess capacities and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy than the world &apos;s largest producer in China given its weak@@ ly domestic demand to the global market .
European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping before .
during this spring the situation was relaxed .
to a show , import duties on import st@@ ole effect , for others , economic prospects have increased in China .
un@@ clear , how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp continued with caution on Thursday .
last the prices had been stag@@ nat@@ ing again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp last wanted not to exclu@@ de closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers stay carefully despite rising prices and increased orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a total of six percent less crude steel than in the previous year as the economic re@@ unification of steel by Friday .
after a short increase in May , the masses went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is increased by two percent below the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association will reck@@ on in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors good
she accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors Choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
inci@@ dentally , they do something good in their health and spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great hobby for sen@@ iors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German senior liga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in chorus and share with like the joy of music , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
being regular , sen@@ iors will establish social contacts and maintain .
because frequently solve social and family structures in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a special form of interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sen@@ iors are a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lungs regularly , even in everyday life is not as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to receive the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Community of Sen@@ iors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people often w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies were sin@@ king for themselves , sick people lying on long tra@@ verse events .
in singing , a special performance is required when singing , explains L@@ enz .
simultaneously focusing on his own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people living alone , practice this way , not just to concentrate on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you go through singing in the chorus , H@@ ackl@@ er says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in a chorus .
to show itself : if I do long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , says L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears about when a clay goes on ?
looking for the suitable offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sing someone out of the circle of a veter@@ an ench@@ y@@ ma , you can just connect .
many cities also offer reviews about cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many veter@@ in@@ arian cho@@ irs can be found on the Internet as well .
who has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the Internet .
who would like to sing , should join a choir , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sing the soul well and has something liberation - this applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect of the hi@@ ves of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals has .
to her surprise the male also didn &apos;t leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in the difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the ra@@ vel of cats of cats at mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond quickly by ten percent faster to those of K@@ ittens , who are in great distress , as scientists have found out of veter@@ inary Academy and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cat may react to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly drow@@ ned young for the males either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of meaning , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of its help .
a total of nine adult hang@@ over and eight babies were observed in the animal position of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a pack of little ones , which were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ ittens , which were also lifted up .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned fast to the loud@@ speakers , when this calls the very bitter kit@@ ten .
this ability may be an@@ born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women react more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ken@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ ses .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important football game takes place for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul is the official name : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business as usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already during the suspension of emergency testing after the crash test in July , the government , everyday life of normal vou@@ chers should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is also not a halt in front of the football .
against the previous star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ken@@ r the public pro@@ secutor set an arrest warrant .
on the basis of this , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is said to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , President of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
while the initial appearance is still valid for 90 days until October , in fact , it has been on the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdogan announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponents of Earth .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count towards the President &apos;s friends .
but what the Turks do the Turks face dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans even agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will arrive particularly on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past season , Cologne led its sporty value as proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season on an outstanding way and secured his crew to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goodbye to the Europa League early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g , it was only six to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the playing year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who talked with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ tu@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig as the base for the 14th titles .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the end of the end of Florence , the Gom@@ ez was arrested in Florence under the contract and was announced by Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , after the coup attempt , not to return to the country &apos;s political situation in the country following his EM vacation .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; the magazine &quot; k@@ icker &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Stür@@ mer should be willing to give up an estimated annual sal@@ b@@ ness to roughly one @-@ third of his € 7.5 million , Or@@ man asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t pay its salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes are still awarded medals odds at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had been locked twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other over@@ taken athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the topic d@@ oping decides to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock her start right before the games , was sque@@ e@@ ased out at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it offered a quir@@ ky scene : she was proud of the hall with a rebel@@ li@@ ous smile and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ sturm .
but there are many more athletes competing in the Rio Olympics , despite d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times due to d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is regarded as the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fraser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit on a six @-@ month lock after you had the in@@ gest@@ ation of the pain@@ killer oxy@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery , they defended a strong pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended Himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion from 2013 and European Championship was positively tested on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drug in meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic suffered the in@@ estim@@ ation and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt side ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive and 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , praying Mer@@ ritt t .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith &apos;s hammer , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been subsequently detected as many medals .
T@@ ich@@ on lost nine years later , T@@ ich@@ on lost nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid d@@ oping and EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the 2008 Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a verdict of the International Sports court .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the world ranking list .

at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a banned dietary supplement has been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
she has taken chi@@ pping and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether of the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ on , also , are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ des two bombs at Thursday evening .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ ar was killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early then two spr@@ inkl@@ es came up , and a further person was killed , according to the authorities .
also by Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police reports .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the Southeast Coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives in a flower be@@ et came to the air in front of the territory .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were required at the South West Coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ on on the Southeast Coast .
there is a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was it .
&quot; the bomb attack bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early before journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to express yourself to possible mot@@ if@@ s - but I probably do the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , stated that the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is more likely , however , that the bombs of the ruling Military jun@@ ta have been laid out .
authorities have had sec@@ rec@@ y in the last days of sec@@ rec@@ y coun@@ ties in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact timing and the places .
it is still un@@ clear which group behind the attacks .
the police dismissed all the country to increase safety around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand , there are repeatedly minor bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of reason of bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office advis@@ es on its homepage to have a consequence of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) directed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel will be made in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution of the jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars the military major influence even in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs have been an attempt to bring chaos , while the country moves towards stability , to improve economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta who had seized power in 2014 following a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , the kingdom continues to lead to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok , a attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine were killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the Constitu@@ tional Protection in the Federation also gave the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Constitu@@ ent manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ aged in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity by trans@@ alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional protection in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the country &apos;s offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group as it stands , &quot; said the constitu@@ ent of the constitu@@ ent .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no ad@@ u@@ sible advertisement for the own thing .
the propaganda must speak emotion@@ ally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
last , from several German states there were reports on contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant to a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , its objective is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
it is , therefore , whether such people have controlled influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
overlooking the substantial increase of legitim@@ ate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not yet again .
but in recent years , we &apos;ve found that it can give legitim@@ acy structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further righ@@ tful group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a wide @-@ wide or wide control of just@@ ification of just@@ ification is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate so worried that many attacks on the account of people who didn &apos;t have occurred in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspic@@ ious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ender or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes committed before@@ hand with right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected by the CDU , SPD or left , which , however , radic@@ alised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist stimul@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or the world &apos;s head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the aqu@@ atics centre sw@@ am the easily over@@ looked s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a return of 48 seconds and reserved the 5@@ 9th place from 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not his just sports figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since most sport@@ s@@ men run the athl@@ ete , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the rounds quickly .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny as a reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first played at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Freestyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters Freestyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim for eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on an election event in Florida .
if there is no choice to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then go into the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US @-@ Presi@@ dential elections in November , it would be either fold or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the CN@@ BC .
if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich for him , it is all right , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he identified US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Hillary Clinton , the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .

Gf@@ K @-@ leadership occurs after dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K is owned by Matthias Hartmann .
the set@@ backs suddenly came - but not surprisingly surprising .
the hard position of the market research company Gf@@ K left that the chair of board Matthias Hartmann is the even more secure , the longer the success of his promised success .
turbul@@ ence at the fore@@ front of Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appointing business numbers and the resign@@ ation of the management , global number five of the industry stands in front of a new beginning .
Gf@@ K @-@ Executive leader intends to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board ( Arno Zen@@ ert ) already leaves from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
on 1 September the management board of the board of Directors of Gerhard Haus@@ j@@ inger gave the management board to the management board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is officially supposed to assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor to Hartmann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the feedback , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy .
details wanted to call a company spokesperson on Friday .
if you become the market research company , it is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in An@@ le@@ ver &apos;s circles it was on Friday , in the shareholders , last@@ ly the dis@@ appointment over the continuing success of years ago introduced re@@ structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures each shareholders will eventually un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ation so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to set@@ backs in the preceding quarter of 2016 , the company could not stop its loss of losses .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable period of the previous year .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales with 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ unk by 3.4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings in the second quarter mainly charged the value of the company faced with its difficult economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s consumer experience needs EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division with a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .

accidents - Bus sliding into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oo@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight last
during an accident of a travel contract with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers traveling on Thursday at Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to escape to an opposite L@@ aster which is partly on the opposite way .
the bus came from the road to the right off the road and pushed into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson on the police , Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s position , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus to be confident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fire Brigade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ance cars and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the last trav@@ ellers were brought back from a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fee per cubic metres of wast@@ e@@ water will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ e@@ water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ is@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased by then , if appropriate improvements measures are needed .
after over@@ h@@ itting the calculation , the waste price in Az@@ endorf is located at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household by the Land@@ rat@@ um Kul@@ mb@@ ach was noted that for these wast@@ e@@ water plants run underground .
the Cas@@ endorf Market was obliged to operate the grounds with the right @-@ right basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ is@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg need to interv@@ ene deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed , a new circulation of the fees for the se@@ wage systems in the market was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover@@ ings from the previous calculations were also compens@@ ated .
the engra@@ ver rate increases by Schmidt thus allowing it with all three se@@ wage plants around relatively small facilities with a very low waste water case , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the small distribution basis , expenses for the repair of several thousand Euros would have gra@@ fted .
the se@@ wage plant in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to its age , hygiene and repair expenses are not least due to its age of san@@ itation and repair expenses .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ etry , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wast@@ e@@ water system Az@@ endorf .
during the pump@@ ing of the pump , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and for almost 20 years of operation , the first sep@@ tic pond had to be removed and an additional ventilation option has to be installed in order to maintain the waterproof def@@ enders in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these exceptional expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly under the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the small se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Schmidt added the market community of great entertainment costs with se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants continue to remain pre@@ k@@ ably , especially since the supply of the se@@ wage plant in Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be extended by these facilities , because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria attributed to Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods have been observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; leisure ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature
snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive toward races .
with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that bor@@ dering the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are int@@ enti@@ onal , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies a day .
all faul@@ ts go to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn into criticism in the past , in which they were accused of propag@@ ating the App Black@@ face för@@ dere or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week broke out a filter , which gave them sm@@ elling , false teeth and dun@@ geons che@@ eks , there are some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly layer . &quot;
they question@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ um referred to a larger problem , that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage has been widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat would have been disabled .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced Rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , rec@@ alled the filter to bre@@ ach c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et has been widely distributed to the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and annoying . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the oppos@@ ing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is un@@ secured , but that the yellow face was drawn into the ab@@ domin@@ ating extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural stum@@ bling dra@@ fts crossed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seem to be involved in endless diversity and integration of equipment , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race than their older ant@@ agon@@ ists - could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering is a picture that is ins@@ ulting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase the Snap@@ chat account , others to do the same .
in a call for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that ra@@ cial @-@ related controversi@@ es has reflected a lack of diversity among the adjustment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and finishing her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either , they have no representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they are people who are working there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company has no figures for diversity of employees and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently adjusted a personnel responsible for sub@@ servi@@ ent population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership on ISIS secret services , the Congress of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed subsequent information to draw a optimistic picture of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states were allowed on site to report a committee on Thursday in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of rep@@ ubli@@ can members , intelligence service committ@@ ees and the military service , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence , reported how pre@@ set their inv@@ alu@@ ation to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intelligence service provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com comp@@ man@@ ders typically have been reported to have a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article about the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cent@@ Com leadership range extends to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct clu@@ es to change government points under Obama , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their pre@@ laws , a optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 there were many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress clearly positive as it represents the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com has announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress held from Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the following assign@@ ments to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after being played to them that the analysts concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General Inspec@@ tor of Defense .
the democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of research assess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest democr@@ atically democr@@ atically chairman , a member of the Adam B. Ship House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of deliber@@ ate reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats stated that we have no clu@@ es on the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon &apos;s General Inspec@@ tion , which were recorded according to complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general spec@@ tion would still be underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ spar@@ ing opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and defense of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the obe@@ dience information about the Islam@@ ist state remember of more than ten years ago , when an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , referring to the recommendations of many analysts only one small occup@@ ying forces in Iraq and little time on it to make thought about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ kers to clari@@ fy government debt that they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge was not published , but the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative for his superior positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US will win fourth match in the field of campaigns of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after she shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American field@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually display a memorable performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and they are identical in their group with the British on the first place , which were un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams of each group will gain the first and second place within their group .
the first placed , the strong Dutch will take some longer out of the path that leads to the other group .
as always the game will go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex in their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games over the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey tennis ra@@ cket ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the team &apos;s history .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to contact the things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the working day in London that we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprising and kept the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball across the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the center and entered the ball in the gate to get an 2 @-@ 0 guidance to the Americans .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but as good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and ev@@ asive , a rapid relay on competition and quest .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch himself would be a burning rod , which is enough to protect the s@@ wimm@@ ers for the tri@@ athletes .
you cannot listen to the TV , read a paper or listen to your neighbors during the queu@@ e in the waiting time without playing Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers and the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a pair of women with dimples , could definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even fat .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , Lake Forest , California , fights for the Olympic trampoline with gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may reign for a long time .
but if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct your attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years saw that many that I had asked , did not know that there is an Olympic class .
that could also be regional ignorance .
although the US athletes sent for competition , there has never won a medal in the trampoline and had to win a athletes until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping on a certain outdoor swimming pool , partly because it sounds like an en@@ lighten@@ ed ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as those for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert but only a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ously potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end , but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports which combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must take a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are assessed according to the official Olympics by execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go on in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go and return , down and down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast another great goal : the world or the Olympic Games .
the purpos@@ eful pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up an audience to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel about looking at these games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the target .
he or she picks up , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ d like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down effort@@ lessly back .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves enter into the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant up@@ lift of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and finals of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming by 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also around 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end as part of a night@@ fall blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably survive in general tum@@ ult .
when the increase of consciousness is only achieved by the attack@@ ers and object of male athletes , as it recently announced the male US gymn@@ ast , according to The Wall Street Journal , - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey a@@ waiting his new fan base .
a generation protests in Ethiopia , Long , a member of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers , political changes in Ethiopia call for the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that sixty protest@@ ers during clas@@ hes were killed by police forces .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the weal@@ thi@@ est countries in Africa , making a solid fo@@ ster of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the Government sh@@ attered the country and continued to spread out more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and the fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on fifty armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , videos about protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with rods , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in major pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to progress through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively brought to silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home said , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use until the lit@@ ters handle in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this tender , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden that were more or less forced to use turbul@@ ence and could be armed again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of ageing have now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones were increasingly frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were all assembled at protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since an emergency , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia mainly to Christian people , explo@@ ded in politics and economy as they carried out the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land regions .
but this is just changing .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate with a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and the military , in secret services , and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly entic@@ ing to make early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current regime there is no lack of skill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively op@@ aque grounds to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in northern Sardinia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had such a ri@@ ot in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed , according to the analysis of the analysis , the government seems to be stolen from the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following raid , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ um train , as well as for their measur@@ able adv@@ ances in poverty .
but obviously , this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it ass@@ umes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ants held in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred in the social media as usual .
analysts say that the protests could bring the US and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights above the neighboring Somalia , even if it has been telling that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ gh@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded on ISIS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , that his campaign would recover , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not meant seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication designed new questions about the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans as it is capable of communic@@ ating and understand@@ able to the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his fellow soldier , who will ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after spending the nar@@ rowing during a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump hur@@ ried back on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews he meant totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to we@@ aken something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism directed at Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ us to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he addressed a strong review on himself when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , he said later , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course , I thought &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages of his fans will arrive as they arrive , and then eventually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , I think it is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even corro@@ sive sound , since its revers@@ als are further declined .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he accused his critics to understand his say@@ ings or to understand his humour in@@ correctly .
but while he is approaching the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump joke have brought his loyal competitors to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in an CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ ump statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in that sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ fir@@ sts , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ ream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister , ISIS was allowed to spread over ISIS in spreading it to aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and threw them on every one of his words and to be bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats over Mr. Tr@@ ump ap@@ ologi@@ zed as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once driven by the market , Café is coming back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front was pushed .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , built in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people treated it as the last loss in an gent@@ ri@@ ving city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is a silk shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new income .
a lively bust@@ ling cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new de@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when it offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ shell , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions .
there is natural bowls .
the café offers no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez , he said that he noticed a st@@ ained power at old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived early in William@@ sburg and attended the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee break , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was coffee and culture in the b , which was pleased to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even though it stood on this day instead of their usual iced Coff@@ ees , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea that is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the fall in 2003 .
he went there before the work and was inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came in quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my food @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order today , but sometimes he is changing the Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t be a gro@@ unding , that the soap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ powered coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish people Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to make it soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ filled coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expanded to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new de@@ b is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café was closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt said that she felt a new coffee at Lok@@ as and the continu@@ ances , as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sing meal of the economic crisis in an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt had an Fai@@ ble for refined del@@ icacy of Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while at the bri@@ ck@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving snack bar in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive gro@@ ves , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mixture ate .
when the Reporter found the reporter , this found the pair for a discussion about food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said brick .
there were pean@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the Americans to be hungry for the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways with which the land was going to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , attack on the subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was also very ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ts were re@@ minded as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ confident the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es as &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ ver lef@@ to@@ ver , as ch@@ efs could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a tiny sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures were tried , because a low @-@ cal@@ ory and nutr@@ itious satisfaction had priority before flavour or even healthy food .
during her research for the book which also includes recipes , bricks made a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a popular addition on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; it continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary bud@@ get@@ ary - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; having published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ ses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ m@@ ly sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peas@@ antry kitchen of his kitchen , he che@@ ered like the one @-@ million@@ th man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was delightful and strange .
President Roosevelt would have done the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to static his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , an annual house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors led by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most likely prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , has been dis@@ car@@ ded once the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
in writing , the couple gave better understood the eating habits of Z@@ bri@@ mans @-@ law @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bricks remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind off .
after the plate had been cleared out at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled off and cover a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um of Roosevelt was eating at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ bri@@ man , and added that it was a common trick to send any recipes to a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

he put his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died during a bombing of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil control group that saved the lives of almost 60,000 people according to the painting newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to achieve their first aid in the war zone .
they are heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civilians who shows him with an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Sy@@ rer for shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes , he never saw himself , said according to the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have rejected four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , a chlor@@ ite filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so not children to play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime should hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest wh@@ irl@@ wind is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland mostly come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean to date .
Greenland we got up with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k floating around the North Atlantic River , in an hour , an average of 1,@@ 220 metres .
only when it reaches , the five meter long beast acceler@@ ates a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
this leng@@ thy lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ is@@ c@@ ept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research by the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist susp@@ ects long that Greenland will become stone .
only lack the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to watch , eventually they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer from the most spar@@ sely populated coastal areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland scientists accordingly .
her time@@ pent@@ emp@@ o ad@@ ows them as they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter .
the prey make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a animal found researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the grounds of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and look for Kad@@ aver , made from higher water layers after down tor@@ ches .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied at 28 Greenland , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the largest 502 cm measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which will not be renewed in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ le .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear tests try to tow larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the lens of the lens contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapon , so it is likely to celebrate his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012 .
in contrast , all major Greenland @-@ pigs had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts being formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ re @-@ long Greenland age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters was even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females then get offspring when they are longer than four metres , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign one age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters was probably determined on the threshold of the sexually mature stood and its age of 156 years was determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries period .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane le@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , was caught in his bacon on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught before Alaska .
due to low temperatures , animals often runs on spar@@ kl@@ es living there .
they mature later - and al@@ ps slowly .
in cold water warm to keep warm , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on how many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist sc@@ rub@@ bing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .

with topics around building , the municipal council in the recent meeting has focused on the most recent meeting .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence Markets and Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial transactions may continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in Britain has so far enough .
that just use big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association will deal with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , press the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the biggest banks of the eurozone , as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk of Risk ES@@ R@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks , as they can communicate so directly to the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
although Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin is worse in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
also , the city with easily available commercial property .
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine the rentals of premium commercial property were 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the city is at rank 7 , Luxembourg on rank 19 , Dublin , place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract new banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W conclu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
for this purpose , the forces of forces : in London , according to figures from Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
g@@ il@@ ead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the refund of the legal costs , which are created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of false behaviour from Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. President of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the cost , which were created during the defence of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck tries to oppos@@ e Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver illness .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ endants each other and cap@@ itali@@ ze on laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir acc@@ uses , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
from the USA , troops were saying that they have re@@ conquered complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
from the USA , troops supported the whole control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after leaving the last IS fighters in the city , said a spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are out@@ dated after the extract of the still remaining group of fighters who buried within the city , currently under the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held host@@ ages held by fighters as host@@ ages , shared by the D@@ KS Military Council of Reuters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just conduct spatial work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
Hillary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 the Clin@@ tons donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton delivered an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , for their book on the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statement of the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons gave his fight in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ unci@@ ations and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is usual for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law for this purpose .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en said special advis@@ er to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before tax checks are not finished .
Tr@@ ump critic , among others , also the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already stated that his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his business couples , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which senior rep@@ ubli@@ can tr@@ ump det@@ ects his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IC@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay for two years or only very few taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and account@@ ants , the indications that it could still be the case .
federal control has become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has moved his seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their control packs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he had been subjected to the IRS as well as a control test of the IRS and have been afraid of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign re@@ signed tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , we paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax declaration by the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most of the Americans .
its main investment fund was a cost @-@ effective In@@ dex@@ fund , which is controlled by the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

con@@ doms with C@@ hili@@ a Fire , Fire Stri@@ ke and Dance Ele@@ gance
Prot@@ ective in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x species to stop eleph@@ ants , in people inhabited sett@@ lements - they throw con@@ doms which are filled with ch@@ ili powder .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already strengthened its support by years ago , together with the US natural protection , trained to use volunteers in villages in the North Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ level method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing without hurt animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend itself .
Friday is the glo@@ omy day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in this con@@ greg@@ ations with a lot more confident that they cannot harm the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damage the eleph@@ ants in their fields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in an Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and bubbles in a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; C@@ hili@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
ch@@ ili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work party in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition is per@@ cent@@ red .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ dens with a pop up and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili powder in the air .
a hint is usually already made to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a golf fire in the air , causing a lau@@ te , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new business operators , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine river , this ki@@ osk does not fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CDU faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashed the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media officer after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , since it had requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shoah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of locations in the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , it is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he got there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it , resolved even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the election is deleted , the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very conclu@@ sive .
the fact that this in Germany has worn in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved quite a big reson@@ ance on the Internet in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged claim of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the noble , Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the alle@@ g@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ verse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record into the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung notes a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the di@@ alling code was added now .
police places Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ raine against Protestant Brazilian students
students were gathering together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they were assembled to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public educational system .
the police replaced Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties started when police officers tempted the students to deal with what led to the police in rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , somewhat less than 100 public schools are closed , whereas 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ers saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its saw the provisional President Michel T@@ emer on walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests happened several days after protest@@ ers in masses went to support the president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in comparison to the Russian ambassador .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another commercial building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade relations between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade margin was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign trade unions gave around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel destinations to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that represents a tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers Iranian tourists in Russia last year has broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russian Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to Pfor@@ te of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ es@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were handled .
in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ wall@@ ers of all ministers in the arena , two years ago , the Ober@@ minist@@ ered Round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ m@@ ages were tested and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where he was on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open gate of mercy at the Frei@@ burger Münster in Münster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ bedrooms made the way .
on the evening , Ab@@ bot Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration of St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrims .
von Hor@@ b was driven by train at the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there is also a Mu@@ en@@ ster beloved wife , and so the pilgrimage was taken away from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short stimul@@ us with various prayers , songs and scrip@@ ting .
but on the way , Min@@ is was making a song to sing chap@@ els , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a customized pilgri@@ m &apos;s book .
the parish of the local par@@ ishes were available for the nights .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were sor@@ row@@ ful for a tasty and strengthened dinner and breakfast .
continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
in the morning , one took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting ground , but had to be climbed down about 500 elev@@ ation at least 500 m altitude and then be caught again .
the deser@@ ved reward was dinner together in the evening .
after the morning , on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
deliber@@ ately facil@@ itated and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was given to God .
at the evening trade fair in Münster , the Min@@ is &apos;s pilgrims was welcomed by the operator Markus O@@ bert .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner looks back home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the team @-@ team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of anch@@ oring his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y gave himself to E@@ igen and made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ed to return home from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of six olymp@@ ic medals .
they repeated the trick , after taking place in March at the World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ der appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ tors - and Sk@@ inner placed an olymp@@ ic event in the qualification round , but in the standard round , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders triumph@@ ed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ ds returned to his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a major part of transformation in the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner allow to stop the temp@@ o .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed a olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after a triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave rise to the path that he was looking for a weak start .
he returned this statement later and no ob@@ jection of England ri@@ vals came .
this time there was no such problem with such a good victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the entire UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we have been so bad for so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who have won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated the victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the coming of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which will begin today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win with his colleagues .
it feels really lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be struck down to the Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on contest of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 am .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the race , with Wig@@ gins with safety in focus .
yesterday , he fought against the qualification yesterday when officials call him to measure his height .
in the respective Women &apos;s Competition , tomorrow continued and finished , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world of world @-@ time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a cup of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ ings as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then , as the legendary call GB@@ s , who reaches its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of melt from Portland due to re@@ vocation of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are standing in the game since the system operator will announce the energy supply contract , and that all delivery contracts run by the energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout set for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are located on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
moreover , it could get to domin@@ ance effects , as the melt consum@@ es around 10 per cent of the total power generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa decided to melt the Point Henry melt , which led to an closure of the Far@@ es@@ ea plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ eth a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium scrap with its Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is mainly owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L is going to continue to run the plant in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still said that the tre@@ aties called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month cancellation deadline , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supply .
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong operating markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to make the contracts to operate the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... &quot; or not det@@ ects power to the melt . &quot;
the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force in November this year , even if there is a declaration that it has been signed from the contract .
analysts were war@@ n because of the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 mega@@ watts each year , with some 900 mega@@ watts each year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vog@@ ue .
in Kendall , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this verse to weep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dis@@ closure of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ) , as they forget the cover of their sister Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the Pop@@ ular Show@@ biz and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it finishes the cover of their sister and ends with a classic turn : they have planned all a surprise @-@ party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday cake ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
Kend@@ al big sister Kim likes her to have hit the Vog@@ ue Cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking forward to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a gir@@ th , rather resembles a picture @-@ band than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling bearings ( 6@@ 15 pages ) .
the dis@@ closure of his code stars is expected to see that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine is still sick@@ le before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or teenagers of today , who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success every day .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was still somewhat stra@@ ined in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , and called it the &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook again high when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but riding on the mi@@ lion seems to pass by the point .
Kendall J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue Edition .
it is a super@@ model in the liter@@ al sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their leisure time she is visible in the reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
communal centres don@@ ates 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 160@@ .000 of the au@@ xili@@ aries of the country are referred back annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry has taken over the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , ai@@ ded workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar to their search for free legal advice and legal notice .
legal services of the municipality , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts .
starting in June , next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal agents .
the director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families that were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who are un@@ lawful and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help you need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will sh@@ orten the funding by 30 percent , which means thousands of needy people from Queens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and Bundes@@ just@@ iz@@ ers as well as sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to withdraw this short@@ cuts immediately , so people who need help with legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to lift funds for the national average on national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump electoral campaign accused of a weapon to become a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indicted for alleged in@@ action , after it was told that their campaign manager for North Carolina was on an employee in February while they were traveling in a Jeep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the national court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for months to be gover@@ ned by the matter , before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired , to set up damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said to take a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take action , if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and judge the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps campaign made clear that the media would have torn his words out of the context , and that he would not stand up to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ord@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the injury of the care@@ ers of care@@ ers and Philip due to bodi@@ ly injuries and ble@@ aching damage .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey ahead of EU elections : the SPD and the CDU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18th of September ) there are considerable losses for the SPD and the CDU .
this gave representative surveys on the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
during the red @-@ black government coalition led to the north , it is not possible after the conversion values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent in five years .
according to the survey , the party sounded just slightly ahead of the CDU that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contest@@ ed between the left and AF@@ D .
the left dropped to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , which AF@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated with 6 percent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the central urban tag .
with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ en@@ ant , the SPD in the survey is according to only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D was represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ate would not be missed by contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came onto the market .
today , the successor domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer had a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes which would today be rich for approximately two lat@@ itude with high resolution .
an iPhone has now been delivered with at least 16 Gigabyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euro lovers can buy the devices even on the Internet , but they come somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era .
20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as &quot; office in the west @-@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received by fax was also the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if qu@@ aint slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen were found .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
no one could highlight in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ates the market today , all of which came later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units .
the worldwide turnover of the units is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well running shops of the countless app vendors and telec@@ ommun@@ ications companies .
around the smartphone has now become an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use by touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , today is the iPhone &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry dominated the market , they had to see .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now the following is Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ evident 20 years after his invention .
on average every German player now looks onto his mobile phone for 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone even sometimes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent al@@ in@@ ability is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics had great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to achieve new opportunities for local and local companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two branches were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of fun growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we will expand this Olympic spirit and safegu@@ ard He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future business and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ Game &quot; regarding advertising blocking
according to one of the software manufacturing money , advertising block tests , ad block@@ age , come to a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - und mouse game &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers .
on Thursday , just two days after fac@@ ebook , Ad@@ block Plus would block a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it happened that users could update its filters in the program to block ads in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook told that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the encoding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify the detection of which part of advertising is to be difficult to complain .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of hyst@@ er@@ ting open source community and the env@@ elop@@ es have already been underway since the invention of display cl@@ amps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in the struggle is a strong Indian , as wor@@ rying for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are used for the display , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ein@@ gs is 84 percent of advertising sales .
the company has no effect on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker told .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , giving Facebook the investment of such a stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook told that it would update its &quot; ad award pool &quot; to show people more control over them targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users this represents no positive experience , therefore , we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we focused on developers tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman in thought of suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with an alleged suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 , close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , is that of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as each witness of the incident , were reported to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened an investigation procedure which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a c@@ lash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver cannot be with@@ drawn .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acquitted of neg@@ ligence after spending a man and killed one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has been un@@ conscious in the street , and took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court determined that the polic@@ eman had responded -- to an justified way -- the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each one who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate protection model : Venus was once hab@@ itable .
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA Climate Change .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms to re@@ semble from clim@@ atic research .
the model has been designed to determine if the Venus could have found similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have seen that the slow movement of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ding atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protecting faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus was benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exp@@ orting their daily side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , causing the surface to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously suspected of planet@@ able research .
even though it was likely to be hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several years .
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her vap@@ our was removed from ultra@@ violet light .
as its Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate control in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , and led to a minor role in the team &apos;s decision process .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , with energy , passion and destiny , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team in the course of the summer to give it more depth to give it more depth and bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a determin@@ ing right of decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23rd May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the winner of the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
when Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ dis@@ ee@@ ee@@ pers take a talk again , will strike strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all the parties have set a round table on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
spor@@ adic strikes against the oil field service providers were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ united the process process of the present stream , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full day sessions in the coming weeks , start the start next year to re@@ join the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wood Group has shortened the rati@@ os on its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advis@@ ing follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company require the needed room to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for its part thousands of people and announced plans to impos@@ e their oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ rob@@ ber sh@@ utter with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower commodity prices under pressure , an economic situation that abandoned by the British decision in June to strengthen the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament of Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes being held since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea expect an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures Rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ dust of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the newest mission with the Kepler World Space Teles@@ cope helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star@@ ring are rotating at different rates as well as in which connection to the planetary cycles .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our findings , we know more about the relationship between the mass of a death , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ dust of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they now turn the fastest .
to peak levels , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ winds .
because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star climb@@ s , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each ster@@ ling , turning the time between the appearance of a recognis@@ able star spot -- such as sun spots -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger @-@ stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas quicker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare pitch qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ base of Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot before us to learn more about how , when , when , and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the re@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional dis@@ closure announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will take against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say Good@@ bye to both , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
since 2007 , his signature is reported to be 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contra@@ diction on 31 December 2017 , he will be serving as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as a player , it paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he gave the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ est@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show similar values for two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the rest of the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as early as 2009 , the super@@ star gave &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to handling the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect for years for an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida to receive funding .
after a law@@ suit the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his deportation days also did not go silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a deportation tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; corro@@ ded Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az , was married to the actress with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy and friends of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat at Rodri@@ guez @-@ Team .
Olympic 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Target inski are the first d@@ oping cases
hit : wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from Poland won &apos;t start because of a positive d@@ oping sample .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
an old athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ op@@ presses have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
in Brazil , the chin@@ ese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the anyway @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions this news arrives .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a mass@@ aging agent for d@@ oping sub@@ substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in its exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just about 0.0@@ 9 seconds , they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have had to participate in the fo@@ oth@@ ills of more than 50 m Freestyle .
Chen has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and an extra@@ dition hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Chen &apos;s full cooperation with studies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; z@@ iti@@ oned X@@ in@@ hua from an announcement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is not the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S was responsible for the sanctions of the athl@@ ete with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news led about the positive test for Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the athle@@ tic athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the associated substance to act the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately with criticism of Ath@@ let@@ in &apos;s word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t pull the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chronic d@@ op@@ pressed Nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday also the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Target inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as well as his brother , Tom@@ as@@ z had a positive effect on ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both charges the taking , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world federation had banned the entire Russian team , except for systematic d@@ oping the start , even L@@ äu@@ mer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier clubs in China had taken care of heavy disputes between the athletes .
thus , Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang P@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium about 200 m Freestyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also in the centre of a confron@@ tation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping bet@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested by the Chinese championships for the pac@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but had only had to sit down a dre@@ ad@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock .
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de sque@@ eze h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware are currently protecting targeted companies - and are very successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were re@@ adily available , re@@ trac@@ ting the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially saving ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying quick evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rator of the black@@ mailing software discovered for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the transition to company attacks were terri@@ fying quickly in recent months .
ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active in the computer of an victim , it is looking for long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ othing Bit@@ coin .
but where private users found the personal photo database on the game , companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which still stands out .
accordingly , the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to cancel the business activities completely , with one case people were in danger of danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of health care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you just promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to refuse in the process of perpet@@ rators in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ acker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a current study , F @-@ Secure security researchers have investigated the user surface and get in contact with the black@@ heads and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their offerings by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , send freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and private people will be rede@@ emed to payments from a few hundred euros , companies need to negoti@@ ate hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to rep@@ licate their data un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building kit to the real black@@ mail .
the existing malware kits were created by using the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ tion tool , so smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ mail then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers in order to spread the freshly sold software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus , one is log@@ ically in one of the forums , buying the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ ferred calcul@@ ator .
&quot; typically , the crimin@@ als carry sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
meanwhile , Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is known for many companies that safegu@@ ard their data better .
over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust ran@@ som@@ ware to asser@@ t ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful development , the perpet@@ rators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the potential for damages depending on the type of data is much higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too , the perpet@@ rators will have completely new goals on the Internet of the grain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ating security researcher how they could get with the Internet associated thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a der@@ art blocked heating could definitely be a ran@@ som .
if the do@@ ers instead of the heater to block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and highly efficient
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V only seems small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the barrel much space , it doesn &apos;t seem tight in any place .
the materials of the interior space are well @-@ processed and pleasant , but the cockpit @-@ top is something off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l in reverse spinal cord is available , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magic than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel , offering a storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling of 1,@@ 24 m high .
the luggage boot can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation segments very powerful .
however , his work is slightly qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine stab@@ i@@ lization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the travel behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment has no desires open in the tested top &quot; Executive &quot; category .
the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ builder ( works up to temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ ision control system and the unit assistant .
the coll@@ ision avo@@ ids confused sometimes because he has rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ul@@ ing objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler re@@ acts on the traffic signal recognition and d@@ ros@@ ling on demand the speed .
the full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI socket lie below the arm@@ rest and therefore can be a bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euros , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday life .
air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall to aviation bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only for dangers , which are typical of air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff broke a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
but the accident could have happen anywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease fall : when paid the promot@@ er
after their journey there is only money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in this case , a family was heavily dise@@ ased on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ or@@ rh@@ age heavily in diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective sep@@ tic situation , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the view , the trip was lacking - and I compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the trial .
although the wast@@ e@@ water situation was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ ers took about the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .
in the samples of the water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be temper@@ ed and decided to react at the same time on terror .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to terrorists .
if off@@ ender had to leave the country faster , the security and strength of the people &apos;s consent for the refugee policy .
Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alised gain of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit size order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must stand again under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the arms quite as amended , especially the purchase of weapons is made on the Internet .
the last much discussed sweat light for doctors should remain in terms of Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions , such as endang@@ ering of citizens , he said , with views about psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to oppos@@ e a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for us .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to use the investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly spoke against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an ear@@ head for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the spark group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on en@@ forcement is not problem@@ atic for un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t offer everything you re@@ jects , and I back@@ rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
do you talk about rules about road transport or witness before court .
Simone Peter &apos;s green leader in Simone Peter threw the Minister he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ left @-@ party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet and a ti@@ gh@@ ing of the residence permit people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway junction
it looks regularly on the reverse road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal sense should be extended .
this is good news for all the car drivers who are at the traffic road every evening in the St@@ au , when they drive through the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road @-@ farm road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße , which is the right track for the right track around 700 metres .
drivers can drive straight from the hammer onto the right .
the great advantage : the transport shares early on , whereby the total volume process is improved on the widely used section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster .
driving speed on the Zu@@ br@@ inger b@@ ates the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the return goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g route and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ clock on B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler Street exit .
from here , traffic will be guided only on the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be rebuilt from a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to record especially the heavy duty transport .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected st@@ ion will last , the competent state cannot say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal situation , the country firm consci@@ ously chosen the traffic swe@@ eping time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on on Tuesday and on Wednesday in the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural Trip : cultural offers for schools
the International class of the Wald@@ schule visited the the@@ atri@@ cal &quot; The invisible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater now are planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Society enables adolescents to attend cultural institutions in Münster , with a refugee and refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school in the Wald@@ schule is an introduction of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the society , who has set the cultural integration of youth with migration and refugee movement , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most young@@ sters of the class were come from September 2015 to March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the action though , as the press release of the boys Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , you@@ ths with and without escape and migrant background between 14 and 20 years should get the opportunity to visit profession@@ ally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .

rain instead of star@@ ing stars : hope in weather repair
the weather has made the star h@@ unters in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a rich by the bill - but there is hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to watch the sky &apos;s spectacle , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars of stars in the sky .
among the stars are Per@@ ei@@ des , who belong to the fastest stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on the north east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening you sleep et@@ ern@@ ally around , at night you wake up for hours , in the morning it is far off to think about sleeping .
that is all others as relaxing .
at least one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one @-@ quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanent when not re@@ covering .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many factors underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the board of the German Society for Fl@@ ens@@ or and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you understand land@@ marks , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so a single and diar@@ rhe@@ a disorder .
Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , a member of the board member of the German domestic association with practice in the lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el , are very in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate , &quot; Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , in the German Civil Society .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or toler@@ ate factors can also be used , but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleep problem expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common with a depression &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors are men@@ tioning each other .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , for example , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ ily , about everyday problems and care , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
those who sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week should not sleep well and the day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , und@@ ressed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily ad@@ orable , has stimulation fluctu@@ ations or physical dis@@ comfort like stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to relie@@ ve the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
still in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , are scar@@ c@@ ely stressed in Germany .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , you should first contact the doctor , says We@@ e@@ ß .
this can clari@@ fy with exam@@ inations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in a sleep laboratory , physician for instance at snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory pur@@ g@@ ations , when suffering from illness , or if you cannot find the cause of a flow distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; just make no lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after wired one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one has a nose s@@ ung@@ lasses , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ ae at the finger .
it also shows a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get problems get into the handle ?
there are quite a lot of stud bolts where you can use for better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , not sleeping long in bed , don &apos;t sleep to sleep , don &apos;t get to watch alcohol at the clock - then you begin to count immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler offered a dis@@ appointing holding of the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha and made his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has provided an ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate against his Facebook te@@ amm@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle of € 150,000 would not be surprised by no lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flow system in swimming is bad , the d@@ oping controls , however , is very good .
we cannot compete with countries that have a lot to promote and do not see exactly the topic of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be registered for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever can &apos;t control a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent audit@@ ors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for election @-@ ham@@ bur@@ gers that operates an ic@@ di@@ ele . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bonds of luggage down@@ right
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
the civilian population by Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed several bags and bag st@@ akes as a band .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf a gang that was known by the polic@@ emen of past theft @-@ del@@ icacy .
the two women and two men have committed several del@@ icacy since mid @-@ July of this year , and were still very professional .
the specialists in the crime @-@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can re@@ prove the th@@ ie@@ ves that were especially travelled to Germany , to show four acts .
they had carried over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a few len@@ ders , in between still another head@@ stone p@@ av@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first glance , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one gets past to play , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has a look at the facade of a gray house ! &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl that will be torn down soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents of rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still rooms and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator has repeatedly been advoc@@ ating the project against the project , the area called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rou@@ ded the police three weeks ago , closed parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
during its renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house@@ keeper the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers led by the le@@ ver of sympathy and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained in late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood , an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who grew up here three children , mainly from the police presence .
with the residents of the hood , they share the wor@@ ries from rising mi@@ des and vent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like an Kie@@ z , who wanted to be a majority of police protection from the left on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which is the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ ants and the neighbors , does not exist .
Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district , which also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city .
also house occup@@ ations and the native dwell@@ ings are already a long time for pine : in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the whole Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police force , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become the mag@@ nets for tourists and poll@@ ing liner from all over the world : with them , residents of GDR times and former home occup@@ iers share their max@@ im .
this can also be felt at the rentals , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in raised discs or freshly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades that have been dra@@ ined with gra@@ ins .
no other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbors could consider that as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by the crime : off@@ ences like body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make non@@ damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next 17 years beside the controversial 94 , un@@ certainty can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as for violence , she is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors who certainly did not have .
even the famous burning cars don &apos;t give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that local residents returned to their streets : from the police , politics and media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endless new buildings in the former buildings that displ@@ ace old inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not as good as well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can absolutely not be gu@@ en@@ ous . &quot;
but what should one do if someone has never listened to ?
there is fru@@ stration at all sides , including the police and the ro@@ omm@@ ates .
for signat@@ ures that are anno@@ yed by color bom@@ bers , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who are going on should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain about noise .
all persons presented with pre @-@ name have asked , not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organis@@ er .
besides , she is a social worker .
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officers for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedagog@@ ical team supports the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , workers for refugees , administration , authorities and who else bl@@ ends .
Reg@@ ine customer indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now here who has an ear@@ ring Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , who has a problem above all .
so some - less spra@@ w@@ ling rather than rather don@@ ating on the variety of wish tasks - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for a management expert with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving wool mel@@ n@@ au .
but administrative work is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le believes .
above all , it is organization , work with people on @-@ site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent point for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is assist@@ ing honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the water road
it has been a serious problem since some time to find apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ um to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been a very difficult time for some time .
the management does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , you rely on private dwell@@ ings , so do not work .
therefore , communities need to be er@@ ron@@ ed as it is so nice .
so there will be new containers in the Was@@ p area .
but only with apartments it is not done .
point of view is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm Blei@@ b , it is internship plac@@ ements , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ ressed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house master , done char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the municipal authority leads to a positive influence .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a self @-@ rig@@ ation feeling .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with the locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also you can jump and volunteer here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long run of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it will take , and they can bri@@ be bri@@ dging the time , for example with language courses .
anyone at some point , he can &apos;t help anybody in Ur@@ bach , will not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people in which nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did they fear radic@@ alization , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ ors may call nai@@ ve . &quot; but the chance of a woman could not exclu@@ de it .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensiti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they are the fear that the assassination attempt it completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would happily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main - and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region .
in the background , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach soon .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the politics are afraid .
actually , it is un@@ fair to put them hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we would like , &quot; An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher are already trained to integrate the previous people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : crimin@@ als sought by helicopter
the police helicopter flew around for about one hour - un@@ successfully .
two unknown men are handed down on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. to an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .

the for@@ cing was without success .
