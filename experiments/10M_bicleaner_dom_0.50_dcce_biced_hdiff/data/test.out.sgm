<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidents are however at the tax and energy policy and in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a general, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with tax and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Himself, however, it would be very different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive massive regulators, and it is strong for reaching tax reform with lower tax principles - for private people and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would have increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the needs, Trump and Clinton say almost nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, some party discussions could still be approached.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in the energy and climate policy are more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and override coal hydration in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas to terminate the Paris climate change agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton wants to strengthen and demands renewable energy with their investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"there will be either China, Germany or America - I want we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazione trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both States do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but just American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, Clinton calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "what Trump doesn't want to do this question: once he says," "" "The minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to escape the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton says that at least of the rich man wants to pay more taxes, and their critics said: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who escape alone, almost already in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house has sought refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby who is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into the arm.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honours, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This keeps them away.</seg>

<seg id="28">"that tug should ask for example a bottle of water a sexual action, is no rarity" "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, once they arrived in Germany, is telling Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abominable.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in the northern part of Munich, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not developed voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they are often not able to help, there are more accommodations just for them, ask Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for placing the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there are no such thing in shelters of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben, there are no more fledged women alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unterland and Mittelfranken there are only one-standing floors or their own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two main accommodations for women only.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Rights of women and gender equality" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin gets his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes in receipt, I cannot defend myself from intruding that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the surcharge, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles worked narroly and had no warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand said," "" "Dear friend" "" "- according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a paper described that Erdogan had been so benevolent than it would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to interpret the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's beaming, sustainable cold showed that Russia's state of government had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his quotes: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "Putin was parted from and accused Ankara, who fell into the back." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even bigger, because it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vetches rebuild is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks would carry anything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the accusations of senior officials, that Earth's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin was the apology of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed to get all the friends which he can get after last month at a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charterwings, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late autumn onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as it was the response to the trying to seize power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the sustained resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he called for the attempted coup d "état in Ankara following the attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is charity for Moscow, a self-evident fact that itself has changed a deep-sitting fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glitterfull palace in the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one of how it once described me," "" "Alliance of outer sidewalls" "" ": two countries that made themselves from the West and have been treated badly and are now allied." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still great differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peacemakers, but Russia and Turkey support mutual pages." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said that they had not even striped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the President of Turkey seems to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect discretion, as the NATO member of Turkey, it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="11">Ulster Bank's trademark is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori assured its 3.000th British win at Newmarket.</seg>
<seg id="4">He placed at Predilection, who is trained by John Gosden on his local racetrack, with its second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey which reached a milestone in the flat race.</seg>

<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the ninth Derbysieger had 4,493 career-up</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modern age and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, which only few have reached before.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but its tactical intellect differs from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been enthusiastically enthusiastic fans for years now.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie in several weeks ago with Epsom, that he had already brought 6,000 gains, if it were not only a weekend and grand turnifier!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already written nearly 30 years of winners in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible Jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat screen for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including its famous "glorious Seven," 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulty passing difficulty when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength to defiance its branches and to return to its top.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin had already dismissed his staff of Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was many years part of Putin's engaging trust.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin is that Putin have ordered the missal Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian President. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a substitute for 2012 Ivanovs, became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the renowned National Institute for International Relations (MGIMO), and worked at the Tokyo embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it's called (in Russian) that he later was the principal officer and paratrohead of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a leader and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Russian television station on Friday, Ivanov asked that Ivanov asked to leave his post and gave Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff was on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridiculous action for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows this.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was glorified as a potential President, would ever like to guide Russian environmental policy - crashed on big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said" "" "It is true that I asked you in an interview to me at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complying for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the KGB of State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Patent Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached the power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov could become the second term president of Russia in Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin was infringed against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck gets a beditor for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to his place on the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes the next installment of a "action concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>

<seg id="12">A new urban housing program that will cost millions of costs and has to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as a few rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left plans still hardness resolutions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of whose, Bratmann, whipped the situation of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, which will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program doesn't look completely: for the approx. 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyways.</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you compare the loss of about 1300 favorable rentals in which promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child play no longer to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time, on screens, was filed in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to TV, then to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I will of course draw me on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters, which initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena in pop culture, the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smart phones and search for Pokémons, who will be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the train and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "in the USA, the game resulted in a considerable increase of steps which lay down the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, told that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, that jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who Pokémon Go - it only sees the resource data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public enlightenment campaigns to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to be" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "getting active on deaf ears" "" "because many public embassies are boring to health and come from people who look at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close together new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mackermines, which must always be complained about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier could follow our activity, they gave us no reason to play sports, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be confirmed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and be able to help many people in hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a burden oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I propose to myself from the Women's Olympic Park in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer olympiad since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez who inspired many young girls in other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female turnership a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, yet masterful Gymastikemen.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americans that won gold for women's individual events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manned member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but so turn classes in the whole country do not look.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turnen is a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily associated with private gym, which can hold from parents, which are used for training, training, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list can be arranged in any way.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will receive its overall training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turnes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired by the communes of Aun numberless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easier accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyitement for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have trained free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer to the youth up high-quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real depiction of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic Team and thank you, her so many young girls with different background are motivated to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - scared up some of the most dirty and ecstatic places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk changed its course on a euro scarce, a gelding knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the lever of every object he used a Luminometer to show and show ourselves what he is going to let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, to pull the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he sighted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinsing pots of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child, I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, the earth, worms and sludge." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just fair to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed an Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometer number is fresh washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused, after their Luminometer number fell over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch anything here, because it is here indoor.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led mad Brainstormings that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary that we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film directing of the film, added:" "" "let me say," "" "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed to lick it, such as the eclectic Russian toilet which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things that it was easier to bring Ian to them to chuck them and others in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents conducted in 2015 associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>

<seg id="5">For stupid as so far it does not work: summer holidays, heat and land.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the elections, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists traveling in the country, Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, so don't be able to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">And practical problems: in the holidays, helpers are able to inflate the placards, balloons, flyers, and will count on the end of the votes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let us go for election campaign just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now clearly lagged behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting, how powerful newcomer to AFD and what remains at the end of coalitioners.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, looking from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributed roses and chases a little with the people, just as it did already his legendary password? Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited twice on German Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's parliamentary group is in the north east.</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only slightly ahead of AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At election in 2011, SPD decided yet to win at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, can create jump in the country day.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsible persons of the construction work, which begin at 5.30 a.m. and end up only at 20 o'clock, there are omnidirectional praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made all quite soft," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have acted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt could give on a request from Göhner whether there is a financial compensation, which also benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they have to bring the disadvantages that are devoted to the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other landmarks, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all Klagen Göhner is sure that his restaurant will pass on.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now subject to most complicated traffic guidance more often, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubts about that.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and avian flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant experienced in their long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men, middle aged, love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to comment in order to overlook him under the pseudonym non-allevius men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiple recurring of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record, are all previews after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older Plattforms retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone at spending time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would lead me with the camera, while I live in the bustling street in Soho, a modest hoist before I stop, my hands hold and somewhat impatriation like this:" "" "so, let's take a closer look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is grasping slowly to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices, now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to switch the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow by Sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (Data number: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and go through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy items as it was sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who buy the records, rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my car.</seg>
<seg id="22">GMT, 25, which is working with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets with the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually have been emptied to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records back, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to detect that record shops offers a soothing community of parables.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to stability of familiar sound-platforms, of objects which alert the happy youth strikes.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of materially possessions than a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's like a collector, and I think it is so for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "an employee of a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey on ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month has not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I was blazing at Bossa Nova Kompiles.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data number: three men in middle ages) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came in here and said," "" "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound record, so that I can put them to the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less musiccessful.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound panels nearly a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go to cleanse.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who do photos, teenager and women in middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores, Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sexcpackers pop instead of experimental jazz groans from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but brand mental traumata are hard to realize when one stands next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the Variations of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a mannequins rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It earns not much, therefore the collection of panels is not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is... it drives with a loved sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers will have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that Jeans's hotspot, I observe a group of youngsters that groups themselves for a moment of Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most for luxury objects like plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research suggests that the results of YouGov agree, they are, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors in Soho, who exist in reality, record shops and online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are likely to work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday tomorrow with safety, not with the ringing of Berwick Street and the leaves by platters, while the staring views of an unsecret, 30-year-old moderator taps over the shoulders of absence of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-month Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji saw a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, rejectory, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic aille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the non-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had struck a 15-man team in order to form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is likely not that at least a gold medal will be hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">UK had a difficult way behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, it lost sight of Ryan every game in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slag is going to hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and made the attacks of GBs of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he shifted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A splendid tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it has only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua placed a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou stepped through further weak Tacklings of the GB Team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB are still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like this too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made basic changes for half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half of time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game was long in favour of the South Africans, whose fans sang and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful fijis approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fir hit, the fijis embraced and the GB of crushing destroyed in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Before the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in semifinals with 20-5 and the UK urged South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Hour Teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the crat for rowing in the trainer.</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more bial gold than in these games, and that's what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing precipitation to the last, 220 hard hieve which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the herd, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was allpounded when they recruited the second day for the second Olympics in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her domination was absolute, after all her 39.ter was unlagged, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletin which reflects on the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willingness to contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the trainer, who would survive this day at all, as with him cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had blister cancer, the operable and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had good luck that he could start treatment early in 2014, out of the season, which held the interruption to a minimum, in case this is the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It begins that way.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory, her first thoughts on Williams who had a nerve-wrecked morning so spent a little bit more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much it means me, how much I and Helen and Robin have been working.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he's the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not wish for a better person to trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark joined, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were really trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get involved with it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time, we were not trying to make some rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want to make a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take off for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The news and outrage has been widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US will win fourth match in the field of campaigns of women, a showdown with the UK.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates of the American fieldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually display a memorable performance but Bam (27) said that she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition, and they are identical in their group with the British on the first place, which were undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two teams of each group will gain the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed, the strong Dutch will take some longer out of the path that leads to the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game will go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising vortex in their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games over the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey tennis racket (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham became an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to contact the things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working day in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprising and kept the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, then moved into the center and entered the ball in the gate to get an 2-0 guidance to the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Same as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but as good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and evasive, a rapid relay on competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch himself would be a burning rod, which is enough to protect the swimmers for the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot listen to the TV, read a paper or listen to your neighbors during the queue in the waiting time without playing Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers and the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a pair of women with dimples, could definitely be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even fat.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, Lake Forest, California, fights for the Olympic trampoline with gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me direct your attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years saw that many that I had asked, did not know that there is an Olympic class.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US athletes sent for competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline and had to win a athletes until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping on a certain outdoor swimming pool, partly because it sounds like an enlightened ear for a Clownsschule as those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert but only a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end, but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must take a number of falling movements (turning, Hreal and Saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official Olympics by execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go on in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go and return, down and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast another great goal: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel about looking at these games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she picks up, seemingly heavid like an astronaut, goes down, then down effortlessly back.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves enter into the distance, just the dreaming, elegant uplift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and finals of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end as part of a nightfall bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably survive in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the increase of consciousness is only achieved by the attackers and object of male athletes, as it recently announced the male US gymnast, according to The Wall Street Journal, - then Mr. Dooley awaiting his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">A generation protests in Ethiopia, Long, a member of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, political changes in Ethiopia call for the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protesters during clashes were killed by police forces.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the wealthiest countries in Africa, making a solid foster of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the Government shattered the country and continued to spread out more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and the fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on fifty armed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with rods, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians together to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in major pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum train in Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to progress through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," "" "Seyoum Teshome said, a lecturer in the Ethiopian Mountains." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use until the litters handle in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this tender, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden that were more or less forced to use turbulence and could be armed again." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of ageing have now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones were increasingly frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies, conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were all assembled at protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since an emergency, the Amharas, who come from Äthopia mainly to Christian people, exploded in politics and economy as they carried out the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is just changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate with a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and the military, in secret services, and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly enticing to make early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "in the current regime there is no lack of skill" "", "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively opaque grounds to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern Sardinia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such a riot in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the analysis of the analysis, the government seems to be stolen from the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months, and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure, such as the new pendulum train, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants held in Gondar, an amharic city, led by Tigray and hatred in the social media as usual.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests could bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights above the neighboring Somalia, even if it has been telling that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded on ISIS "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday, that his campaign would recover, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not meant seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "this clarification designed new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans as it is capable of communicating and understandable to the American public." ""</seg>

<seg id="5">After spending the narrowing during a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump hurried back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews he meant totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to weaken something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism directed at Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Referring to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>

<seg id="17">However, I think it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even corrosive sound, since its reversals are further declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was released on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempted to apologize for his provocative remarks, he accused his critics to understand his sayings or to understand his humour incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is approaching the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trump joke have brought his loyal competitors to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in an CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani thus said to the correctness of Mr. Trump statements, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backfirsts, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister, ISIS was allowed to spread over ISIS in spreading it to aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and threw them on every one of his words and to be biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor" "" "television experts who try to understand and said," "" "You can't." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">A lively bustling cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new deb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When it offered a customer to provide money for a new outshell, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps of the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages like capers and autious onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is natural bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café offers no beer more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez, he said that he noticed a stained power at old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived early in Williamsburg and attended the verb regularly.</seg>

<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal gets its usual order today, but sometimes he is changing the Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he won't be a grounding, that the soap business has taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the cold-powered coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we will go down to their offer," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish people Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>

<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>

<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expanded to a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new deb is enough to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground, when the café was closed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland mostly come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland we got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland-shark floating around the North Atlantic River, in an hour, an average of 1,220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it reaches, the five meter long beast accelerates a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lengthy lifestyle seems to be a patiscept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate of Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "the Max Planck Institute for demographic research by the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspects long that Greenland will become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are hard to watch, eventually they live mainly in the Eismeer from the most sparsely populated coastal areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland scientists accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timepentempo adows them as they equip six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">The prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a animal found researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they chase sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the Eismeeres and look for Kadaver, made from higher water layers after down torches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied at 28 Greenland, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method of sharks of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, which will not be renewed in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticle.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests try to tow larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the lens of the lens contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapon, so it is likely to celebrate his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all major Greenland-pigs had normal carbon-14 amounts being formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an 493-centimetre-long Greenland age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters was even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females then get offspring when they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign one age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably determined on the threshold of the sexually mature stood and its age of 156 years was determined, Greenland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries period.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane lees live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, was caught in his bacon on the neck a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, animals often runs on sparkles living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and alps slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In cold water warm to keep warm, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on how many descendants as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist scrubbing." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyesal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next Romwallers of all ministers in the arena, two years ago, the Oberministered Round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were tested and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where he was on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburger Münster in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenbedrooms made the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the evening, Abbot Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration of St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by train at the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Muenster beloved wife, and so the pilgrimage was taken away from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short stimulus with various prayers, songs and scripting.</seg>
<seg id="10">But on the way, Minis was making a song to sing chapels, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a customized pilgrim's book.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner's last night in the team-team Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role of anchoring his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy gave himself to Eigen and made the legend haughed to return home from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy claimed the fifth of six olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after taking place in March at the World Championships in London despite the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hinder appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained when they saw potential in the shallots which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victors - and Skinner placed an olympic event in the qualification round, but in the standard round, the New Zealanders triumphed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinds returned to his turn, but Kenny brought the team forward and skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a major part of transformation in the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and it Kenny and especially Skinner allow to stop the tempo.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed a olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys, Hindes gave rise to the path that he was looking for a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and no objection of England rivals came.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such a good victory.</seg>

<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days at the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated the victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a apparently holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The coming of Hoy is equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which will begin today and will go over three days.</seg>

<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942 am.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today, the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the race, with Wiggins with safety in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought against the qualification yesterday when officials call him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective Women's Competition, tomorrow continued and finished, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world of world-time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a cup of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bulbingings as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite then, as the legendary call GBs, who reaches its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few Euro lovers can buy the devices even on the Internet, but they come somehow from the Stoneage of the internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hannover as "office in the west-format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that time a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received by fax was also the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even if quaint slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen were found.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 392 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could highlight in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled in Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market dominates the market today, all of which came later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold around 1.4 billion devices, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover of the units is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the well running shops of the countless app vendors and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone has now become an entire industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World to introduce the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communications, easy to use by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The triumphal march of Apple began, today is the iPhone's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry dominated the market, they had to see.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now the following is Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-evident 20 years after his invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German player now looks onto his mobile phone for 88 times a day.</seg>

<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the transition to company attacks were terrifying quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active in the computer of an victim, it is looking for long changed files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - usually in the form of Cryptoothing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users found the personal photo database on the game, companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which still stands out.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to cancel the business activities completely, with one case people were in danger of danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of health care.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Don't pay, you just promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to refuse in the process of perpetrators in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user surface and get in contact with the blackheads and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their offerings by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, send freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "and private people will be redeemed to payments from a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to replicate their data unencrypted." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware extortion, hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building kit to the real blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by using the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adaption tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then search for further hackers in order to spread the freshly sold software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one is logically in one of the forums, buying the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inferred calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"typically, the criminals carry spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, Ransomware's risk is known for many companies that safeguard their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust ransomware to assert ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful development, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential for damages depending on the type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "too, the perpetrators will have completely new goals on the Internet of the grain." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrating security researcher how they could get with the Internet associated thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a derart blocked heating could definitely be a ransom.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you sleep eternally around, at night you wake up for hours, in the morning it is far off to think about sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one-quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanent when not recovering.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many factors underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Flensor and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand landmarks, however, is the Insomnie, so a single and diarrhea disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board member of the German domestic association with practice in the lower Saxon Varel, are very inadequate and inadequate, "Jens Wagenknecht, says Jens Wagenknecht, in the German Civil Society.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or tolerate factors can also be used, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep problem expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common with a depression" "", "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are mentioning each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts blurily, about everyday problems and care, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week should not sleep well and the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is smitten, tired, undressed, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily adorable, has stimulation fluctuations or physical discomfort like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural behavioral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Still in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, are scarcely stressed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in a sleep laboratory, physician for instance at snoring with respiratory purgations, when suffering from illness, or if you cannot find the cause of a flow disturbance, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just make no lunch break," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After wired one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one has a nose sunglasses, chest strap and an antennae at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also shows a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get problems get into the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of stud bolts where you can use for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, not sleeping long in bed, don't sleep to sleep, don't get to watch alcohol at the clock - then you begin to count immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrouded the police three weeks ago, closed parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94.</seg>

<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers led by the lever of sympathy and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertained in late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood, an elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who grew up here three children, mainly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood, they share the worries from rising mides and ventrification.</seg>

<seg id="16">The ditch, which is the Berlin inner senator and the police between the occupants and the neighbors, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the native dwellings are already a long time for pine: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the whole Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police force, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become the magnets for tourists and polling liner from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former home occupiers share their maxim.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can also be felt at the rentals, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in raised discs or freshly knitted facades that have been drained with grains.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors could consider that as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by the crime: offences like body injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make nondamage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next 17 years beside the controversial 94, uncertainty can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, she is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who certainly did not have.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars don't give it directly to the Rigaer longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that local residents returned to their streets: from the police, politics and media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: "" "" endless new buildings in the former buildings that displace old inhabitants. "" "</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not as good as well," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can absolutely not be guenous."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone has never listened to?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration at all sides, including the police and the roommates.</seg>
<seg id="37">For signatures that are annoyed by color bombers, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the hood and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who are going on should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with pre-name have asked, not to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officers for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical team supports the team of management by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, workers for refugees, administration, authorities and who else blends.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here who has an earring Wollmilchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less sprawling rather than rather donating on the variety of wish tasks - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a management expert with a talent for languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, just an eiving wool melnau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle believes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is organization, work with people on-site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent point for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle is assisting honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the water road</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem since some time to find apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratum to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been a very difficult time for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">The management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, you rely on private dwellings, so do not work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communities need to be erroned as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So there will be new containers in the Wasp area.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Point of view is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm Bleib, it is internship placements, training courses, one-euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be undressed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, done charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the municipal authority leads to a positive influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a self-rigation feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with the locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also you can jump and volunteer here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long run of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it will take, and they can bribe bridging the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone at some point, he can't help anybody in Urbach, will not work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is also problems," "" "people are honest," "" "people in which nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did they fear radicalization, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says quite clearly, "what manors may call naive." but the chance of a woman could not exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are the fear that the assassination attempt it completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main - and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants coming to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we would like," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already trained to integrate the previous people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
