Obama received Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abi@@ lizing measures in the Middle East .
but it is said about the conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the argu@@ ed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the Israeli sett@@ lements of Israel and raises the consent of the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear program was wor@@ sen@@ ing through the Obama &apos;s Iranian nuclear programme .
in March , Netanyahu , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of U.S. Congress , had held a controversial speech against Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting had turned to Israel with reference to the time for the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call he was shot to have shot his friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb also told the police that he shot and shot his friend , and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was so important to pray that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was alive and probably alive , and he said that family contact of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house the officials found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I had to und@@ o , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was backed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb , who had built in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled some 300 miles to the factory , where he was shot and killed at the door to his office , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford reported that Universal employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has taken the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers resort to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , like what students and staff whom had known him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er died where he died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in one book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ricul@@ um comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lines to solve trou@@ bles@@ ome behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised the Lamb , said that he was a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being something wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he has any health problem .
during this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; latest changes in the employment policy of the university won that the doctorate , who had worked so hard for the Lamb , had no guarantee for an automatic move to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , police found Lam@@ bs subsequently , when he entered the Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas again .
before being arrested , Lamb stran@@ ded himself alone with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner , Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran even in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , under@@ lined geography and pedagog@@ y .
he did his doctorate in the spring in pedagog@@ y .
one of the long term girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla Hair@@ dres@@ ston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when they met together by joint friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was then the s@@ laugh@@ tering of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls woke up there when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ ban subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ure were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who was living with them in the brick house , bor@@ dering a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police stated that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en over his daughter .
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met him as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail took up two years ago both in a summer @-@ year @-@ fair .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
she was a nurse , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and at the time entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illumin@@ ated bar near G@@ auti@@ er said that he had Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ ish Night at night . September last time , having finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ asp@@ ame in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no signs of something that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we stayed at the premises and were j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ term seminar program and speci@@ alizes in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student &apos;s Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people held at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Memorial and sang during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be included on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ a .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Books Emily Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb shot the emergency when he identified David , and that Lamb in his emergency came out as his wife , but there was no indication that the two have ever been married .

back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .

UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; general Secretary Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of permanent conflict , and more weapons will merely make violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader again calls all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite , unite and merge negotiations to fin@@ alise a political solution .

8 Ren@@ ate values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to cut him out as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how several rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump at the top of the p@@ olls in search of p@@ olls , has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to look seriously at what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course it is still too soon in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that during this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had taken leadership to the Asc@@ ent Herman Hill , and none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external side groups such as Je@@ ther Bus Terminal Super PAC and the conservative daily Club for Growth now detect tre@@ umps having stamina and start to flow through their dollar to overthrow him .
here are some actual exchange values that indicate that the estate business Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
res@@ ins popularity values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac set in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; pleased &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is the nearest thing in mind ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans tend to have the right temper@@ ament for a President , ABC News / Washington Post in Monday .
the same number applies in the first selection state of the nation , the federal state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ant say that his tem@@ per does not settle in the White House , ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they place their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters keep track of being real .
if they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say that after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of the ten of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters do not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , a large number of GO@@ P voters will show a plau@@ sible campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans accum@@ ulate another , Tr@@ ump hits him almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field probably contribute to tre@@ umps , while the anti @-@ dump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ didates diff@@ use .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most of all rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ inees , dump the majority support .
he sp@@ un Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of edge Paul , John Ka@@ em and Chris Christie scored 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would win the business@@ man with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a narrow majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change my mind .
46 percent said they would leave the door open to move to other candidates .
nonetheless , tre@@ umps is strongest in the moment of the other out@@ sider , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind , twice as often as crude for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with b@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump named immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ape from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was immigration and fishing in the public dis@@ course of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ sions of Tr@@ ump is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will not damage the new@@ com@@ er@@ ical efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but according to the new ABC / Post Survey carried out Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they must match b@@ ump at issues of immigration .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will apparently do Donald Tr@@ ump as well .
fru@@ stration at the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son has meanwhile gained some half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , especially their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post they rather want a political out@@ sider to be someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress with 54 percent of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
the most expensive compound located here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg : with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a wheelchair costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally restricted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter most costs .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ ds in Munich are not really little .
but unlike Germany &apos;s top housing , the price will be like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service company Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German sites , with square prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros . - per square metre .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is certainly not at the top here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two double go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky winner by Thomas Müller made the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olymp@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus , and then ran it .
a sovereign in the Champions @-@ League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have dreamed a dream start in the wit@@ ches &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off match in the Champions League of the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Dou@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ H + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start to the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally win the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his November 28 , in the Champions League to the Bavaria @-@ leadership of the rapid assistance of olymp@@ ic go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a slim down shot of the world champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t be under@@ estim@@ ating it , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s Word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated perception without shine .
Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them club clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , there also stum@@ bled Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ e@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , would not want to be the next victim .
they went brave fight , but with her offen@@ sive efforts , she often went into works .
the attacks were led to the left side of the Left Opposition to Lin@@ ks@@ ke Douglas Costa , which was rarely confirmed by Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made more luck than his fl@@ ank drawn from the right se@@ mit@@ one in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion scored the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct action , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
though Bavaria moved into the dominant play , Pir@@ an@@ aus could use ne@@ c@@ cess@@ es .
but on door@@ ke@@ en Manuel Neuer was off@@ ences .
as soon as he shot a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ ins ( 5@@ 6th ) .
first , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola told David Al@@ aba with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ viar , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup player gave a green light only after the final practice , said Sport@@ s@@ man Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something else this is v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola even decided on his first change when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter made Müller one step further .
prior to the game , it had arrived at the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ ale .
after a smaller group of avoided Bavaria fans in their viewers &apos; blo@@ c had looked at the trailer of hosts Pir@@ an@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with whi@@ ps against the Munich p@@ endants .
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was injured and transported out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdam long term study near .
the good news : for leaving a risk , the risk drops quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this emerges from the long term study of an international research team , among which several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
when compared to non @-@ smokers the risk of losing their teeth was pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 sheets higher .
the scientists had observed more than 2@@ 3,@@ 300 participants .
the causes of tooth loss are cav@@ ities and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises its DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss can therefore go back on frequent gum disease with smokers .
smoking is not clear , although smoking is increased the risk of c@@ aries .
for people listening to smoking , they could reduce their risk within a short time , &quot; the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained First @-@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
they must be persu@@ aded to be non @-@ smo@@ ker , said study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and j@@ ars and leads to our knowledge as well as good oral health to high age .
more than 20 percent of the population in Germany are afflicted by tooth in@@ som@@ nia , aged 65 to 74 years , divided the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study also supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on lef@@ to@@ ver from the Sp@@ ät@@ eb@@ ke
for the repeated time , on the right bank of Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne , archaeological finds have been made .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum were excav@@ ated by skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , the museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans are in search of so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the Cologne city district , the museum is always considered as a specialized office for Archae@@ ological floor care .
in the third construction stage of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists now become a fifth one .
from text@@ books , we have already known that a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained in Trier .
beside remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
to att@@ est the dispute over the planned trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private bl@@ asting facilities for groups between corpor@@ ations and the states should thus be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to considerably more traditional food in its function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström explained to &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de intend to introduce the proposal as a European bar@@ gaining position into the US trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP must develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform of the current arbit@@ ration sets in particular that the EU states and the U.S. have jointly chosen an independent judge for a new investment tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should originate from EU , USA and third countries .
the second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to rise up against urine .
until now the processing encomp@@ assing one of the judges , a ob@@ jection to their judgments , did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commenting on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work according to a International Investment Court .

delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
alongside him , a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the shy @-@ looking fol@@ ks@@ is recorded by the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , approximately 40 people , has been taken up of Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places he always draws upon the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and art @-@ arranged songs report .
where they arose and what it looks like , in his homeland .
of course Stev@@ ens re@@ members himself as a wonderfully creative ag@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear wise composed songs that can blend beautifully close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it arises the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a hidden series : each of the 50 states of the states should be occupied in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine is already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and makes a positive expectations .
so Stev@@ ens is reduced here .
live will meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians live back to the series in New York .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is published in 2005 .
exu@@ ber@@ ant about ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American b@@ ill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the music media listed in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic refer@@ ral pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth extraordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats , and plays with every effect and rever@@ ence .
since the smaller club , the stage shows are ring@@ ing here as a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ forehead b@@ anding and large fluores@@ cent stages .
at present Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is stepp@@ ing up as part of a five member band in Germany .
in the dark , ham@@ burger made more !
first of all theatres , it works mainly the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are banned in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens re@@ leg@@ ated Stev@@ ens return to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without creating a word to the audience , the band plays excellent musicians with the wide enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and you can eliminate the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens is modest , acou@@ stically attracted few older songs and is finally dis@@ like applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings with tension since his election is expected
the new Labour Party Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n aims to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions , and David Cameron worked for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first six given questions about noon , with what his performance is likely to be tested from the media and the Labour Parliament .
he called &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guide , because she became a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ qu@@ ettes for his appointment as well as his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , postpon@@ ed during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands in the focus of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ tful and respec@@ tful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , talked in the BBC Two @-@ night program , he says to the Labour leader , the national an@@ them should sing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team and they were called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s pron@@ oun@@ cements in the position on the European Union and the limit in winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , in order to put Labour in order to remove all the idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of employment and pensions , said that the party &quot; is very clear that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he became T@@ ory boss , last decade over the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in the Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policies , says he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the qu@@ ay of the Prime Minister is at a fron@@ tal , and that he is subjected to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Minister of Economic Affairs is represented when he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally re@@ hold the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the hospital , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove themselves from politics in style of a &quot; cas@@ hier theatre &quot; that is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted he has failed .
when she was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the ships with the prime minister was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the decision and his position among its par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed , they have become a caric@@ ature and require far reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the Po@@ und dropped out of data by showing an increase in wages in the United Kingdom &apos;s pay@@ roll . parallel to this , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal sequence SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and inv@@ alu@@ able in the time of interest adv@@ ances in 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the US $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ovice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry @-@ Shar@@ es were encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury est@@ ates Rich@@ em@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ens latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - improved growth .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ CO@@ RE increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said he took $ 2.5 billion in cash sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , while with a 4.3 % decrease , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had asser@@ ted its assessment for the companies &quot; rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % , after the year @-@ off company announced a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages tend to end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will be the higher labour costs with his company , he says .
the costs could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ proof campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - decay
met@@ a is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local foods vendors and build the IG@@ A brand through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough as shops , distributed in IG@@ A shops , and shop owners who sell exclusive tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected to publish more details of his defense strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will go through its annual investors strategy .
it stands much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores make up and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states generate .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries will take away and all existing actors , but mainly independent retail sales .
a report published by Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retailers worldwide could lose 360 million dollars per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs might cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , cash shares lose market share in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan discovered that IG@@ A pro@@ cu@@ rement are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase revenue in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told him the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business in Melbourne that metal is likely to disappear within a decade .
cash cash declined to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash won in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s to feed and food retailers that have approx . 1.200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating loss reduction on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler fights and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to boost sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A single @-@ retailers to improve their shops by faster @-@ growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and loading recovery programmes to Elan must be put and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is rather deser@@ ved praise to be a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ved to view the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise for his own behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got through the not@@ orious analysis of C@@ yr@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA to the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fier@@ y qualification round in Cincinnati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison could be separated by the arbit@@ rators , taking Harrison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have sm@@ elling the child . &quot;
as he was last seen , how he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp wra@@ cked a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , it was def@@ icient at the Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single lane behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I gr@@ ate myself is the fact that Th@@ an@@ asi was put down a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was broken up a ra@@ cket , while he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken down a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision that C@@ yr@@ gios starts with the important role @-@ decision , which k@@ icks off on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; than the right one for all , but he guarantees the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term .
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick made a quick way to the Ascension , where@@ of people like Feder@@ er and Murray will have made a lot of bad faul@@ ts , and we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions , which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Emer@@ gency , joins the Border , with@@ draws refugees
Hungary explains the Not@@ ary and lowered the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the time trying to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos did not follow the border when hundreds of migrants responded to re@@ members in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land .
the people who fled from violence had fled for an unknown time in a h@@ ass@@ ment on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations climbed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aper@@ tures the fron@@ tier ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out charges against the Hungarian forces police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some directed from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary sent us back while passing through Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must be held in talks with Brussels and other countries over the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c on a strict meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who have taken refuge in the survi@@ ving Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would involve further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit at the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the passing crisis of the continent .
but Hungary won &apos;t put his hopes upon an early action of Brussels or his neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency room held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave much authority to combat the crisis so that they could accelerate and accelerate political asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said in the meantime that his country has also been building a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having ended up a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban however insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have rights in conflict with other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which went into force around midnight , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher pen@@ alties for the traff@@ ickers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass mig@@ rations , the Hungarian Government states Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs &apos;s rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but journalists from Associated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs on days for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already entered into the country deeper .
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes of crimes against new laws .
authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
the Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning , two of the seven fron@@ tier over@@ passes with Serbia , after a train with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos re@@ jects the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd in order to push there .
around 20 succeeded to get involved , but thousands were staying out .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway link between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s head to the margin ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins across the ground .
Clinton now backed the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is at second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den not yet announced whether he can@@ di@@ ded for the presidential term , support 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presi@@ dency .
more than five months before the pre @-@ election elections , most democratic voters say it too early to say that their opinions determined those candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost some gain of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved a few wins .
Clinton holds a huge margin for women and slaughter , but these ar@@ ches have decreased .
her support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders can only be returned here with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons has been ev@@ apor@@ ated with democratic voters below 50 years , and they and S@@ anders are at the same level now .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage over the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was ahead of his two @-@ digit margin ahead of the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presi@@ dency say that they would support him with Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and 15 percent would only support them , because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic .
the views are stronger and the ones that currently not support Hillary - only about one quarter would enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters predi@@ ct that they would ban Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters all over the candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters are question@@ ed in an open question , she is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter was also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to address the problems and the voting is quoted as well .
as the vice @-@ president would throw a potential for the Presi@@ dential government in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - even though a third belie@@ veth that he should not do it .
if the democratic elec@@ torate must be asked by the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
of Clin@@ tons Tra@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be so different to his other choice .
decide bias , not to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head increased his way ahead of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters face the chance of winning the election as a candidate , but has dropped by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den has by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that considers it &quot; sel@@ ectable , &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , by the question of what is more important in candidates , the Democratic voters call questions about the voters .
similarly , in the last month , no single national candidate or potential candidate for that voters of the elections can be unacceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important traits for voters of the party &apos;s op@@ pres@@ ets .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the leader among the three candidates , during Clin@@ tons &quot; strength is the guiding .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as they say ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic voters of the elections , in general , see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters do not believe S@@ anders .
as asking questions , Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the term of Foreign Affairs , most of the Democratic voters of the pres@@ election are pleased with their declaration of the matter , saying that their opinions will not affect their opinions .
but there is another story in the American public altogether .
half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation as only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their common opinions of Clinton , even though 36 percent said that her opinion was deteri@@ or@@ ated by her .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 that predi@@ ct that their beliefs are much worse .
although Clinton is considered honest by the voters of their party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent do they see than tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of people who are eligible to vote are not tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership .
among the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush viol@@ ated the best of hon@@ esty .
a majority does not look much better than honestly , but as at Car@@ son many do not have any opinions about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters of the presidential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to Prussia &apos;s survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
meanwhile , half of the voters turn their support in the new survey , and others lose their support dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in big number . the support increases by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate in the last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son was in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son works well with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass himself on rep@@ ubli@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , governor John Ka@@ es , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins , governor of Scott Walker , who is lowest in the last month , and from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also pointed out Tr@@ ump to Car@@ son .
looking forward to a record in the last week of Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side enh@@ anc@@ akes for former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son has ap@@ ologi@@ zed to put j@@ umps in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , last Saturday , during a campaign of campaigns in Iowa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , a bathing beach bar reaches a trip to the Mediterranean to still find hot water .
a bathroom in the North and Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some do not go to the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea last week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
however , beach temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches temperatures up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top , 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood concluded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student during a ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ous ritu@@ als a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder acc@@ lam@@ ent for five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch ritual in September 2013 and stopped its transport into the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
civil servants said that he had been stra@@ ined with a 30 pound bag full of sand weigh@@ ed and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to strike above a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call upon the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , national president of the Brotherhood , said Poli@@ cia Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started hiding , and set the welfare of Brotherhood in principle on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ons@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been repeated with bl@@ unt injury to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the sh@@ ic@@ ans each year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this step is very important .
a County Grand Jury found an indictment about murder of the third count of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and education of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make responsible for the parties involved , but if there is an organisation , which - officially or in@@ officially , we will also draw these to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College is prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood gained its affili@@ ation towards the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate is , and the land@@ marks will get into sha@@ king , yields for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
especially the history of the economy offers very low instructions for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest increase and lasts for 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor as the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank has pointed out so fier@@ c@@ ely that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates , but rather at the time period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end , the market participants could see that all the excitement because of an interest rate might be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at the capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we expect not the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on low level to lead to seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here , a historical trend , based on historical trends , is to react to some areas of the economy :
as seen by the market during the last month , rate of interest rates of interest rates can be vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase is hit , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems there seems a trend that assets will be acknowledged from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps reflected again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study , what had happened after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly in over the past 35 years - roughly 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike , almost flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , then back to normal margin after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , then back to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss station strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur in the increases cycle and the margin begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates are often encouraging .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some circumstances which could not advance before and could accelerate recession .
the remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of its lowest point for an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 rate of interest rates there has only been twice the nominal growth of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect that it will last and wait for the third quarter to the Atlanta F@@ ed at just 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a frag@@ ile economic setting can be ris@@ ky and throw the question on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market participants have made themselves a rate of interest rate on the F@@ ed , and all eyes were set at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC might be an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading will only have a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing momentum continued to grow and pre @-@ prescri@@ p@@ low rise very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest ; the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so hi@@ ther@@ to 74 months .
the in@@ comes was also vol@@ at@@ ile when the market gains a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course .
at bonds , yields seem to change as soon as the first raise / reduction in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in the returns of leng@@ thier and shorter bonds and lead to a bend in the curve .
highly interest bonds often result in such a climate better yields , although &quot; we are still war@@ y to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ In@@ come yst@@ ok , in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are a few evidence that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit lines have expanded and the vol@@ at@@ ility have increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that wra@@ pping the larger part of their business activity in the US will benefit , if interest rates rise and local products will be more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debt become worse , because an increasing dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond to extremely positive , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the pre @-@ interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their stocks have also exceeded their counter@@ parts of low quality , respectively 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest are losing the most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit from the rising money outside the pure shar@@ ehol@@ ding .
as@@ par@@ agus and profits can even be seen due to higher yields , even if experts of different opinions will take place as quickly as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , &quot; says Member of Parliament &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham
con@@ doms Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stupid &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is increasingly unlikely to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was only hosting The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dami@@ en Collins had attacked the Voice of The Voice and said that it was not so original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster , to prove that he does not do what the broad@@ c@@ aster does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ doms - Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; Dam@@ um@@ me &quot; and increasingly isn &apos;t to be distinguished from its commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; da@@ zz@@ ling &quot; - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you only do im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC general director dismissed the charges back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 set wide in front of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and expl@@ aining the public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is an engagement for live music and playing music that really is un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and commissioned new works , I &apos;m really important for you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British gave less than classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that fell under fire during the hearing on the selection of culture , media , and sport for the commercial ri@@ vals to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory Euro MP Dami@@ en Collins has grab@@ bed The Voice to the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly mark@@ edly ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced on special BBC @-@ fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added ; he wants the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stud &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it star@@ es the next time a fun series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of other series of The Voice in the Future or lend money to the pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet @-@ sales increased in August at the longest and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of the major shopping streets in Britain have turned into cab@@ al cities .
however , experts predi@@ ct that there are reports that online sales will stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures will only show seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures will only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G selling complex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales increased more than three years ago as a purch@@ aser , with their mobile phones to buy .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this will be comm@@ uted , and we may be able to see that growth decreases .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for nar@@ rowing temperatures .
experts believe that buyers will return their purchases from this event , each succe@@ eding in November .
last year , Sch@@ arte describes the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some vend@@ or sites attacked .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer were fighting for bar@@ gains , buyers will keep the buyer from doing .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was that £ 5 covers a little more than £ 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now conducted via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the Mecca in Mecca on the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 massac@@ res are carried through the streets of Muslims in Mecca .
Saudi Arabia takes part of the collapse of the huge , Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health reported that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane pl@@ ung@@ ed

the bodies were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King of the family Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which also left behind a penalty of 3@@ 94 .
the corp@@ ses of 29 managers who were killed , as a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ kas , were carried by the streets .
under the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage when the crane was pl@@ ung@@ ed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch drive to Mecca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , king Salman , the Bin Laden group should not stop the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arm of the sick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency in the news agency reported not this detail , but said that the company &apos;s guidance must be out@@ la@@ wed .
at the beginning of this week , Salman moved to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ che@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that occurred later this month .
the Bin Laden group has no statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree even re@@ loaded the group because of non @-@ current security measures , since it has not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a huge son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials admitted that 1 million cents ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed workers and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries get half this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe paid off
this leads to a further 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim to cra@@ ze at craftsmen .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales are nationwide
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City head correspon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons carry its hamm@@ ers and brush to the benefit of qualified Eastern European art@@ is@@ ans who perform works in their home ,
if you &apos;re sent to cope with a hammer or a brush to painting walls , apparently you belong to a minority .
for British increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans to carry home @-@ down jobs within their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , who offer services to low prices , be ob@@ sol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops offering you to the art@@ is@@ ans and close the 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men exceed the men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to put this stronger towards equilibri@@ um .
basically , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed on the head of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also has its top team structured to reflect a compar@@ ative number of males and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied about 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher filed a decline in half @-@ year profit and net sales after the group re@@ marked the cost of shops .
because of its trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new stores .
function of A@@ im / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt regional court , two officials of the Austrian volleyball Vice Minister A@@ ich / DO@@ B will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ grace .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of off@@ ences .
in May , he was acquitted by the accus@@ ation .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the Public Prosecutor of Robert Ri@@ ffel , in 2006 , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ all@@ ised the accused in 2006 to 2011 of club accounts , which they were able to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
it yields approximately 400@@ ,000 Euros as a result .
Sports officials are also charged with financial dies .
this fact , President Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired from this fac@@ ulty .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
opposed to the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence appe@@ aled to no time an asset .
the sport@@ s@@ men only had b@@ anning fixed damages and the sport@@ s@@ club that they had spent between 1982 and 2011 and spent some time and money that they brought out of the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va lived around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue to lock the club or block away ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread pract@@ ised pro@@ mon@@ ary of finance .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot the money , laid out our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it can only be done no debts .
the payment of the allowance for allowance for the draft prosecution had been made retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the commission damages only years later , namely in 2003 , when a Plus on the account has been paid off .
in that way , package tours and not detailed bookings seem to be explained , the former spokes@@ man explained the proceedings .
the accounts and au@@ ditions managed to manage the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdraw@@ als for the Association have not been detailed in detail , asked the judge .
the association is not interested in the details of financial bund@@ ling , it is important only to reduce debt freedom , so the answer .
when in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account against one of the abuse proceedings .
those were set@@ backs , they declared the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not aware of the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
then the question@@ ed no answer .
then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public pro@@ secutor in the room .
the accused would have been informed , just@@ ifying the officials .
this transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why poll@@ ut@@ ations ? , judge and prosecution wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant explained that he was not in agreement with this form@@ ulation , because the club was never a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from the tail@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said the function@@ ary , he never had a cent content , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he was charged $ 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher than he added .
the accused were unable to report exact documents for the early years .
these are according to a working order in which all of it has been judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage even had a second def@@ endant .
all Beh@@ eb@@ bles are put in cash , with this he had to go to the Bank &apos;s home market to lead , he explained in his statement .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard we@@ ars additional 30,000 jobs
in addition to the three years ongoing project exploitation , the computer carrier terri@@ ers will shed additional jobs at the increasing development of the company .
the adjusting positions in the US computer vendors of Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to excav@@ ate the mining of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its company store .
this means that costs were saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars incur@@ red from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed .
in the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ shares increased 2.3 percent .
the California Palo Alto group , with printers from California , is now sp@@ inning on : so the computer and print business will still be bund@@ led in a new society - apart from the benefit of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business steep are to be recorded on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appointing PC @-@ cl@@ ause as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after his services used the second @-@ largest PC manufacturer on the phone .
in the third quarter of July , sales of both PC and printers rose by 11.@@ 5 per cent .
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
thereby the revenues decreased in 15 of the 16 quarters .
HP is responsible for the changes in the industry with a split and massive adjusting action .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only rapidly re@@ acted that customers buy more smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and get more and more shopping online .
the restructuring plans will take a total breakdown of around 55@@ ,000 jobs in total .
conflicts : a majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers participating in combat missions in Iraq would largely rise to rejection : 54 per cent believed in favour of 35 percent .
the fact that other countries fly against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
the conflict is opposed , 24 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the Syrian people of power , Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents reject as much as 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent could not decide .

after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th international automobile exhibition entitled &quot; mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the Frankfurt International Motor Show .
the organizers of the V@@ DA auto association count as early as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : rebellion to the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police led at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water authorities against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the stop of violence on the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the fron@@ tier .
behind it , a police line was formed and a water designer was ready behind the police officer .
40 to 50 refugees began to cast stones , stones and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first jumped in dis@@ continuous pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was contra@@ dic@@ ated in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn something .
a pregnant and apparently last woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , they cried .
other refugees ble@@ ed together and suffered under breathing .
the press Officer of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Not@@ ices
the world watches when the U.S. not@@ ices were on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision , whether for the first time ever since almost a decade , interest is lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were inter@@ viewed by Reuters found that a little more than half , the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0,@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it is seven years ago since F@@ ed earned interest on NULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a central bank trans@@ forms the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate a low inflation rate .
however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances .
she has warned the markets to rise to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death of Death at Delta State University conclu@@ des :
&quot; &quot; &quot; following the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi in Monday morning - before he later killed his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ annon Lamb put a note in order to say that he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first murder and wanted to make it aw@@ k@@ ward , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science at Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency center that police officers had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody will become anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably going to be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller on his behalf , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his committ@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I had to und@@ o . &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb reached the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no evidence , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , who had been married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but made friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ ure had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; at the ground .
he said Pr@@ ent@@ ure was &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
heart@@ y worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , that was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ ure .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , that had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb called relatives on Monday in order to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police took him away on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb put his car on his side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed herself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD student from Delta State University in early 2015 , as his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood is at the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a couple of st@@ ress@@ ful years .
he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia in 2001 and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor has also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned to drug ad@@ di@@ es .
all this certainly requires his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group by
the Lufthansa plans a large group of companies .
as a result , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in a better organisation .
150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide will cost the division &apos;s sales in the workplace .
there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa aims to build its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the schedule of Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of approximately € 500 million a year from cost and earnings sy@@ ner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa sector is no longer available to the passenger business in the future .
the budget line Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
the board team at Chef Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings by Karl Ulrich Oster@@ mann .
the new re@@ actor also highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the group will be competing against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 associates had a strong company complex .
the airline operates under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations for the German Association of Police ( VC ) are scheduled for negotiations on this Thursday after the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union with him .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement regime for pilots .
cockpit wants to come &quot; rapid results &quot; a year with a projected record result .
the conflict between union and airline has led to several strikes in the past months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilot , the pilot concept is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it looks ahead , that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is pre@@ emp@@ tied to the Group &apos;s budget line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for many months because of double fra@@ cture
the Champions @-@ League @-@ defeat of Manchester had a dual fre@@ action of its True B@@ one at the Champions @-@ League defeat by Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while defending the left def@@ ender of the left and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give up hope that Shaw is able to play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw break into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and necessary oxygen before he was put to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a dual color correction and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and operated in Manchester .
it is awful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the cabin , he had a oxygen massage .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a dual in@@ action , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped an Red Card and the hanging of a mo@@ ist .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , who is the arbit@@ rator , has not pen@@ alised the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al thought that Italian refer@@ ee had wrong .
they can judge for themselves when I say that an El@@ f@@ m and a red card were mat@@ ured .
it was a very worst attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your message . words cannot describe how bad I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;m coming back stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
result @-@ related : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PS@@ V
the British def@@ ender has an added inc@@ en@@ tive in France to recover from the European Championship in France up to the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phillip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of violation the place leaves , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the FIFA World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury that isn &apos;t good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly doing it . I &apos;m so sorry about that .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a fe@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ aller .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite child@@ r@@ ens book decided to call himself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a tough choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my kids , for it seems always to give an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph telling the action of the book instead describes a summary of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; amid@@ st the w@@ alled city Th@@ ames @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , there is a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to see his desire to see a real tree , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if it would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text read by Cameron is partly sum@@ med up as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is on the website of Th@@ ames @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , there is a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is inf@@ ant to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron can trust the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy hears about the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ ious creatures , &quot; which is spoken in the name of trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text had probably come from the Camer@@ ons Choice Office .
super@@ structure confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons has been delivered , there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the English team &apos;s exclusion , but it is still hard
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when one has chosen the cad@@ res , which England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks site is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the battle @-@ list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will wear no scars from 2012 , only a young @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown number on testing planes , an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th being produced from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
at his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ min@@ et@@ eers are targeted to results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ re , but he had control of his own fate .
if he knock out other runs for Yorkshire , another chance arrives .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not bring so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question , how much time a test ammer wins , is difficult to set his mark , is difficult .
Ly@@ re got seven opportunities - as Sam Rob@@ son got nine in front of him - while Nick Sti@@ ton added nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance to return home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation , which one could rise , was that England first sat Jonathan Bran@@ t in the Caribbean - but as ly@@ th being in high class - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is in her heart and he is a striking that I really cher@@ ish .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eers , which we saw at Yorkshire very early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us much .
he must at least receive the same opportunities as those before him , but of course , it depends on the United Arab Emirates status in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of trying to beat the Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would get an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four quota , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and that left @-@ h@@ anders have already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket Player .
Mo@@ een may did not do his job for his County ? Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire but he &apos;s not a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team colleague Justin Long@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he performed as an Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ uns , and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly can see his statistics - on average 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , who raises her hands and the trainer chose to be youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ ne , the author from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful usage in the setup .
I always felt he &apos;s created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin , even if the messages appear in line with what they appear before .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with that .
some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be taken with mild heart .
Bre@@ xit @-@ camp ( Bre@@ xit , Great Britain out of the EU ) could gain access when the economy reaches a fle@@ ck device until 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ wi@@ eld re @-@ use strategy to hold Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant block &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought fier@@ c@@ ely because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ acy group said recently that some member states are mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Britain &apos;s itself created agenda with split agreements and distur@@ bing ones that they mostly don &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not affect the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance will climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants an outside of Britain within the EU &apos;s tent , says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not allow us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let us look through that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and civil servants come to the point where we don &apos;t care , whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s war@@ y ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , how it happened at the exagger@@ ated ten@@ ants such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or its en@@ forcement in 2017 .
he is also an abandoned force .
Poland quickly has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain an left one .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they should break up a lim@@ b to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better placed in the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers obviously plan to deliber@@ ately do helpful comments , throughout the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 , to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UK hasn &apos;t won any value from the rec@@ orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how hec@@ tic the Fle@@ et Street can be at its costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n inspired reference ums in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can also remember Boris Johnson who made the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his re@@ treats , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ for@@ bear@@ ded scarf , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and p@@ seudo @-@ id@@ ali@@ ens that most of our major newspapers .
Tony Bl@@ air actually thought of them but noted that when one sits on a cage in a cage , better ban@@ anas are spread to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ rian as Bl@@ air himself , because he had turned his speech on the Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which had thus opened a back@@ door .
the press never drag@@ ged him off .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly s@@ lap on the back in Westminster . I told him that he could no longer need to do any time for me to repeat Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott of boy@@ cott of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today .
it can take , but he has to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , but surely with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe - I &apos;m very friendly - in the development process .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wil@@ de@@ ous movie by Tor@@ ah Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism everyone can say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television that week said that when the sc@@ out had fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of pro@@ voc@@ ative John McDon@@ nell made a bad idea .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father turned himself to be loyal to his Labour @-@ cabinet with him , without going too far and lose his cabinet order .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
but to fight in &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ie &apos;s expression - wasn &apos;t that what McDon@@ nell said , yet what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening at Monday evening .
whatever the &apos; bottom @-@ up @-@ image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to op@@ tain , remember that he even has touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding home of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep track support in the speech campaign for a self @-@ evident act as McDon@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n with fundamental arrangements for EU membership - in line with its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion below the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its multi @-@ big@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Watson , Fel@@ sen@@ is convinced that J@@ C will not take any campaign to exit the outlet - will try foreign diplom@@ ats to try , in all , to find a sense of her su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they have also mis@@ leading voters - to make conc@@ essions to the Br@@ its , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US are already quite disappointed with weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory authorities in power , what I was re@@ minded on Monday at the start on Monday of something which the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed fund that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the evidence that they used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive investigation of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have question@@ ed the data lo@@ ad@@ ability and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical trade journal Lanc@@ et last month touched the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers have been writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health , at the London School of Hygiene , and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects the claim that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement is made from a single session of 12 people who have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to bring their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously given by British American Tob@@ acco funding ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants attended the meeting stated to receive resources by e @-@ cigarettes , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not supplied , but this includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also includes an industrial financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco administration of P@@ he took part too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research group of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ aring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the alle@@ g@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long rob@@ ber@@ y dies on his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to it , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has a unique duty to public@@ ise the public , what evidence shows , and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die every year at a sickness with regard to smoking , and smoking will cost two billion pounds per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should quit the East@@ er@@ end , says former head of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former chair@@ person of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC will stop to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their right arm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they will be public broad@@ ly viewed by a smaller audience , most likely to place in a hard @-@ contest@@ ed time window with the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals , and transm@@ it@@ ters as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC managing director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson that he had been trying to get in touch with channel 4 for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or sent it clearly by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson told the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I do in the medium or long term is not intended for a good idea , you should have at least on programs that do not make or job .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , as they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , of course it is non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is being financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erh@@ ders is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ made .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is to be public broad@@ ly .
I do not think this would l@@ essen the BBC in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to follow the hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular Shows will show the back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC wanted to sell as a East@@ er@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ IC programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they can argue they have their duties , and they can argue if they have done all those ob@@ s@@ oms for just@@ ification , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ struc@@ tions that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a window sky@@ light in which no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson declined to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding terms of conditions that can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all remember that we get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is correct , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said just little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of changing and talk to public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is dealt with , and with the commercial air alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ograms &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how Nem@@ o will alter the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with impul@@ sive impul@@ ses .
scientists have grown saus@@ ages with genetically modified Nerv@@ ous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ nov@@ at@@ ologists change the direction in the moment they have to be bl@@ ended with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing to be heard , in order to be ir@@ radi@@ ated .
impul@@ ses work by switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to respond to the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms cover the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ as , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that this process could replace the depths of a day , a invasive method that gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
fats are generally not respon@@ sive to ultrasound , but Chal@@ de@@ ani stated they were doing it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the worms .
the increased ultr@@ asonic waves can be used on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 icon can@@ als and found in membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ sen@@ ing cells .
the sound waves regul@@ ates that ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as Nature Communications report .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ o@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani was genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions play TR@@ P @-@ 4 icon can@@ als .
when ultrasound turns to the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied and transferred to the worms , where they switch off the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ - , a ground breaking tool , which allows researchers to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ ograms could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound scan felt un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that , with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to render temporary tolerance for the ultrasound signal in a clinical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin produced cells , added .

V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence , which was around advertising for the weapons of arms - and thought , &quot; We will give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic d@@ wi@@ el@@ ous company , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with bright colours and an animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student dormit@@ ory , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral relations , but only now I remember the stra@@ ined smile of those who have anno@@ yed - and to the many , slow complaints about others .
most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
moving in halls of student lives from easily ner@@ ven@@ ous up@@ lifting up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell you where you come from where and where you &apos;ve said that where you &apos;ve said to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you have to say &quot; honestly , Mar@@ m@@ ite is neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ eder ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out who you like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to those you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes were hit in fire@@ brand and these fires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
the rooms of people often transform themselves into beverages , film night event locations and municipal matches , but they are also the places where people wear and their under@@ wear .
reference : do not remember to start the university with a relationship .
intro@@ vert gave a rough handling of the university .
her room should be a refuge , but a lot of student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially capable and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture will allow you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away so I get the energy back with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ bat@@ one is de@@ pl@@ eted by soci@@ alising - and send SMS instead of t@@ apping him .
talking of ap@@ rop@@ os : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship shut through che@@ eks .
as you begin the university on the high point of Back Man@@ ie , this is the knock at the doors of men to imagine with a plate of brow@@ nies , much more strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s . welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to use . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will perhaps associate your face with a good surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mis@@ placed cl@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock .
steal food is a fug@@ itive crime in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it take a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are well that they say to themselves use yourself , even when they cook inside .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with that balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , the people from sleep or work lasts .
it &apos;s not just about being an decent man , but that you belong in the sense of prover@@ bs to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor question@@ ed her neighbors , whether there is something going on them to play some drum &amp; bass when there was three in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they acted promp@@ ted music with much more music .
when she finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she closed her own music , shut up her door and went to her three hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your sp@@ ouse is going to enter into the same student residence at random ?
in the other way , it would be un@@ ob@@ struc@@ turally embar@@ r@@ assing , when you keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse who would like to turn again and then see them every day , how they over@@ hau@@ led all of their friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own path , but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse is , try at least to talk to your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its keys in his not locked room is the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying f@@ one as it seems .
a good track is fun , but it only takes moments until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang to bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give us a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss any someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but stap@@ le their homes on the ceiling again more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , sole educ@@ ating , tann@@ ins
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds for people who do not have much money in the mid @-@ Frank@@ ish can@@ yon shel@@ ters for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a dream , but also the mother &apos;s alone and the Ger@@ ing@@ ser@@ je@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old is in an interview how I can do it still cheap and well @-@ built , &quot; says the 44 year old .
thousands of refugees come to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner thinks about how rapidly affordable housing can be created : he builds for refugees in a project of ter@@ raced houses .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees cr@@ ushing into the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : there is no sustainability in containers or train@@ ers .
because the people stay in a great part here .
in the face of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey inc@@ ite is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a field of rub@@ bers requires minimal space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different , if people are staying in living naked blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units for asylum seek@@ ers .
every apartment has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt easily according to each needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is € 184 000 , no property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
do the regulations have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have successfully passed my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the ending Dam@@ oc@@ cl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the plac@@ ements .
cre@@ epy .
it is still signed , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not spar@@ kle the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : we had made a boom in Germany over the last five years but have been luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother &apos;s own mother , or the indig@@ nation .
I am showing how you can build and build a good price today .
that &apos;s about it .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download , and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are pushed to problems after installation , as you get an error message telling the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght go back or trying to update through iTunes .
the phone itself will lead you through the rest of the process .
that may possibly mean the del@@ eting of apps to make space - but Apple has not likely to do that , if you are using a special tool to delete apps , and then install it again as soon as the process finishes .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charge device , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple not lets the update continue , as the phone may turn on hal@@ f@@ way , and may result in an abor@@ tion of updates .

it was a sympathy on First sight when the ri@@ ms met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently has completed her medical training at the hospital and wants to come into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller &apos;s good fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Rock St@@ ints and laughing .
&quot; when I was ready , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple was fond of the idea of using the own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families in the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he should see his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .

&quot; it shows , how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues , &quot; emphas@@ ised Sam@@ ier &apos;s natur@@ alist Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to the Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come into the field of ri@@ co@@ res in every quarter , in the North @-@ German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another house@@ work in A@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf , according to Ur@@ sel &apos;s cliffs .
if no successor could have found , it would be gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers will continue to be in confi@@ ded faces : taking over seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
their goodbye ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical profession only practiced for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ minded of Ur@@ sel Rock Pen@@ si@@ ausen .
even after the long time I feel a little of sad@@ ness .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often as often &quot; says the princess .
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I pressed myself down to gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; the border checks are now off at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Gui@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border continued to stay in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is clear , everyone who wants to give asylum application is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people and safety of people arise in the background .
however , it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia is continuing
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would like to have further displac@@ ed refugees towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is , however , strongly controls the limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister said , Slovenian does not want its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; every EU member must complete his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government secretly decided , the first refugees have already tried in the night following the Tuesday to escape in Ost@@ c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police got it up in the vicinity of maize fields .
according to local media , police cars with new refugees have ever been running in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrian and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
the rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country inv@@ ests more than 4000 fug@@ iti@@ ves , the Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would close to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously agreed to the Hungarian border so far , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the Belgrade government fought against it , however , that it is obvious that people refuse to strike certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , however , in the morning there was a first bus with 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were traveling all night away from the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police told us that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could actually lead to a somewhat distant destinations in the Balkan countries Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia - Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities to limit control &quot;
Croatian Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible ex@@ est@@ ial situations in the case of a strong stream of refugees .
details called he not , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive opportunities to limit control . &quot;
you guide rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a part of this since 2007 , while the EU partners have consistently selected a good report on the border of border controls .
according to the Hungarian border , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to the Belgian media reports , they would have spent the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ gos which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local focus in Hor@@ gos : keeping the debates on Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently negoti@@ ate a high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could not say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per cent to Mig@@ rants - dangerous Alternative Installation Rou@@ tes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute posters on refugees in which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , even 20 years after the end of the conflict there are still non @-@ cleared min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s life , therefore we went to the action in the middle of the city and among mankind , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ician &apos;s Head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice is also available to questions and discussions like the volunteers .
while man@@ ch is spont@@ ane@@ ously access@@ ing the cra@@ yon and take the phrase to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; we can continue &quot; to stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others briefly stand , read , say pro@@ positions as &quot; so far I &apos;m not &quot; and then go further .

hence this public effective action was good for 20 year olds .
that not everyone wants to be compl@@ ained on the tablets , is understand@@ able , finally it is a very personal thing .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ gig@@ ant expressed its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground level .
the company also said that she plans to hired more than 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday today .
at this point in time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company aims to set out 50.000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade fair 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in fiscal year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast .
analysts ask for a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prosp@@ ect is despite the price increases , which are on average 4.2 percent and on January 4th and despite higher supplements for ground transport of heavy and large packages which will be collected from November .
the company said that it nevertheless hoped that the result was increasing compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the business is weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to adjust 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra work@@ men , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned a total of 6 percent more than the previous year .
the earnings per share stood up to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted 12 of Z@@ acks investment research analysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the racks , analysts asked for an expected amount of 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex showed a decline in international priority shipping which had stag@@ n@@ ated sales in its unit Express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online shopping has improved the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices as the result fell because of a higher cost of labour in the freight shipment .
in the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on her most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist sitting two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time for the first time to lift the head start for almost a decade .
h@@ ending over them at a end of the decorated , two @-@ story seating area is a mur@@ al in the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double assignment of Congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a clear third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be dra@@ fted by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the near @-@ zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is soli@@ dly growing , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets make the most careful F@@ ed representatives to increase these vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for federal securities , and be it only one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in first place will be foremost what they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economics at Sty@@ rian company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the rate of interest did not increase , increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus regarding what the F@@ ed is doing is uns@@ ure on the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists that were asked recently from Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a rate of interest this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to raise an increase .
this indicates a down@@ fall of the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists are uns@@ aved in the blow by promising that another increase is far from .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones aver@@ ages an average score of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1,4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sti@@ pul@@ ated the movement this week said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they were not in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would deal un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow dis@@ appearance of mon@@ et@@ ric conditions that would test the strength of rest in the US .
Y@@ ell@@ as had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the freedom of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress would expect an increase in the proposition .
while the job creation in August was slow down , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % over the past month , the lowest since more than seven years , and close to the levels offered by F@@ ed as full employment .
contract gains have shown evidence of a recovery .
and although inflation went steadily under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , head meeting at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ das . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world watched the end of last month , after China had val@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial decline set fell by over 16 % in May by more than 16 percent , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down from the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market recovered slightly during this month , the Dow Jones is now nearly 10 % below the fall of May .
for F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence complex calculation , when interest increases interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news had not occurred on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US not@@ ebooks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is not the main requirement of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s F@@ ed monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed can close its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; dis@@ sol@@ dered confusion around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , they can not only monitor the developments in other locations but also meet with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , leader of global strategy for asset management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of reaction on finance market movements that apparently do not appear with the economic Fund@@ ament@@ als . &quot;
in the years 1998 / 1999 , L@@ acker announced as an exemp@@ li@@ fied member of the Federal Open Market Committee set for interest rate , z@@ iti@@ oned decisions in 1998 / 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their tails of 0.@@ 75 percentage points into three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite lim@@ iting noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later F@@ ed @-@ representatives introduced these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the 2008 mark shift in 2008 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Adam P. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where they &apos;re afraid of a interest rate because the markets inspire , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be pre@@ destined for the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
having a warm welcome , not without the engagement of countless volunteers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them were Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and a teacher .
she still teaches them with her 74 L@@ ess .
on every Thursday she is doing asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole thing is other than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
in a sho@@ cking way , the Brazilian organisation SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important good food is during the breast@@ feeding . this is done with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted on breasts which are painted in le@@ ases of un@@ whol@@ es@@ ome food .
breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies to use all the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ or@@ ic intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation should be given to mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of her babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ sdorf approved the building entry for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar plant .
the planning for the long @-@ received turn@@ around at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds come step by step : in the most recent municipal council session , the worked construction without large discussions was blessed .
prior to that , the Panel had also decided on an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ le &quot; exemp@@ tion from the current development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it went for permission to create a special form regarding the roof structure .
accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ quality first and roof top should be raised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when &quot; liberation &quot; again , it was rec@@ ti@@ ghtened around the roof pr@@ ism which is for energy reasons - different from the development plan , which is to be below ten degrees .
this will be significantly reduced in the volume of the hall .
&quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not permit a &quot; exceptions . &quot; in general , the Bern@@ ese municipal council is rather restri@@ c@@ tive by the actions of liberation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project at the gym : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turn@@ buck@@ le at the sports centre is a community centre for the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are calcul@@ able around 2.3 million euros .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and lat@@ itude transport .
the building entry for the 18 x 36 metres high hall will now be presented to the Land@@ rat@@ chet project for 18 x 36 metres .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg pul@@ ls to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ sl@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
we are looking at the surprised plans at the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kreis der , the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , however , will be making a decision on Wednesday , 23rd September .
if the plans were implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing inside station in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who can &apos;t work with Ch@@ ong@@ au should be offered at a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
staff are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the resign@@ ation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of his beginning , and is now in a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question , who will succeed him , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fishermen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who declared yourself ready to take over leadership and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au men@@ tions this in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and an en@@ rich@@ ment of the offer within the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
as an alternative for the next two years Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board is to agree , both houses lead until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which has still more than 35 beds , will be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ sl@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county was planned in the year 2018 for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation of the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital is completed .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , who is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors , came towards what the house , which is in possession of the Federal Republic , shall be used as an asylum for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better it could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively and understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a true perspective for the house , where Fischer has worked as a head physician for more than 30 years , did not give it .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take the position of medical director .

after a donation a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were carried out in hospitals .

a susp@@ ect has led the police for the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old victims of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was admitted to have killed the juven@@ iles and have thrown her body into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes .
on Tuesday evening , the corp@@ se of the young woman was found at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern on Tuesday evening , as the Public Prosecutor and Police in Wednesday afternoon .
as a supp@@ susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old worker was taken up as a supp@@ or@@ ption that promp@@ ted the indication and given the investig@@ ator to the site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after the evening after a visit to a autumn track in rock enh@@ ausen was not as agreed to the house .
investig@@ ating a young wife investig@@ ates first on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in case of question@@ ing in the circle of friends and the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ance , a crime suspicion arises up against the 20 year old .
the alleged off@@ ender then led the police to a channel in rock enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
the arrest , according to the police , was reported to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and laid the corp@@ se into the Canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the harbour ; investig@@ ators put a burden on him .

refugees need accommodations : study warns against homes
the location on the German property market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek for a paid stay .
the printing on the residential property is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German domestic market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and unemployed from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many capit@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing units .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result comes from a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are ready in Germany .
14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged as a asylum seek@@ ers after the first three months of their stay .
many to@@ ast them on the residential property and rows into the long lines ahead of the rental apartments .
however , according to the Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers survived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable investments in the residential construction industry of the past years .
Germany p@@ ushes a residential @-@ deficit to be increased from year to year .
currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas some 7@@ 0,000 units are missing , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals stayed in large cities in WG rooms .
young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama because of the fle@@ ece on the property market . &quot;
in the cities the number of square metres per capita has declined in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost the social housing .
to this rate , the tax rate could be wai@@ ved and the base tax will be exposed for supported apartments .
in addition , the coalition provides attractive fiscal and de@@ preci@@ ation options .
for cities and communities the promotion program for refugees is already well @-@ established in cities and mun@@ icipalities .
a good week after the launch was launched at the Monday evening of 184 million euro , more than half of the funding came from around 300 million euros .
now it could be extended even now .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia make corridor a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no more is gone , there more refugees always pick up the way for Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that there is a crossing of Slovenia after the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia about establishing a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Slov@@ ene indoor minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already on the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian border , hundreds refugees fled to Croatia to reach Europe from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the borders at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , including the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had set off its border with refugees on day before .
new laws , which entered into force the same day , are practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men want to live and want to achieve something .
but there are people who wouldn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police launched the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s Serbian Border to the borders of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
during the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees stum@@ bled not on the f@@ ences .
it ent@@ ails other dangers : there are still clear@@ es mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , hardly any refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the Police attracted 3@@ 66 entran@@ ced people .
shortly before the closing time on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws adopted the di@@ zz@@ iness and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as an off@@ ense .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the south Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted dro@@ pl@@ s thre@@ aten up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ si@@ oning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locked on Tuesday in the newly assigned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ si@@ oning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locked in a total of 94 asylum applications , almost all of them - 93 - took the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ant are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees were still there .
practically , there is no longer a view to get asylum in Hungary .
following a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; tran@@ si@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke a few hundred refugees were assembled .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to rise up .
they collected the garbage who left tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
lat@@ tices were min@@ ed and one of the shooting camp in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express the aim of this conversion .
Austria will reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still staying in the country .
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing and regularly , smaller groups of refugees meet on foot .
mayor crossed &quot; crossed &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy upon the bridge on Sunday , when ten people stood there with Reis@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had been un@@ expect@@ edly closed by rail traffic on Sunday , however , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , the city that immediately offered its help and the stran@@ gled together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
before we gave the unexpected guests only once , with shower and drink .
we felt right away , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler for the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take , a generous donation of money - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very pleased to us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the subsi@@ ded train stations were switched on Sunday evening at Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , and , following the short notice , it was announced that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still over the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the circuit .
the bridge firm joined the Bavarian neighbours to Sunday , a day before a br@@ isk walk - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria of Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án therefore sends more of thousands to us , a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy is : &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately upon the establishment of structures in order to guarantee Human@@ ity , our Chancellor was officially opened to the position of the Hungarian Government in the sphere of National Soci@@ alism .
these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ant@@ oth@@ es will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited to welcome , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a big challenge in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter , to help us decent states for protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ ded Quar@@ terly
Konrad has full of operations with the refugee performance to do all hands .
Christian Konrad is also used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to set up lo@@ dg@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen have already gained control in the gras@@ p of Konrad .
&quot; we do not have the homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without a great vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5,000 pieces of Quart@@ et will be predicted at the He@@ ur@@ k Year .
to meet the number , there must still be 35@@ ,000 lo@@ dg@@ ings in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 euro wai@@ st@@ band .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; Konrad .
he has had talks with the state tri@@ but@@ aries .
these could have secured him , even for the coming refugees to come in lo@@ dg@@ ings .
&quot; it runs fine in Upper Austria , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ El@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations of the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also puts into the ORF action as well as we . &quot;
the platform can offer private individuals and private accommodation .
moreover , one hopes there will be vac@@ ant in the open during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally Conrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in lap@@ times , it could not be that lo@@ dg@@ ings must be certain height of the towel holder or in the height of the upper yard .
for a temporary period of time &quot; emergency standards would have to be considered .
as opposed to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful at home , based on Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t put in my face without any doubt .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Conrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the cost as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
even so far it has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
however , there are obviously trouble with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
there is no opening of municipal sports halls , and other buildings such as the tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
Isabel Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) is currently not necessary to deal with these measures without any such measures .
other locations should be checked for emergen@@ cies , however , in case of emergency .
criticism of the local chef on the organization of refugees inside the Federal state .
other areas have to make their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian prime @-@ minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , the comm@@ anding officer Josef P@@ ühr@@ ing , VP ) celebrated the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday .
See@@ hofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continued travelling of refugees in the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
but there are now the respective border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will be no longer available .
however , the protection of protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a one of the other EU member states called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ hr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Austria has res@@ o@@ unded inspec@@ tions on his limits , a logical consequence is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the fore@@ going of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general shi@@ pyard of the &quot; New shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings , the publicly traded IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) , is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies at the New Shi@@ pyard and , later , also to @-@ rate those .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the very beginning S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - while defe@@ ats got some promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is managed from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 per cent of the total of 2700 square metres of resi@@ due in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are any requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Ark@@ ade
the new shop is located in the centre of the Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags .
anyway , Jutta grew up a dog .
this project had to move the 49 year old In@@ hab@@ erin of Li@@ a Per@@ oni to open @-@ up in the Tau@@ ber market @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally , it has now grown into the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop over the business , where they sold them bags , bags , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , now all revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
a series of weeks has been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a long time I wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crucial factor for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , were done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater region of Linz , who sell this trade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have made Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interests has got wide from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I share the most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why did some woman look at the look of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , the specialist can &apos;t answer with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher of K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a town whose population is called the An@@ ders .
this feature lies with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always fine for off@@ setting .
whether he makes himself alien@@ ated from foreign journalists , journalists touching or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presi@@ dential Memorial ir@@ rig@@ ged the campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pentec@@ ost@@ al K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million originate .
the New Yorker at F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to about -@@ dirty corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in trial mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del sp@@ un a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in its cult style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spr@@ ats , to which besides Tr@@ ump is the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the king of the heart , he has not brought it there .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dently the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ y@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the len@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is thus from the village of the geber .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the USA opened a local for gold dig@@ gers .
foundations of the property portfolio were the first site of land in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland , failed the Bavarian state that belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate back then .
he did not capture Tr@@ ump because he had once cut off his approval , the director of the Institute for Pentec@@ ost@@ al History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explained .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ one statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and required the building of a boundary wall to fri@@ gh@@ ten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just as pol@@ em@@ ic , that &apos;s not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote kin@@ ship ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was bor@@ rowed Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement is an Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always so ru@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens once ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund dar@@ ker mentioned by Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , as many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family came to a visit to the church organ , which ended overall well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the game of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is better if he didn &apos;t feel the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not have such radical view@@ points , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the failure at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s more interesting reading than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ z@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as the president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
and &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , for the Tr@@ ump @-@ long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ist , even in the USA .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the efforts of Nine , to assume loss of leadership in the Today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son has to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has no big shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show by Nine was aired by the German capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull advanced the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV broad@@ casts , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un belonged .
this dis@@ advantage of resistance seemed to be played by Australian TV spectators there , as Sun@@ rise obtained an average of 39@@ 7,000 votes in the five major cities , in comparison to Today 33@@ 9@@ .000 .
today , Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number was lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August , Today , Today was 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise came to an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret dis@@ closes ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously seem un@@ unk@@ now@@ ingly who wins The bach@@ elor .
the woman , when Sam Wood was finally put in a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree , was env@@ elop@@ ed in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left girl will certainly not return if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked together with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before returning from three , you possibly have given a hint of who will be the vic@@ torious .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way that Wood is the perfect man and named it its sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to play cor@@ rup@@ ters , who won the heart of the Bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except herself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I saw in the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that they were quite compatible with , and I thought that it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the House was clear to her that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now waiting for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked , W@@ hom do you choose , if not she , it was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left girl equal - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be scre@@ ened on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams trying to send inquiries to his impressive day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ on chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers had banned the rest of the game for the rest of the game when he lost a rum@@ ble as it did in his first Pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula was familiar with his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to an Pun@@ t return , and also in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the cabin box after the game .
instead of gr@@ illing its ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the team through the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference at the end of the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ welt Cam In@@ man noted that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Spec@@ acher &apos;s Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to take care of his lost catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , a pun@@ t restored on an pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Code
it was certainly not the start to believe Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suicide for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the pitch after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t introduce a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which is now going on , you just care for the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass was at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed , after police officers get shot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the south of Nepal , after the police had fired in a crowd forming around the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , and some of them cast stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and moved into the air before taking back to rubber .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t clear why the rubber she@@ ers used , of which it is known to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the dispute was the last weeks of violent protest at Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces will be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal on the Th@@ arus ethnic group , which means an independent state .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step toward a new constitution , but a controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled incredibly central for centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process of devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ature must be voted by certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , including investors and administration officials , Ralf Behr@@ inger went on to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building Executive Board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
this project has been developing some ten to twelve million euros in the process for months .
heavy reactions led by sea food owners who had come into the meeting , called out the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the owner and member of the member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like some other projects , he fears that traffic would greatly rise through the proposed size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus@@ lad@@ les must come to ensure that &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what is exactly on the well known acres of the former restaurant is happening , is , however , still open .
still there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a fluid concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and because it was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL @-@ O ) announced a double @-@ made donations campaign , which should help thousands of refugees to have rolled out the thousands of refugees who have over@@ ruled the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with their family from Kabul , she was seven years old for her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our journey many dark railway and bus rides , also hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing help for refugees and migrants . doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations up to € 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / sh@@ iel@@ ding was doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , mainly by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily out@@ dated di@@ abe@@ tics .
loss of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new Study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
more than the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations have proven effective in type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were carried out by people who are ob@@ ese @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicate that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates that have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obesity - gast@@ ric ul@@ tery and gast@@ ric tu@@ b@@ ular approach - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI amongst those under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI remained among those who received non @-@ surgical treatment treatments about the same time as 29 .
among those exposed to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was dissolved completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely dis@@ b@@ anded by only one percent , and partly at only approximately two percent .
moreover , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patients blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is among the best among 7 percent , write the researchers .
according to the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , in comparison with the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and in more cases a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery under five years , there are evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was affected by ob@@ ese people who tried to die in obesity , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that made conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BMI of under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with their BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we too long wait until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes they have felt their bodies along with obesity and diabetes , a recur@@ rent is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is often aug@@ ment@@ ing in fiction : a young woman , too vag@@ u@@ ely un@@ loved and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets years after years the shame of her youth , and he falls in love with her .
also in the recently written novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe could not record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader also urged to stop violence in the indigenous people of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten days visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the grand opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion , Oxford which devoted eth@@ ics studies .
he ordered that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of each nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries was ad@@ mired on the refugee crisis but the situation isn &apos;t adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and real development , primarily through education or by these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must re@@ think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action following the terror attack of 11 September and issued that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he resist@@ ed violence , and that caused some un@@ expect@@ edly consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase from the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ic@@ control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , the strongly alcoholic beverages , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants increased in children under 12 years of age , the tox@@ ic@@ control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said some children to drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press her friends or having a mut@@ ing with the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have report@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol water , to obtain a har@@ dy beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ aded .
it is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange paint , which are very appe@@ aling to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the manager at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would have no sip of whis@@ ky lying around , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant taken in school was brought to a emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies in an adult legally to get drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor she treated at the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acks her words and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency .
doctors carefully monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had dropped his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended to use alcohol and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store suspension inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
on alco@@ hol@@ ism there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol contained a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an agent .
in January , three pupils addressed their fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; common &quot; teacher , by putting anti bacterial products around the classroom , so it mel@@ ts a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants . they appointed them from their room .
the police examined the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; and had discipl@@ ined measures to the training authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross bar in the direction of the industrial area and was too late to see that at the roundabout , two predicted vehicles had stopped .
as a result , he sw@@ elled with his lor@@ ry back to the stern of an audience and pushed this vehicle to a front of Ford Fie@@ sta .
the police came to an accident of about 10 000 euros , divi@@ ding the police .

Griff@@ i@@ ths play Sav@@ ede about the dis @-@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spont@@ ane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare to the confron@@ tation with the Dutch tab .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football with Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic ships because there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ kings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
it speaks about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m play , and there aren &apos;t only men in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
Ron@@ ny D@@ eila has accepted that Celtic needs to fight , but the nor@@ we@@ gian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and subsequent ex@@ crete from the Champions League , the defeat of a 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now clearly stand with five points ahead at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already made bad times , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry and sad about what happens .
we feel this way - but we must go on .
we really need the Celtic assistance , because it makes the player better .
now it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while they are rising in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people excluding work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scottish &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was higher than the U@@ VA of 5.5 per cent , as the figures for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 per cent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I become a member in Oklahoma , USA ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I am going to see how a man is put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the capital chamber in Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard S@@ sip is ex@@ h@@ orted by the tox@@ cast .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day moved closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story over the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications as places available , find a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery instead of deci@@ ding who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will be emotion@@ ally watching .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to sit alongside Richard Mal@@ si@@ ps directly , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visiting .
I like the guy .
often we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say I am not a witness , and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma acc@@ uses me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ee as he wants and you get access .
I appreciate it with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Mal@@ sip had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he didn &apos;t tell me what to write about , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter there to write there .
when he dies , he thinks his relations work will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a replica of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the review of Podcasts I &apos;ve made .
I will not go down again for all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty , that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of an act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , where you can apply .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man &apos;s unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards tried to blow it out and threat@@ ening to finish the racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy said that Ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he targeted on Ste@@ wards and the Integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best suited for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ t@@ up@@ take sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he can &apos;t explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age pre@@ judi@@ ces , and would not want it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to see how too high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long to eat that , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that all at once comes , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know that far .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up the main head and I want my owners think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach .
then I must think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had put the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integration department had tried to sp@@ ade its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months , Mr. Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sat in a room with a man - which I will name when I &apos;m asking - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
you seem to believe that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if that is the case , they surely should write about their n@@ oses , because they are trying to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , current President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of that at the time and are still today .
should I bring this to the mind that it will be personally ?
does the RU@@ L have to worry and do people outside of Train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there that I am .
perhaps they will have to take my license and get lost , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes back against competition on ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the Ar@@ rival of the Storm &quot; Ring &quot; competition started with his team during the high Storm wins in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett did hardly conce@@ aled note on the Storm team after his crew reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample creation &quot; at Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land was not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the team &apos;s speed and said that she was only focused on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team got him confi@@ dential , as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ers when she took us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing throughout the year at our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that has provided us the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as this time it is up again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy relies on the idea of &quot; thrilling football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ettes St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons had won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; more boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit .
but now he has a team that can play , and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build their trust , because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried about being able to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster had higher earnings as the game Bron@@ co at cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points turned over ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
when we mention it , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase .
the Storm team have free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the pre @-@ finals at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning .
Serbia &apos;s 200.000 $ deposit to drug attachment
a man who is possibly a lifetime penalty is threatened due to his failure in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , a deposit of 200,000 $ was released .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the police forces took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly lifetime penalty for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic claimed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire crowd and that it could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the risk of flood at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated the court on Wednesday .
during the pris@@ al , he lied on the c@@ ops of his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200.000 dollars as a security bond to meet his release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the read explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judges Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set free of deposit , under the conditions that he logged into the Australian and his Serbian for@@ ts to sign up daily for a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 with Karlsruhe : driving position is ri@@ pped apart
on a dri@@ ve@@ drive with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday night a truck driver has been seriously injured .
two of the three participating trucks had bra@@ ked their bra@@ cing in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and trying to sof@@ ten the last moment to the left , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
the driver &apos;s guide of the accident @-@ created tear is completely apart .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to attract educ@@ ation@@ ists to send images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the girl &apos;s phone while this was sleeping , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children that were sent by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it by , found the conf@@ using messages , and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police took care of therefore , and saw the five pictures analyzed by the computer which were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches &quot; used to search for inde@@ cent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials , that he would do it because there would lead to &quot; educ@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; gave &quot; a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer in Ei@@ li@@ ie Roberts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ iff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that it would be ad@@ diction that he is ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching for the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten pa@@ ge@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked about his talks with the uni@@ denti@@ fied person who sent him the pictures and he asked them to send more pictures .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he would like to see images of rape and murder .
MS Roberts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and on weeping .
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the telephone , con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty in terms of the indictment , un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and pleaded not guilty to the charges on 24 March of that year .
the Secretary @-@ Adv@@ oc@@ ate Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the sexual off@@ ender as you can argue that &quot; there is no real sexual element in his going .
Sher@@ iff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael whether the judgement lasted until October to get background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case and was held liable for hear@@ ings on other notable cases in pre@@ ventive cases .
he was added before the release of the judgment in the Register of the Sexual off@@ ender .
locks on small border cros@@ sings to Germany from
more and more refugees are accessed aside from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ houses were made of fear and discovery the people multiplied to smaller border passes .
out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken on Tuesday in the districts of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn .
they were walking over bridges and engra@@ ver on the German side .
there they are checked with police police in reception and for@@ warded to the registration .
according to Federal police stations , the Munich Central Station came again clearly more refugees in comparison with the weekly paper on Wednesday .
more than 700 people arrived in the country &apos;s capital alone until 8.00 , said a spokes@@ man on the morning .
after re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : the suspension of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; awaits in the southwest
Meteor@@ ologists war@@ n before the storm in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe , warm marine air flows currently distributed to the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the vig@@ orous right was the for@@ erun@@ ner of the &quot; Henry &quot; spread over the Atlantic Island over the past few days .
heavy storms and storm are expected above all in Baden .
according to D@@ WD it is also Thursday to Thursday morning , in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District circle with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
this Friday , the sun is easy to ga@@ ze at once again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturer show their novel@@ ties at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
2015 is particularly popular among the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 2@@ 8,1 % of the new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic design vehicles and luxury cars .
one of the biggest mer@@ its for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be show@@ c@@ ased at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should also not be much more expensive .
Opel is entering a starting point under the biggest competition VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 hp engine .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competition VW Golf and Ford Focus , there are Opel Astra at first only as five thousand .
as a second variant , the com@@ bi @-@ com@@ bi version will follow soon , even at the Frankfurt Show .
and what is next to the Astra at the IAA for new comp@@ ac@@ comp@@ ile ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra &apos;s compet@@ itor in the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade , it joins the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Boom , with the new model , wants to find its position in the highly @-@ growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti also adap@@ ts to its curved lines into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which makes its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is measured at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the opening of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but the compact f@@ las@@ hing model DS 4 is completely renovated , that is at the IAA .
the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n stor@@ fer put on the front part in front of the front panel : here the radiator gr@@ ille has been re@@ drawn , and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the Interior was modernis@@ ed the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , which reduces the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there will be a series of designs and new variants like the newly re@@ bran@@ ded Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell is deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court used an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel Police of Justice , which was housed for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of her human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
most people may hope that they may hope for money , if they were locked up only a few days in the areas to close ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional autonomy in Karlsruhe was successful : it was housed in a single cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
afterwards , the man , who was now on the right foot after his approach , was moved to a bigger cell .
his inauguration happened because of the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the land of Berlin .
however , the Constitu@@ tional Jud@@ ge lowered the chamber of the chamber of Berlin and referred back the case to the renewed day .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Chamber of Appe@@ als will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if cancelled due to legal reasons , however , only a few days of prison for the compensation are required , whether a compensation scheme is given .
otherwise , &quot; an out@@ law of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of the accounting .
the Constitu@@ tional Jud@@ ges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
they only said in April to a prisoner , because he was in prison in a prisoner .
un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the multiple @-@ occupancy of one cell without any separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , also , subsequently confirmed a decent accommodation , led by a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ case in November 2009 .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was in the Kar@@ g@@ her case for about three months between 15 to 21 hours a day .
the Berlin pris@@ ons came into the head@@ lines during the last weeks due to lack of staff .
cap@@ tives were therefore always confin@@ ed at a time 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness to fight , even to fight cause it should have been too stra@@ ined due to the stra@@ ined location .
according to the Justice Pres@@ enter , 21 positions in Te@@ gel for young lack are not occupied , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we can do this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany by Vice President &apos;s Office of Germany , following statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany , even in its position to take a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Health ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Life ) are used annually , for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically is the lack of living space but particularly in paid rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 of private apartments are out of the rental fee , and around these particularly favorable rentals will apply for refugees too .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) plans therefore to double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 workers annually have to arise and therefore the federal government should invest a degree in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers and Federal Minister of State agree that there must be more control benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically used after their qualification , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , this is crucial whether they are working in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , it has made a political turn : from work pro@@ hibition for refugees to recognition work .
while earlier passed a work pro@@ hibition for asylum seek@@ ers up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dency of asylum seek@@ ers to asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , too , due to the professional sc@@ andal , the visibility has been en@@ forced to allow refugees to be made possible with access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
so far there is no sufficient supply of common and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs can be facil@@ itated most often by personal contact .
the structure of networks is therefore to be sent to view from the people &apos;s view to the Königs@@ weg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School Administration has established that only a few vulnerable parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for parents , it is only important to stick to the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ stan@@ ze , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the hand@@ book is distributed in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by train more universities .
in the countries , pupils without knowledge of knowledge are prepared in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by teachers trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ em from the Berlin School Administration .
the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
but in principle no asylum seek@@ ers or abi@@ ding the study - the only exception was Berlin , whose sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given its position now .
degree of courses of refugees may be facil@@ itated by access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce no longer receive certificates following an asylum @-@ seek@@ er policy if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive BA@@ fö@@ G as they fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ legitim@@ ate persons .
estimated refugees have had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to legitim@@ ize BA@@ fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ ans were shortened to 15 months .
however , this funding must be concluded , demanding Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student .
the students should immediately get BA@@ fö@@ G .
Islam will soon be a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is more important to their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually revi@@ ve Islam under the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state of the state shall continue to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation of an islam@@ ic welfare association would also be important to care about the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas , and to provide certain control options .
this also includes will@@ ingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concerns , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany as well .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be much more integration in the future than today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the majority society must change , the mining of discrimination and rac@@ ism is troubled .
indeed - Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination area and a general framework law .
however , it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU @-@ series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive of a systematically mis@@ sive motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and interest groups have long been calling for a long term and why international agreements would become reality for what is going to remain peaceful in the next few years , if the country will remain peac@@ efully and their new citizens must use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking Germany , Germany was able to medi@@ cally care for the expected refugees , referring to medical president Frank Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we accomplish this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money has to flow to the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery needs to submit all of the en@@ quiries with the registration of health .
the achievements could be expected , later , with federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people send to the limited performance catalogue containing the asylum application of asylum .
otherwise we will make the doctors particularly the language barriers .
previously , the Berlin @-@ based Scientific Sci@@ entist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are bl@@ ur@@ red more badly about her disease than other patients .
these services should not only be paid in hospitals , clinics even in hospitals .
this would be helped many refugees , even with more common medical records on emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among children of children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities ; and with the young people I go about HIV / AIDS .
but with the partial different clinical pictures , German doctors really come from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; paras@@ ite diar@@ rho@@ ea or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and what comes to anger may even be even reli@@ eving the refugees in sight .
the Syrians would have developed a high @-@ developed educational system . some refugees are even doctors .
to be able to practice , however , they had to prove their qualification and possibly de@@ comp@@ ose again tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress relie@@ ve or in depression .
hobbies are especially vulnerable to refugee kids , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives in Germany .
those who suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress relie@@ ve is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pac@@ zz@@ iness , and death fri@@ ghtened .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms were chronic , an early treatment was necessary , as Mun@@ z declared .
yet until now , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers may apply for Psych@@ otherapy in the social relations , the processing takes usually several months .
in addition to social workers , specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would not decide whether a therapy is needed or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe thinks wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stair@@ case at the start of this year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the experience spread rapidly throughout the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by claims of ME@@ Ps from the Opposition that they had been warned for anonymous death threats and had warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last month they had blown up and interrupted him during his speech at the State of Parliament in parliament , and this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones which they warned against , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es Address .
&quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalist for Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns of the affected Parliament members that the par@@ ity ends in parliament and once they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party run by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard lives up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to set up 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP is split up into two listed companies and split the computer and printer shop from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected new job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead to the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise gets smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we have better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be concentrated on providing so far un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shares a company that has been set up in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to produce electric plants and their Palo Alto garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has used a massive re@@ structure to tackle the switching of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on belief that closely focused companies bring better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and if his rehabilitation after plan is going , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the major dis@@ grace at this present problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate an@@ kl@@ ing@@ injury and then back to his old momentum during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which was not well cured .
it is not a larger matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical view , as Wen@@ ger also recognized that there is the corresponding risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also a very pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als of arsen@@ als of 157 points in the last five seasons .
the bro@@ ader picture of the arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , who have experienced most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s field , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time to strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he has gone through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his champ@@ ions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ co Zagreb prior to play against Chelsea du Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta have to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it , a small bre@@ ather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al has clear favor@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake where the Richter scale was 3,2 measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions @-@ League @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains away from distant hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
but it hasn &apos;t worked out in an arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Day : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , who grants us serious lessons on men of men .
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now desper@@ ate than ever before , how sel@@ fish @-@ rates suggest , amongst young men , on a 15 @-@ year yo@@ ke .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there remains three times more common in males than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ iel ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 considered the year of the man to ask the culture in question that men hin@@ ders to seek aid when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media communication , with its focus on style , the imp@@ ec@@ tivity of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though the isolation is domin@@ ating the insulation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what is psych@@ ologists exc@@ tr@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our in@@ trin@@ sic longing for personal development and friendship that affect our spiritual health .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can &apos;t really buy happiness .
the beauty in Friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , that sh@@ one by interaction as friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler Common Hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in the soccer gu@@ okes , in some comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they are often with@@ holding down entirely their feelings .
as an employee of the telephone number of calls I told me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ble roll for people who are depres@@ s@@ ant and compl@@ ac@@ ious , has shown me clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am righ@@ t@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , if you are talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term assets .
she presents very clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status via telephone calls the people in moments of despair even help which long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re visiting the weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest , with the celebration of the day totally re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you pick your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you watch in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone sitting alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ feast
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Mal@@ mo
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malmö .
in his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria meets PS@@ G to move from Malmö .
here are the game @-@ report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Holy Cav@@ ani kept on course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince parks on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League of debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but after it finally climbed up a number of occasions before having finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani had scored a head@@ line in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Pl@@ av@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish Masters , since they are not only stri@@ ving for the K.@@ O.@@ N. rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ es in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no classic game of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ sky missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in play against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to provo@@ ke and rela@@ xes our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we have won , even though I am sorry we did not have one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic was returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ to in their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentine imp@@ etus was referred to as the man who was taken up at the next stage in Europe when he went on to the next stage in Manchester , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass , before leaving Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
however , if one believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Malmö , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic in a play @-@ off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went to reach this stage , compet@@ ed with nine national players on the field and was a major opponent in mid@@ section with a five @-@ man defense and two low in the middle class . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but except a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they f@@ ain@@ ted little .
instead , PS@@ G self gave himself up sometimes , with some mis@@ pas@@ sports and bad connections , not least recently from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was missing with no less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had placed him after the re@@ boot .
however , he was showing much more skill when he put his players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic forming the Di Maria into a shooting down , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er therefore scored his sixth flight door since Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had captured a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts of Malmö in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ ill Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end in the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; Our last Champions League play was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not reach out . &quot;
hat@@ s off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented a change from FC Bayern in 2008
world champion and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just prior to the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona so far .
eight times Spanish Master , three times winner champ@@ ions , four times champion Champions League , two time club champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al @-@ S@@ add sports Club to Qatar .
however , in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi advised that he was already standing in front of Barcelona before the end of March 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça will sell me . &quot;
&quot; back then &quot; Madrid won everything that we do nothing , &quot; he says .
and that registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a quot@@ ation of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ el@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
in memory : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the country of FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not changed
but the change did not come about .
and the resulting man for this work today for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola among contract and I played a great role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has got me with it . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Play@@ ground in 2008 / 2009 would be running with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi disp@@ uted for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Sea ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and finished the monarchy at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film creating
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ akers Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the variety and said they will not be required behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown empha@@ sized that the need of alternative perspectives indicated , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the main script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and cried &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian refused .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Shel@@ a Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ relative brothers to discuss the fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director , as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white guard .
the producer of Dear White People bet for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the st@@ aging rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded the dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni sque@@ e@@ zed his anger over the clip when he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in space , so he can tell their variety - this is SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et received more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since it launched its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a point where accurate ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the point of social discussion .
after a white polic@@ emen were killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , Michael Li@@ ves captured Black Li@@ ves in the country and urged the government to provo@@ ke a criminal influence on color bugs .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduc@@ tory albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums are matter matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black life , albums still have their importance .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of Fox News Person@@ ality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hatred @-@ group .
the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , I announced that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has received the invitation or already made the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
professional athl@@ ete and control help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athl@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 Million .
the competition , which finished just in the 7th season , had never experienced a competition , who was able to close all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season there were two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the finals .
during the last task , the climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended up the task within the time when he finished the first athl@@ ete , which ended the st@@ ress@@ ful phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero did this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under shock over the prize of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it is astonishing to think about this , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or to live &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
so very suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he didn &apos;t finished the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money at all .
after the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , there will be one of the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful value and life changes , he receives the glorious gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I do not think he swe@@ eps any anger over it .
he has just done so lucky to have done what he did .
a masses of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt like that , if they had switched the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to a eighth season , the filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . nowadays the tig@@ ers stand on last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday they played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb up into a play @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game @-@ card .
for Detroit , even if only for a night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to gras@@ p over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories do fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Bal@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit offered three times in the first two out@@ ings , then once in sixth and then in the ninth time .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside with three ranks in the 1 / 3 inside .
it was just his third successful start to his final nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw any game in the Bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I want to be completely concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two sections , his first R@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle &apos;s Muslim on July 6 .
&quot; he has worked very well on the drums , &quot; said Out@@ mus .
he looked good at ( brass training ) , looked very much better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear of the seventh inner ring the T@@ wins had its best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bass Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man confronted with which he was confronted with the design of the Roo@@ kie Tal@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , the Two @-@ Run Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen , a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Su@@ ou@@ ffe to a double @-@ play .
it was that in the major League , leading the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe is a double @-@ play .
after it came to the end of the ninth down inside a Insurance Run , wall represented a R@@ BI @-@ double against the loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed h@@ itch left S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth row .
in the beginning of the game Detroit prof@@ ited from a yet non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers scored three ran@@ kings in the first two out@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after spending more than a month because of a back @-@ in .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I called myself , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; but I felt comfortable when I broke and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ und@@ o received a single second from Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who managed to run a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the sc@@ oring in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Baz@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed on the second , scored one one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not work well , but he caught the right job .
Hughes was in a Pit@@ ch Count , and scored no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the rail@@ ing @-@ handed h@@ al A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer .
at Hughes , there were four R@@ uns with four stroke outs and four stroke outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was out of an injury to the throwing school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who worked for the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , from mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list , because of a shoulder @-@ break , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
using Sanchez out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is canc@@ eled by the vulner@@ ability list to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers , since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on 20 August because of a dist@@ ortion in the right wr@@ ist .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins are going to end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnes@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP T@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most involved people will be accommod@@ ated in emergen@@ cies in Wiesbaden , just like the City of Wiesbaden in Tuesday night .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 years of refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an State &apos;s capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be stopped there temporarily .
they should then continue to spread to other mun@@ icipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the government &apos;s initial manual , P@@ 500 people in Hessen arrived in Hessen alone .
even Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have been decorated for the large number of refugees in sporting events .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria extend an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures in Syria with German involvement in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this determined reflection on military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective gu@@ esses . &quot;
four years ago , we had been glad that the cup was passing from a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict lies in front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington urged the massive stock@@ pil@@ ing of international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced inspec@@ tions to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday night on the Austrian TV station ORF , and is now no longer sent to Hungary .
also Germany have sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria every day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it had already made talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures did not show them , and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria in the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria in recent days .
their goal is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special Summit on the next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet had a common ancest@@ or in the crisis so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers of the EU will take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) towards a special meeting on the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first appearance and distribution of people .
on the end of Tuesday , Merkel will join the League of managing directors after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who need for protection and protect them as well .
but those who do not have any question pro@@ spective , could not remain in Germany too .
this idea was strongly assigned in the lap .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor empha@@ sized that the state as a whole needs to gain a huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now stuck to the bal@@ kan@@ ers .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also extending the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country belongs to the EU as a member of the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g boats deployed across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government convicted the plan immediately .
first ar@@ rests were people who had cut fence the fence .
in Turkey , according to the Greek border , thousands of migrants are reported to report to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean in Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
the main spa of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sponge a global ocean .
these are researchers from observ@@ ations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; group .
thus , the moon is distur@@ bing lightly on its path around the Ring@@ bearer .
this di@@ mer@@ ging movement is only small , but still too large for a thoroughly fixed cel@@ est@@ ial body , it is called the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers put their analyses at the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
it was well known that there should be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es on the south side of the Satur@@ n@@ monds to feed the water vap@@ or and ice r@@ ots and thereby feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least in the South Pole it had to give a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clari@@ fied .
Rama is missing several weeks in Munich
the 1860 München would have to refra@@ in from a month on open acc@@ ine of Val@@ ues , Rama .
an investigation led an examination of an examination of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old and shared the association .
Rama has already compl@@ ained about pain early the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to cause four weeks of compulsory ex@@ ause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s hard for us , Rama is a bit loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must re@@ think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ ing Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a united pros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as training g@@ ast , the six@@ ties presented , however , a def@@ ensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale has been active in Belgium and was already under contract in the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is at present &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove its skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specialists Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week after his brain shift .
already on Thursday , the Austrian National Poker should boarding the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie joined the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a fierce battle at the head .
but despite the first fears , he remained without the overwhelming gl@@ es@@ orship .
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
who wants to care to his slender line , often rather sli@@ pping away from them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively large sugar - mainly suc@@ rose .
healthy is the exotic fruits yet : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mostly contain man@@ gos but plenty of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ otene .
if one eats the fruit , thus supports sight , immune and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Mang@@ os is not too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly cra@@ w@@ ling .
the shell @-@ colors alone tell nothing about how ripe fruit is - so green man@@ gos are delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
they then , of course , taste and eat in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , gives heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter taste of some leaf let@@ tu@@ als such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ grove is fine with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ado , then distinctive cold front
the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn falls sil@@ es like met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night of Thursday , the F@@ öhn blo@@ ws sometimes with f@@ low@@ ness through the gro@@ wer pe@@ eler .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ing on Thursday morning we cross a strong cold front , which brings strong rain drops , wind gu@@ sts , and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast descent over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southern west @-@ west .
the night@@ mare falls on the night for Wednesday of the F@@ öhn via the valleys .
in the episode , F@@ öhn blo@@ ws up to Thursday morning in the deser@@ ted valleys with ar@@ ches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly with over 100 km / h .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther place now
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of local President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino in the presence of a famous place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , the name of the German Re@@ forms were christ@@ ened on Wednesday .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right next to the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the protest@@ ant church in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret by the centuries .
the place , in a symbolic way , is visi@@ bly clear that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) moder@@ ated as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a sin @-@ bel@@ abel .
his negative impressions will em@@ bol@@ dened him by hist@@ ori@@ ans in its future battle against Rome .
to Luther then , Luther had then initiated the split of the Greenland church with his thes@@ es .
awesome artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) crown is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ay@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and fantasy forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old get - but what is not equal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the particular topics are adjusted , that can quite seem quite gri@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project , which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles are produced cycles that are dedicated to themes such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity .
thus he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : that is true of the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set himself on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
he interpreted the biblical figures that were interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current circumstances . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nest@@ led among the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and each one set of the artist , each expressed his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewel one has golden cou@@ sins .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that listened to the strict Protestant pastor @-@ Order .
&quot; as the up@@ bringing happened to the cane , &quot; she re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to make up this , perhaps to re@@ sign me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to aid the art in fast @-@ life time again : &quot; perception of imag@@ ery is shaped by an advertisement , and this is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images have always a mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; I am a din@@ osau@@ r in this regard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer enter into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them go and see which power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image seek his return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opens on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for lovers of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he can live with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , I have not considered to fully capture the Bible , but it has chosen a mysterious issue for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not working at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about the images explained by the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture @-@ scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find his life deep and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for mo@@ aned both the ( Bible ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and canvas prints - will be presented at an exhibition dedicated to the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company deleg@@ ates , sculp@@ ting for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn , this was already the end .
s@@ ail@@ ings in politics and administration took care of del@@ usion , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
so , hill slo@@ ped , new location wanted - now with formal planning and request@@ ing of building permission .
the approval was published in October , the first newspaper Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was published in the child &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B strengthened commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B has expanded its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundesliga is a significant character in the weekend .
football is respon@@ sive to the situation in Germany , helping the policy help to tackle the problems of coming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the unification of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can tell nobody in principle , that &apos;s nothing . I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested every individual to get this issue in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sely .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Woman Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can help and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must now be policy .
the German Football League has therefore extended its &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; Migration to Refu@@ ge@@ es , and is extended for four years .
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung have assured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; says Nier@@ s@@ bach , on the outskirts of the UEFA session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal agencies also support this program .
this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ dis indicate a clear signal , if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor , &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone can help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everybody , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can take football states , no , we have to use our power , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ina spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
for the European quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
in Nir@@ s@@ bach , the support of refugees marked &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 lic@@ en@@ u@@ alties had started their own projects in their places would be great .
so great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Board of Directors lost an eye to accident
chief of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye from a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when accident has fallen in the case of his brother &apos;s house in the U.S. , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he wore in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on wed@@ nesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ died , was impot@@ ent , has then out and drag@@ ged out onto the road - he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could not do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; he said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s Edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US since the summer , but he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ E without R@@ EU@@ s at Kras@@ no@@ dar - Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes were finally defeated in a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group play of the Europa League .
the national player is also missing the soccer league in the soccer league in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 . / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ cker on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we count towards a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ el will not only change his ancest@@ or on the R@@ EU@@ s position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ en position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of local art@@ ender novel Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher ten@@ ds the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to play in all Europe @-@ League play , , however , Tu@@ kel left it open .
with a high probability he will play the second game as well .
the joint statement by Mit@@ t R@@ EU@@ s said that the final decision for the Bv@@ E must be the goal of the Bv@@ E in the Europe league , holds a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for completing the line @-@ up : &quot; hence , Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead pioneer for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government in Germany , Germany should be the cutting edge .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to display a strategy paper from the House of Transport Finance Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked on Wednesday at the edge of the Auto Show IAA from a &quot; new &quot; mobility era . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the theme with his counter@@ part from the G7 states , which at the IAA came together with representatives from industry .
the strategic paper of the Ministry of Health , among other things , st@@ resses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a generous transfer on digital radio .
testing new technology is currently underway on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional limitation of liability &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government can verify the legal framework conditions and , wherever necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use some international standards that the maximum ad@@ missible speed is increased to speed from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
moreover , the Federal Government seeks to use the amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as a driver .
in the automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process data in seconds .
according to the study , presented by the Ministry of Commerce , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically fe@@ a@@ sible by 2020 .
nevertheless , the vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany assess the study by 2025 to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the pump can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic authority S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in accidents and safety of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on the A review of the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday &apos;s AA ) results in the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent expect that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed until 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital code of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree that control during the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent of all traffic could be present in the flowing traffic , the traffic is 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth would leave control under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ags Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf at the EM competition in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant
it &apos;s a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figures Vic@@ us Cab@@ inet : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ in , which look terri@@ bly with video projec@@ tions .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was created as a great star of the fashion scene , amongst others - so that he put men in the sk@@ irts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I got the enf@@ ant the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be tough , now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is visible from the 18th September in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a fortunate that the fashion designer his initially dimin@@ ishing stance has changed to a show over his person .
actually he had been there , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition was like a bit of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , written by fashion history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship there .
chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is a super@@ bly chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work that has been run for much effort : to fri@@ gh@@ ise the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist is committed .
14 tons of material were drag@@ ged down according to Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot &apos;s cour@@ ier , according to the appointment of Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the October Festival was another pec@@ uli@@ ar : leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first three @-@ known fashion trials of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and in football ) he dressed in his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and Gar@@ ment , Gaul@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the fashion of fashion later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers alike , just as Gaul@@ tier was related in Munich .
later on I bought the one then .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of she@@ dine - Pl@@ zen tip as fashion niche
in the past , the long stit@@ ering machines in and around Pl@@ auen was about to make meter .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in large quantities for customers who work for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the initial hours of the Pl@@ aying tip Fashion played a greater role , then it was pushed to be re@@ discovered by the home textiles industry - and is now discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional trains .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on previous pin shots , an increasing contract potential .
those who are no longer operated in the textiles industry in Germany is no longer available .
they already make half of all the jobs done by us .
desp@@ airing of Pl@@ ush is a member of the industry association Pl@@ aying tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years about 80 per cent of sales have been canc@@ eled .
private specialty shops and also wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products are barely able to reach our customers on this path .
today , the mass @-@ goods are now much cheaper at the Asian region and sold almost exclusively over chains .
in addition , export trading , current to Russia and the US .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score points as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer was declared by the Emb@@ ro@@ dent in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we perform a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
Josef Schmidt teaches at Schnee@@ berger outdoor museum of the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ikes .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , we have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often will varies slightly to keep a customer base .
several years ago fashion designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter will re@@ invent the historic bli@@ sters .
the machine st@@ resses some small cu@@ ffs at some places .
the Pl@@ zen Gold@@ smith @-@ champion Bianca Ho@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se thought : &quot; before , I was able to do nothing with a traditional Pl@@ aying tip . &quot;
now they use the top tip for their jewelry .
she shapes the pattern in silver in an elabor@@ ate process .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ aying tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies you to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors were to have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area .
in this case I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ ate tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends have not to touch but , however , Disney dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not a re @-@ film , but about a kind of sequ@@ el , which is playing 20 years after the first film with the magical little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny and the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is already convinced : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; at the cinema .
XI urged to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to further open from the outside to boost growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on Tuesday of a group commissioned to reform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reform &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should set up for it to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business efforts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start and forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity scene to regul@@ ate the market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ation of the border @-@ controlled policy , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to record private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the local population system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , that identi@@ fies sectors and companies that would not come into question .
the system is gradually being tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of significance , since it claims the market a major role in the al@@ location of resources , a right state of law , and open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers of sub@@ trac@@ ting powers and ensure that companies will decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow limit regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investment and will protect the righ@@ tful interests of foreign trade companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it will be easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by facil@@ it@@ ating the demands and the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were present as announced in one explanation published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to ensure a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; proposed by an actual working paper , critic@@ ised : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , according to the threshold of the nerve centre for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from an to two milli@@ grams of mercury could be increased from one kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strong that mercury are still poll@@ uted with mercury due to the still valid limit values of about 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be possible .
in return for this eas@@ ing , the EU wants to cut threshold values from other fish at present 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch signed this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; due to smaller ones , such as car@@ p usually are bur@@ dened as low as they are already today pres@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore , &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des di@@ stra@@ ction , which alone helps the economy , &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal that supplies over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government proposes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities of particular can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ umwelt@@ amt , at his home page , explains that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury indicated primarily through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as El@@ be , Rhine and Danube have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had quoted expres@@ sing the mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , mercury @-@ wide warnings from mercury in fish were already one of the most reported medical risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
