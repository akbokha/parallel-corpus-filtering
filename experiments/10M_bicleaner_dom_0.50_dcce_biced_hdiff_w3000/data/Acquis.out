( B ) no un@@ due intervention in the peaceful nuclear activities in the community , in particular in the operation of the systems ;
C ) Con@@ vent@@ ing with the che@@ ek of a pru@@ dent operation in line , how they are needed for the economic and ri@@ val@@ ed execution of nuclear activities .
a ) The organisation meets all the precau@@ tions to protect business and industrial secrets as well as other confi@@ dential information , from which it gained knowledge during the implementation of this agreement .
II ) summar@@ ized information about key material , the securing measures after this agreement is subject to decision of the Council and with the consent of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected states or the community , as far as each of the two parties concerned .
a ) With the implementation of securing measures , the technological development will be taken into account in the field of safegu@@ arding measures , and all efforts to ensure optimum cost effectiveness and use of the use of a effective backup policy , which will ensure the optimum cost effectiveness and use of any technical data on certain strategic points , so far as the current or future technology will allow this .
B ) Reg@@ arding the optimal cost effectiveness ( for example , the following methods are used : I ) spatial fing@@ ern@@ ation as a means to define the material notes for accounting purposes ;
III ) Con@@ centr@@ ing the pro@@ ving procedure on the phases of the fuel circulation , which could affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material , provided with no further nuclear weapons and other core prot@@ ectors , provided that this should not hin@@ der the implementation of this agreement .
a ) In accordance with this agreement , the Community of Organization in accordance with this Convention provides information about key material , the securing measures is subject to protection , and concerning the characteristics of the systems that are used for carrying out safety measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang .
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum measurement of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of their tasks according to the Convention .
II ) Information about systems are limited to the minimum dimension , which is subject to the use of securing measures in relation to core material that is subject to securing measures after this agreement is necessary .
C ) In search of the community , the organisation is ready to check the investment data that require the community as particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this data will not need to be transmitted by the organisation unless they remain accessible to further examination by the organization in the community &apos;s premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) i ) The organization brings to the consent of the Community and States for the name of inspec@@ tors for the states .
II ) Expl@@ ore the Community either against a proposed name or at any time against a claimed arrest , so the organization of the Community and the States proposes a or more Alternative items .
III ) If , due to the repeated ref@@ usal of the community , the advice of inspec@@ tors must be imp@@ eded by the organisation of the organisation according to this agreement , the Council becomes ref@@ using to discuss appropriate action in the following as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) The community and the affected states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation may actually be able to force them according to their conven@@ tions .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are designed so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the states and for the inspec@@ tions of peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ tions and other the inspec@@ tors of the organisation is aware of the confi@@ dential information security .
each state is turning towards the organization including its assets , funds , and assets , as well as opposed to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the privileges and deliver@@ ables of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization .
the securing measures after this deal are termin@@ ated in relation to core material , when the community and the organisation have been diluted , that the material has been consumed or diluted in a way that is no longer usable for a nu@@ cle@@ ary activity , which is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ usable .
the Community rati@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to securing measures after this agreement .
the securing measures after this deal are termin@@ ated in relation to core material , as soon as the recipient is provided , as soon as in this Convention , responsibility has taken over responsibility .
the organisation conduc@@ ts documents from which any dis@@ closure and , if necessary , the use of the backup measures on the given core material are highlighted .
should core material , the securing measures after this agreement is subject to agreement on non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agree the community with the organization of such a material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated upon this material in relation to this material .
II ) that the waste material during the duration of the non @-@ application of securing measures after this agreement is not used to produce nuclear weapons and other core prot@@ ections .
B ) The organisation and community meet a regulation in order that the backup measures are not applied for such a long time when the core material is used for such an activity .
in regulation , as far as possible , such securing measures will not be applied , as long as possible .
in any case , the backup measures are once again applied in this Convention as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation will be held by the material and the composition of this material in the respective state or the relevant states of such a material from this state or the states in the current state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it covers only on matters , including temp@@ oral and for@@ en@@ vis@@ ing provisions and di@@ stra@@ ins for reporting , but does not exclu@@ de a trillion or under secret protection of military activity , and does not refer to the following use of the core material .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization , the Community and the States carry the costs which each of them will grow out of their respective comm@@ it@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to its sovereignty , are exceptional costs due to a special seeking of the organisation , the organisation will be ref@@ unded to this cost , if it has been prepared in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisation contributes to the cost of all additional measurements and samples which are demanded from the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability for nu@@ cle@@ ary damage , including insurance or other financial security , will be eligible for the organization and their officials for the purpose of performing this agreement in the same way as the state @-@ members of the states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any claim to the community or a state towards the organisation or the state , against the community or a state due to damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear strike - asser@@ ted that from carrying out the securing measures under this Convention , will be gover@@ ned in accordance with international law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the Council agre@@ es to the exam from the General @-@ General Information , that the organization has not been able to verify that there is no core material that has been imposed upon this Convention , so he can report the rules for nuclear weapons or other core prot@@ ections , so it can also take place in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and where necessary the other measures imposed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such steps , the Council considers that mass was att@@ ained by the applied securing measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every accept@@ ably opportunity to allow the Council to provide the necessary safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on request of the organization , the community or state , consultations on issues are held , which arise from the interpretation or use of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the states are entitled to ensure that questions coming from the interpretation or use of this agreement will be judged by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council encour@@ ages the community and the affected state to participate in discussion of such questions by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the exception of disputes ar@@ ising from the Council to Article 19 or one of the Council &apos;s decisions there are disputes resulting from the interpretation or use of this agreement , or by another of the Organization , the Community and the States , shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal to an arbit@@ ral tribunal , which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the Community and the states ap@@ point two arbit@@ rators , the organization called also two arbit@@ rators , and the four b@@ ump@@ ire judges elect a fifth place , chair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have the Community and the States , or the organization within thirty days after the application , is not named on two arbit@@ rators , so the community or organization may seek the president of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the name or appointment of the fourth Ar@@ bit@@ ters , the fifth arbit@@ rator has not yet been elected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is compl@@ ac@@ ent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the affected states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) This agreement will occur for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract , and the members of the Community , in force , i ) , if the state of the organization has concluded that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into this agreement .
II ) if the Community has declared it , it is capable of applying their backup measures relating to this state to the purpose of this agreement .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this agreement is to specify when implementing the provisions of the Parti@@ al I on securing measures as required .
the aim of securing measures contained in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of nuclear facilities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core prot@@ ectors for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a reduction by the risk of early discovery .
to en@@ force the target set in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a backup of basic importance , associated with spatial inclusion and observation as important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical termin@@ ations of the au@@ dits by the organization is done by a declaration in which for each material bil@@ it@@ ories , the material amount cannot be specified for a given period .
when performing their investigation , the organization makes a full use of Article 3 full use of the backup system .
the accounting and control system of community for core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material notes zones .
with the use of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as required , see how they are defined in the supple@@ mental termin@@ ations .
a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of derived , produced , different , lost or in other ways from the stock of the core material and the stock of stock ;
( B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement in@@ security ;
C ) procedure for determin@@ ing , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipi@@ ents ;
e ) procedure for evalu@@ ating accumulation of non @-@ measured inventory and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which points to all material bil@@ it@@ ories and the changes of this location , including one and ex@@ its of the material bil@@ low zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions , which make sure the book processes and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to reim@@ bur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this conven@@ tions do not extend to material in mining , or the arch preparation .
B ) is an Ur@@ an or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material that has not yet been reached under ( c ) described in the states , the community of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material , unless it is not specifically introduced to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) is the core material that is suitable according to its composition and purity , or the process phase , or the process of process , or is introduced into the States , or will be introduced into a later phase of the nuclear cycle of fuel into the States , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The gover@@ ning measures contained in this Convention are concluded for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . the community is however , that the return of core material , the securing measures after this agreement is subject to pro@@ vision@@ ally not possible or granted , consult the organization and the community over the application of suitable backup measures .
B ) The established safety measures are concluded for core material , under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ refundable .
on request of the Community the Organization exemp@@ t the following core material from securing measures to this Convention :
a ) special dispens@@ able material when it is used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) the core material when it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in Article 13 if such core material is refundable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the Community liber@@ ates the organization core material , which otherwise have been subject to this agreement , from these hed@@ ging measures , unless the whole , due to this article in the states liberated nuclear power amounts to no time more than
a ) A kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material which consists of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated from multip@@ lication of its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates multi@@ plying of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural origin and enriched ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of enriched ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.0@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberated core material , together with core material , is subject to the securing measures after the agreement , are processed or stored , so precau@@ tions are made for the use of securing measures on that material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets with the organization of supple@@ mental abor@@ tions , which is necessary to apply to the successful and effective detection of the tasks of the organization , according to this agreement , in individual procedures , as specified in the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without changing this agreement , the supple@@ ment@@ ing agreements may be extended or changed in agreement between the organization and the community .
at the same time , the supple@@ mentary forms occur at the same time with or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the states may enter into force within nine days after the entry into force of this Agreement between the Organization , the Community and the States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is based on the basis of this agreement in the article 62 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; along the underlying core process of the entire European Convention on Nuclear Research in the States , regardless of its origin , based on the subsequent reports and results of their findings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and their Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ATION NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the international economic cooperation agreement to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resources management problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States , that the entire Member of the Member States is bound by the Member States and as far as possible within two years following entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its best to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the organization have cons@@ ulted each other over the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
to this end , the association of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization prepar@@ es a special account under the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special interaction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; account , which is led by the member states under the special action account ; this account is defined by the organization as Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special action account is separated and managed separately from any other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contributions are to pay as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or fixed debt to the member state , to pay upon request in the currency of the state to Order the organization as Administrator of the Special F@@ TT , and to leave the organization in the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first at a height of at least 45 v . h . the Beit@@ er within 30 days following entry into this agreement or another between the EEC and the Administrator of the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rest of the accession to the 1 . January 1979 , or at another point , agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget .
C ) Every member state can make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
the Administrator pri@@ des in accordance with the usual methods of the organisation about propor@@ tion@@ al draw on cash or school periods to cover the expenses for the special interaction loan and to compens@@ ate the special action account in reasonable manner .
during the grant of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can lead to the conditions of the EEC of the following factors :
III ) contri@@ buting to the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the present and un@@ predictable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the trend of debt service in the country and its further credit capacity to loan loss due to compensation ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned may be regulated by posts from other sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any special action loan is to finance a clear and rep@@ ay@@ able development program or fore@@ hab@@ itation ( including a tor@@ ial pre@@ hab@@ itation ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be a loan program or not , according to the procedure and practices , which is approved for the ordinary means of the organization , which is under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to consider this agreement mentioned above . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funds for the transaction account may not be used instead of a monthly average of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has been approved for a program or loan , which has already been approved by the Directors of the Bank or Organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Section 4 , special interaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , applicable to the organization provided by the organization , they are payable in ten years in 50 years .
special agreements are being granted in one or more member of the member states and are payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay this security guards are directly to the organization that maintains it .
any special interaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from any special action loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient or goods or services that are made ( or produced ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and according to the provision of what the Administrator has specified , the recipient of a special transaction tax could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cash payments of special interaction loans are carried out on the special interaction account , and this way paid back to the currency of a membership state after its input , as soon as possible from the Administrator to the membership state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Administrator is instructed to complete dis@@ closure of all special en@@ forcement loans by the EEC on testing by directors in preparation and by directors approved projects and programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the period of the payout of the Special F@@ TT loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC four@@ tel@@ annually about the development of the special interaction loan and the expend@@ itu@@ res of these expend@@ itu@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the car@@ et@@ akers will soon be transferred to the EEC as soon as possible , according to the conclusion of the financial year of the organisation , an exhau@@ st@@ ive account of the external audit@@ or of the organisation to this account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the proposals , financed by the special en@@ act account , and programs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Administrator created and exec@@ utes suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which contributions to financial account payments received from account to financial obligations , which are paid to the account and the funds allocated to the Member States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EEC and the Administrator , to achieve the goals of this agreement closely together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator of Time to the full edition of the Special F@@ act accounts , financed by the state of special actions , financed programmes or projects and on all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this agreement is on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the organization may agree , not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be due immediately with immediate effect .
if the total capital expenditure of all of the recipi@@ ents agreed in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall end with immediate effect .
this agreement requires author@@ ization by the individual Member States and the EEC as well as the legal provisions of any party .
the governments of the Member States mem@@ ori@@ ze the Council &apos;s Secret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Secretary is leading the notification along with a note about the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month which follows the day of the input of the mentioned notice .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word in@@ explic@@ able .
in the acknowle@@ d@@ gement that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the protocol between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to include the following regulation :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled Nuclear fusion and Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , standing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program covers the creation of a large test facility , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Common Company , according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty , is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Community J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several years , Switzerland deals with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ k and is well familiar with the respective area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since until practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion are still extensive work carried out , it is in the interests of the contract parties to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts and their respective research institutions , which have achieved higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement should enable any contrac@@ ting party to prevent due to its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k , to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts and the common objective of this research project , i.e. , the cost @-@ effective electri@@ fication generation by using the controlled kernel reaction to reach faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve the aim of this agreement , the parties associate their respective App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Program . &quot;
to ensure an effective collaboration , the Swiss program ass@@ umes the long @-@ term goals and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or changed after testing in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present @-@ mentioned organs that may include new activities that are relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time , when the parties accept a new program , this will apply to the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the Association proposed in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of any of the contrac@@ ting parties during preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of the staff among the related laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland , and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has closed a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratory , associated with the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the scope of this agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project J@@ ET .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Association proposed in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the parties concluded an association agreement , standing as far as possible , which is named between the Commission and the States , or persons , standing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; standing on the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom is concerned with the same objective of concern that Switzerland is involved with the signing of the agreement on the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agre@@ ements on Human Change &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the current agreement of the Common Company J@@ ET , its stat@@ ute shall be accepted by the Stat@@ utes .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom carries a concern that Switzerland will be contrac@@ ting to contract any contract , except association agreements or other similar contracts , which will be closed by Eur@@ atom during the validity of this agreement .
the association , which are designated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Association , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
the association agreement therefore regard the en@@ forcement of a steering committee prior to the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- the development of research projects to monitor and to direct how best results can be achieved in line with the aims of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by most two deleg@@ ates used in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme - including the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ G , which has the exchange of information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , takes this task regarding all research and development activities , to which this agreement applies .
it promotes the cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts their T * in the interests of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom programme and in Article 1 of this agreement posted joint target , whereby the scientific and technological developments are subject to significant scientific and technological developments in the world .
according to its Rules of Pro@@ cedure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent national authorities are looking for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advis@@ ers that submitted the V@@ G research proposals to ensure the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom Programme , taking this task in terms of research and development work , which is related to the agreement in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the directors of directors who will monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and responsible for it , that the capacity of the laboratory , which are involved in the framework of the program , will be able to work optimally for all research and development projects , which fall under the present agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cares in particular for the best possible use of the personnel and for exchange of the same between the laboratories , involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program .

a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is the anti@@ bodies or any other on the label specified .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) h@@ ul@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured twice as double in a suitable medium through ever renewed re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation .
the Tit@@ er is the recur@@ ren@@ al value of the strongest serum di@@ lu@@ te in which a reaction is occurring ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively to the volume of blood contamination in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B , or other reag@@ ents that are used on object types , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the blood group determination , and for reag@@ ents of other specif@@ icity .
according to definition , a certain number of international items per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most specif@@ icity is expressed as a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ al@@ ite which is observed in a series of di@@ lution with er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic floo@@ ding .
the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture inside a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , for which International standard preparations are present ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International Standard of Un@@ ag@@ enz@@ ie in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you are bringing them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B can contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are free of charge from the international laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative tit@@ ration of the international standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent in the form according to the label is at most a year after the last satis@@ fying efficacy .
preventing the exp@@ iry date for dry conditions is based on the results of the holding tests ; it is approved by the state authority authorities .
dry re@@ pres@@ ets are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum container , in which they have been dried , and that is so closed , so that no humidity can enter .
a drying process may lose at most 0,5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ orus plat@@ inum at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or which is added to the d@@ rought ) is an ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tic and / or anti@@ biotic , if the reag@@ ent with the added substance remains the requirements for specif@@ icity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml , or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
reag@@ ents , equally valid , whether in flu@@ oride form or after re@@ resolution , must be transparent and may contain neither se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
as possible for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination , should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least as long as the International Convention has come about a single system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are used in such a way and in such quantities , that in a container , the reag@@ ent is not only sufficient to carry tests with unknown blood cells , but also for performing tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so great that the content may be used if necessary , in this protocol , the efficiency tests described in this protocol can be used .
the manufacturer @-@ Lab has written about all production levels and controls to the reag@@ ents of written records .
adequate samples of all given reag@@ ents are so long to retain from the lab , until some lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood may be assumed that the charge is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for the blood group can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary remedies for rein@@ forcement of effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of their effectiveness .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contains only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each single box a black printed label is available in English and French . the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , for dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed ,
furthermore , this label or label has on the box in which the individual container are located , or those used for the containers enclosed : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed ,
each mission is to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to this protocol .

an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the dissolved , but undes@@ irable international standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding compar@@ ative par@@ at against a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the double period , but the same attempt to be dissolved by the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparations of same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons in group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum , glut@@ inin of human red blood cells , which contain Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including the Sub@@ group A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it contains no human red blood cells , which contain no Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it is glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally excluded by anti @-@ A serum for group B non @-@ glut@@ amine ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations for anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding figure , separated against the floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to de@@ fun@@ ct , but diluted according to the international standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding figure of therapy for a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of ser@@ ums may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also produce a easily identi@@ fi@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination will occur within the double period , but the same attempts to be dissolved , but un@@ diluted oral standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard prepared for equal activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the double period , but the same attempt to de@@ sol@@ ate the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard preparations of same avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flow of blood cells ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specif@@ icity can be one of two species that are distinguished by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others , which are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are scre@@ ened in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be changed if International standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is derived from the blood of one or several persons who are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells , which do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.0@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations for the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ ums or a corresponding figure towards C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react according to blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen , react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are destined for the use of object types according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells at about 40 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or several persons , which are immun@@ ized by the glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells , which do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specifically specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells were reduced in a 0.0@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ cd@@ dee &apos;s blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object classes according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of an anti @-@ D blood cells ) , have to be mixed with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of the visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is gained from the blood of one or several persons who are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h @-@ System .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object classes according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form Anti @-@ D ) must be mixed with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent reduction of C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e @-@ blood cells , within 30 seconds to have completed a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of specif@@ icity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specif@@ icity anti @-@ D + E can be gained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by anti @-@ D or anti @-@ C serum .
in a given serum , both anti@@ bodies must be effective under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use is determined according to the test after Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous time of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be smaller than in the ant@@ agon@@ anti@@ bodies .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ized through blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum acts of human red blood cells , the A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is composed of the blood groups A and AB , including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it is glut@@ inin not human red blood cells , which contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is the cause of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but undes@@ irable international standard preparations for anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding figure , separated with the floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A serum is shu@@ ff@@ led in an object carrier with equal quantity of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flow of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination is needed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard preparations of same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is derived from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of blood type B .
anti @-@ B serum co@@ engine@@ ered human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is composed of the blood groups of B and AB ; it is glut@@ inin not human blood cells containing no B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is not the ones of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding figure , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells in group B to tit@@ rate ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent reduction of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within a double period , but if the same attempt to sol@@ vent the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparations of same avi@@ d is performed .
anti @-@ Human Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ izing antibody against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ izing antibody against comple@@ mentary factors .
it is gained from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injec@@ ting human serum .
if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s provision , there are no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , in@@ different to which blood group they belong .

the members of the DI@@ ES@@ ES Convention , which has been developed under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for cooperation in the territory of the Cust@@ oms Union -
in DE@@ M desire to facilitate the compar@@ ing and values of statistical data , especially those of international trade ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in DE@@ M desire to reduce costs , which means that in international trade traffic goods have to be newly designated in a transition from a classification system to another new , and to facilitate the compatibility of trade documents and transmission of data , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in THE ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ IN@@ EM@@ ENT that the development of technology and structures of the international trade will make significant changes in the Brussels Treaty of Brussels on 15 December 1950 concerning the customs tariff for the import of goods to customs tari@@ ffs ,
furthermore , IN THE ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ER , that by the governments and the economy for customs tari@@ ffs and for statistical purposes , the measure of differentiation is currently far beyond that which is contained in the grounds of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned agreement ,
in THE EV@@ IL , that it is important to have international trade negotiations about accurate and comparable data ,
in DER ER@@ WA@@ R , that the harmon@@ ised system for freight rates and traffic statistics of different transport modes are to be used ,
in THE ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ATION that the harmon@@ ised system is determined , as far as possible to use in the trade used systems for the name and coding of the goods ,
in THE ER@@ WA@@ PO@@ TION , that the harmon@@ ised system is to contribute to a close relationship between the import and export trade statistics on the other hand , IN DER ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ATION , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International commodity directory for foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) shall be accepted ,
in THE ER@@ WA@@ PO@@ TION , that it is desirable to meet the above @-@ mentioned demands by a combined customs tariff and statistical presentation that is used for use by the international trade involved .
in THE EV@@ IL , that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and structures of international trade ,
