it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Zip thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ ities ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal stron@@ gh@@ olds ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat severe and heavier man@@ ic episodes and for prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for rapid control of ei@@ vable un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral problems , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for intake or melting tablet in patients may be used to make the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
for patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works primarily as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter seems to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ appearance is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms , has been examined in three studies by up to one year .
in two studies , the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo who have been stabili@@ zed in 160 patients with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ation solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which are caused by irrit@@ ant un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment were examined .
the company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablet and the solution to absorb ( decre@@ asing ) .
in both studies with the injection solution patients , the Abi@@ li@@ fy patients showed in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms caused by un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
when applying the bi@@ polar disorder treatment , Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo perceived man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also been more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pol@@ ari@@ dale , head@@ ache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting and exhau@@ st@@ ion , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared with the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased im@@ itation and behavi@@ oral problems in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance when oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate @-@ heavy episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
a increased efficacy in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as a mono@@ or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y &apos;s efficacy in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , lower initi@@ als should be considered in consideration if clinical factors just@@ i@@ fies this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases following an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution when patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ disp@@ ose ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less permanent , there were occa@@ sional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in treatment during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late @-@ dy@@ sent@@ in@@ ae should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient sign signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set off .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with cr@@ ut@@ ants in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in conditions associated with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the connection for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose values .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lay side effects as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( quin@@ id@@ ine ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ zing , the common application can result from CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma cent@@ ages from Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ zing .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after ab@@ etting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be upgraded to the dose prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be regarded as a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Methodi@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if you are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient data position for safety when human being caused by the animal &apos;s concerns , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using hazardous machines , including motor vehicles to use until they are safe , that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following side effects come more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis were treated compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in cases under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ el@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or int@@ enti@@ onal over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma rot@@ ates .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ ut@@ er@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ ches @-@ Emission Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the ties of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or lig@@ ands , at the nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen .
in three placebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of the responded to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sau@@ - depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % under placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ine @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involving sch@@ izophren@@ ia above 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the starting value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 6 % ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ xide studies with a flexible dosage for 3 weeks with man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior effectiveness in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo controlled mono@@ xide study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect , comparable to which of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also proved a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on how to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of more than 6 weeks with man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found a superior effectiveness in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherap@@ ies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 74 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar back , predominantly in prevention of a back in the mania .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the mean elim@@ ination time of life is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ zing over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , and also showed no gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study .
a pop@@ ulation @-@ specific analysis of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study involving subjects with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety checks , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ idal significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

in a Ol@@ anz@@ ine @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involving sch@@ izophren@@ ia above 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the starting value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 6 % ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form was compared to healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys to repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose on humans based on mg / m2 ) .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of aggres@@ si@@ vity and behavior of patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment can be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circul@@ ating adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given in consideration of the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines referred to as provided or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y refined tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solutions to intake .
there are no investigations into the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral problems , which were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition to a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
exam@@ inations on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by sp@@ elling or illegal pharmac@@ euticals ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution when patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ disp@@ ose ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late ) Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less permanent , there were occa@@ sional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifest@@ ations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscular sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness , and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ities or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , per@@ spiration and heart rhythm disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose values .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which gain weight gain as side effect and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) as a one @-@ time in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ aire ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ zing the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma centre of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ eases , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after ab@@ etting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be upgraded to the dose prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , was the intensity of se@@ gregation larger compared to the sole treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects come more frequently on ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) as possible clinical studies ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ el@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces had been compared with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ itation / behavi@@ ors compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in symptoms regarding placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement of the starting value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient figure .
in three placebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of the responded to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ine @-@ controlled , multin@@ ation@@ als double @-@ blind study involving sch@@ izophren@@ ia above 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients suffering from at least 7 % compared to the starting value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 6 % ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of patients with man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found a superior effectiveness in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherap@@ ies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in some cases , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar back , predominantly in prevention of a back in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of 90 % larger the AU@@ C after the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects the average time to reach the maximum plasma membrane is 1 @-@ 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys in any direct tox@@ icity of a target , according to a systematic exposure of a systematic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the reproduction of the intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns were obtained after mat@@ ernity exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) for the maximum therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for the security of safety , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the pre @-@ clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ idal significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects embra@@ ced a dos@@ ing @-@ per@@ oid of adren@@ al tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ kidney disease ) in rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle ti@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , a cholesterol @-@ based hydro@@ xy@@ cyc@@ asis was determined by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys to repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average maximum dose on humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which lead to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study that participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole treatment or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional packing ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , conventional packing and conventional treatment .
consider only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of efficacy of disease and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously had previously treated other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it must also not be used in patients who have silent or before the beginning of the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es in the blood .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no longer effective in patients with which the first treatment has not been given more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs containing other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted an approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ containing therapy is not displayed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ie &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavy sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy while the cu@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 the treatment is reduced , until an improvement is achieved at level 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is no sufficient data on the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ ations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of non @-@ sufficient data for dis@@ comfort and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ o@@ arti@@ stry form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be taken immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed cu@@ x@@ ane therapy cycles should be initiated again until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the rate of thes@@ es has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear@@ er with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not proven , cardi@@ ovascular inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anthrop@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and sty@@ lizing means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used at pregnant or for women in a weak age that do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in poor age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable processing method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will become pregnant , during and up to six months after treatment not a child .
male patients should advise in the treatment of a sper@@ mac@@ ular surface , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can work on the transport and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in the piv@@ ot@@ al phase III study of 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 cu@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( with 79 % of patients reported ) and was rapidly re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) in three cases .
in Table 1 , the side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication of studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma welding into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transportation is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ recept@@ or and due to the Albanian protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurring in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two ar@@ dy @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients that were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparison study .
in one study 43 patients treated with metastatic breast cancer with a cu@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour In@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
for inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ones .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy while 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy ; 40 % for metast@@ ases and 19 % for met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity towards Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the enhancement of a degree for patients who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 during the therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for bott@@ oms on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of cu@@ x@@ ane by &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 has been determined in clinical trials .
active exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation was increased in a multi@@ ph@@ asing way .
the medium volume of the distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ out connection of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el have been compared to intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute In@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was cu@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver microphones and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ lized - hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 cu@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the average total of 4 % of the given total dose amounted to less than 1 % of the metabolism 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , over the age of more than 75 years , only a few dates are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected above 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood tests that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if before the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who wish to make their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or his advisor status , provided that they have received an appropriate manual .
patients with chronic kidney disease or patients who receive chemotherapy should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is , and ice @-@ energy agents should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or so that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used before operations to increase the amount of blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by one cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was administered by appointment as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who caused an@@ emia caused by genetic problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin spra@@ yed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values of patients , which were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , were treated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , coll@@ ateral mig@@ rating and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection underneath the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as other studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Ab@@ se@@ amed has been provided for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the Company , Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the medical staff in all Member States , including information about the security of the medicine .
in August 2007 the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG granted permission for transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed to the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi @-@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion ( e.g. cardi@@ ovascular status , existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) exists .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency , if they are not available to have a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for a reduction by foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of transfer@@ sion compensation is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be used not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood ende@@ avor program .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for di@@ abe@@ tic patients who should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms vary depending on the age , gender and total disease majority ; therefore evalu@@ ating the individual clinical course and disease condition are required .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values can be observed during one patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be carried out by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value is more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin wert is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest allowed dose which is necessary for the control of an@@ emia and angi@@ om@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose of 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of dose of 25 to E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
treatment symptoms vary depending on the age , gender and total disease last ; therefore evalu@@ ating the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
given this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be carried out by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be monitored mes@@ h@@ ed to ensure that ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest allowed dose which is needed for the control of the symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be kept from 150 to E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ g@@ ons &lt; 0.0@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 treatment weeks of 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin / dl ( ≥ 0.0@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reag@@ ent number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased , the dose should be kept from 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
however , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ g@@ ums increased by &lt; 0.0@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to the ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is required for the pre@@ dispos@@ ition of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ atives , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
with iron subst@@ itution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ate program - started at the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy large iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , which should be given weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and the day of the intervention ( Day 0 ) .

if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of potential thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ie@@ al an@@ emia - dos@@ ing with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a util@@ isation risk reduction in particular patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger medical orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa drugs , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery , should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in a underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an initial volume of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can pers@@ ist .

when adding or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed to consider the potassium values back in the norm range .
if you suffer chronic kidney stones and so@@ oner obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust mark by in@@ sufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , it is not accelerated by the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be taken into account for assess@@ ing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly indicate your values in the red blood @-@ colour@@ ing ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose according to the risk of blood glucose ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed from the advantages taken from the treatment with ep@@ ic@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa drugs , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , i.e. , if you have had an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous kidney stones or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed can affect a growth factor for blood cells and influence the tumor in certain circumstances .
if a major orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery is im@@ min@@ ated , before the treatment of abor@@ tion , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood color ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood glucose after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you use other medicines and have applied / applied before it , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ression the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may order certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ is .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high risk of frac@@ turing ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic r@@ ushing defeat as in the case ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should have a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) in the three days after in@@ fusion are occurring symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was attracted to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study involved 2 127 male and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis for 50 years , which had recently suffered a joint fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
basic indi@@ k@@ ator for efficacy was whether the concentration of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which ab@@ uses bone structure ) in the blood again , or by at least 75 % over the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of ed@@ itary cultures was reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion outlet and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( dying from bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physi@@ cians to prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Novartis Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the deployment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in males , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic r@@ hes@@ ion , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip fra@@ cture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long re@@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the treatment of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience can be found for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients are similar to younger .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data are absent for dis@@ comfort and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney disease ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as there are only limited clinical experience for this patient population .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the beginning of the treatment with as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid on bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ critical hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be developed , which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.8 ) .
additionally , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental investigation with adequate pre@@ ventive denti@@ stry .
for patients that require dental handles , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw range .
the clinical assessment by the doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms resulting within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the treatment of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported cases of atri@@ al fibrill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the sti@@ ff@@ ness of atri@@ al fibrill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occa@@ sional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted medication actions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al impair@@ ment Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. increasing the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( formerly measured before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were comparable to o@@ steopor@@ osis for three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ astic and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on assess@@ ing the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values occur below 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get study .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical fra@@ ctions according to a fra@@ ction of frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical fra@@ cture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion outlet such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw range has been reported primarily for cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw range ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer patients by tooth extraction or other dental laboratories .

in case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be att@@ ained by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) the efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year was observed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) and a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spinal fluid .
effects on morph@@ ometric flu@@ oride frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sen@@ ate significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spine ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of flu@@ ffy frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a rejected an equally permanent effect over three years , representing 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip is 6.0 % , the string bag by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .

in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer@@ ized tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the intra@@ ocular bone @-@ volume and receiving the intra@@ ocular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the serum @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , serum and beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were evaluated in groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time units compared to placebo .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in the overall r@@ ushes and 4.3 % at the string .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised 508 men , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ cture in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ cture was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study with men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was used as opposed to the once weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change in the len@@ bel BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting value .
clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the median serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ multiple up to 3.@@ 0@@ times of age @-@ specific upper normal @-@ value at intake in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid compared to the consumption of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparison studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain strength and pain @-@ influenced compared to bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients suffering from the end of the six month study were classified as Respon@@ sibility ( based on therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up period .

in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearing amounts regardless of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against time ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Not@@ ification Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained by the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( in particular overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( Du@@ al@@ Therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide or insulin delivery , the present dose of the sul@@ fa drugs may be retained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sulph@@ ate substance or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be utilized better , and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ ate in triple therapy has been studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ co@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) that shows how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value that leaves the blood sugar levels to be reduced by 15 mg , 30@@ mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the triple therapy trial the effect of an additional administration of acet@@ in and a sul@@ fa drugs result in a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value by 0,@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been examined in 289 patients , the Ac@@ tos increased in addition to insulin delivery of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( common col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may neither be used in patients who may react to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic ve@@ to ( acid level - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos can serve as part of a mon@@ otherap@@ ist ( with sole use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to launch Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequ@@ ately adjusted and in@@ appropriate for those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or Ö@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and Ö@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing more advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T @-@ mirrors are increased to the 3 @-@ fold threshold of the standard range , the Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient develop symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver levels .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory &apos;s laboratory parameters should be conducted by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which may be absorbed by fat cells and in some cases linked to a liquid projection .
as a result of a hem@@ modi@@ fier , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fa drugs or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
following the launch of the market with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported by a reduction or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular hole .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , however , the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms should be aware of the possibility of investig@@ ating the visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages unwanted , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years for analysis of cardi@@ ovascular events , compet@@ encies in patients were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter this one , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on study of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one had no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interaction with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ist are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the extent that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ ins@@ an@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother is dimin@@ ished and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refra@@ c@@ tive index of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents stepped across the three times the upper limit of the norm range , but less rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ener .
in an outcomes research in patients with pre @-@ existing more advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ v .
since the market launch , rarely over heart failure was reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it was conducted an overall analysis of messages of adverse events in randomised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the study period of 3.5 years of running PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ystem in case of a insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ocide ) .
in a placebo controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequ@@ ately adjusted according to insulin had been random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0,@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to get insulin ; a reduction in the insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statist@@ ically significant decline of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quota compared to output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week test analysis of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tik@@ ern .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mas and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statist@@ ically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ ic@@ idal values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the vig@@ orous tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des but also improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de level , this has a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a cardi@@ ovascular outcomes , had been random@@ ized 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing more advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is rapidly absorbed , where the peak concentrations were obtained via un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma normally 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ an had no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the mac@@ ular hole of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
following oral use of radioactive material Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in man , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the threads ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of or@@ als of the oral substance is similar .
tox@@ ic@@ ological studies have occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after the repeated plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ at@@ esta , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the extent that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ an@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother is dimin@@ ished and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epithel@@ ium induced .
in a model of famili@@ al poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years for analysis of cardi@@ ovascular events , compet@@ encies in patients were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statist@@ ically significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quota compared to output values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the vig@@ orous tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de level , this has a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ nostic d synthesis .
although the study lacked the aim of its primary end@@ point , a combination of overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , lay out the results close that the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one are not linked to cardi@@ ovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was able to produce a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ co@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indic@@ ating how good blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels have been reduced similar to other humanity .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to humanity ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane could possibly be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the packages . )
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes regarding the risks conce@@ aled .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for deployment of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a fast initi@@ ale effect is requested with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle must leave at least 6 seconds under the skin for a minimum of 6 seconds to ensure the whole dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar should be significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia haz@@ ard symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( rapid acting , bi@@ phy@@ tic , long @-@ effective insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin of animal origin ) may result in a change of dosage .
if the changes to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required when using a dose of dos@@ ing , this can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients showed hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from human insulin to human insulin , that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before travel , going through several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to catch the advice of his doctor , as such journeys could lead to insulin and meals to other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interaction in therapy and ask his patients to other drugs taken by them .

this document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which is explained how the Committee for Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the study carried out regarding the use of the drug .
the investig@@ ative effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin ( human DNA ) , is produced with the process of &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non commercial ( only ) the EMEA is - How was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ p@@ id could possibly be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for deployment of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin had been eff@@ ected .

if the measurement of the ureth@@ ra is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , genetic cases may still occur ; therefore , the patient is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , nor more medicines for prevention of exposure .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had a tran@@ splantation , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( placebo ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second trial , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
basic indic@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose measurement of urea was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ ur@@ ic had a dose of 80 mg of patients , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily had a measurement of 120 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart pain in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lo@@ wering of the ureth@@ ra in blood , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in illness , which have already led to urine samples ( including one from the medical history , or currently available in se@@ al@@ er@@ ation and / or se@@ al@@ ant arthritis ) .
if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid level is still 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients suffering from severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .

liver disease During clinical trials of Phase 3 , slight ab@@ normal@@ ities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was were no interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ shirt can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous treatment of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

the primary efficacy of the patient was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three months of certain serum were given at least 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a Ser@@ um@@ at@@ in@@ ine to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in terms of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x a day , as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional boxes Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had one Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months decreased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) that would require less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a coating ) .
this was associated with a reduction of se@@ al@@ er@@ no@@ des associated with 54 % of patients who had a complete dis@@ appearance of per month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma platform ( C@@ max ) and the area below the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased by F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration simpler and multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses .

the plasma rot@@ ates from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary li@@ aison to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is controlled by the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver microphones showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are produced mainly through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id occurs mainly through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ zed F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at found approximately 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as further unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine itself , about 45 % of the dose in the chair have found itself as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metast@@ ases ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at changed to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 fold from 7.5 μ g . h / ml in the group with normal kidney function at 13.@@ 2 μ g . h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver functions after intake of multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification ) changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ification and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fer@@ ti@@ bility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , approximately at 4 times of the human@@ ist exposure , maternal tox@@ icity occurred , the one came in with a decrease of the adv@@ ent performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions that were about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that lived about 13 times the human@@ istic exposure , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects were given .

21 Open long term extension studies In open long @-@ term extension studies were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy of the patient was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three months of certain serum were given at least 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months decreased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) that would require less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a coating ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk of low vitamin D levels exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inhal@@ ing other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not stand up until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest after 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than for those used exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s income ( 32 % ) .
the company also suggested that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is equivalent to the dose , which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the drug apparatus ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ive apparatus ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , hydr@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( fl@@ aps ) , ul@@ cers ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed stomach ) , and acid down .
patients with high sensitivity to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , Vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who do not stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or inhal@@ ation of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day .
the following critics are to be exact to reduce the risk of os@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as est@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital order ) .
the doctor should therefore carefully consider all signs and symptoms that point out to possible ab@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ spher@@ es , pain while swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ ally pain or a new or accum@@ ulate so@@ d@@ iness to catch the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy rainf@@ all side effects appears to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occur@@ ence of symptoms that lead to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue to take on .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing procedures will be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ c@@ rose of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients , primarily intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to determine if the ab@@ uses of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the doctor treating the doctor is decisive for the therapy plan for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to have taken the pill after taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to have the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their se@@ eding .
you should not take two tablets a day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the intended week of the week .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before they use other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly affected effects in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation was submitted , with the application of Ad@@ vaginal raf introduced with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ a .
main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients during which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was coordinated after a duration of a year ( for example , how often a new organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been performed on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splantation and examined , as Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

in patients with high sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid anti@@ biotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of other components may not be used .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Ad@@ vaginal raf , as the Ad@@ vaginal sex dose or the dose of the same medication should be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ant therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patient should make this medicine or make changes in the immune response .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant rep@@ ul@@ sions or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; stimulation of the form@@ ulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under primary control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medicine ( see section 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ages must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vaginal raf should be primarily based on clinical diagnosis of degra@@ ding and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the System@@ ic exposure was measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and le@@ ber@@ ran@@ spl@@ anted patients .
careful and repeated inspection of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Ad@@ vaginal raf , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , can take an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ ado several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition allows no oral intake of medicines in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) .
duration of application to supp@@ ression the tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ rep@@ ul@@ ant must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .

further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stab@@ i@@ lization of the patient .
dos@@ ing ages - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant cor@@ nea treatment should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose is to be done .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily , the treatment with liver tran@@ splantation is recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ fts .
du@@ tran@@ splantation In adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vaginal , is an oral initi@@ ation of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recept@@ ors if there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ spl@@ anted patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ age custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining a blood @-@ term mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function problems .
patients with reduced kidney function , since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can assume that a dose of dose is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including regular determin@@ ing of the serum lending , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the urine ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In case of converting a Cic@@ los@@ o to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the bottom level at full blood . the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of degra@@ ding and toler@@ ability in isolated from blood @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ mirror controls .
recommended controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood levels from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be used after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ age adaptation , changes of immune response , or when applying the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorou@@ gh@@ al concentration . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal raf is a medicines with a low clearing , the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies conclude that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level is not higher in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually located in the first time following liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for decor@@ ating - and heart @-@ spl@@ anted patients at 10 @-@ 20 ng / ml .
normally blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used during the subsequent detection of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac gra@@ fts .
this has lead to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in the result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; stimulation of the form@@ ulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under primary control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rep@@ ul@@ ant which has proven to be used against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as therap@@ ist , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ gra@@ fts in adult cardi@@ ac gra@@ fts and tran@@ spl@@ ants are still no clinical data for ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
because of possible inter@@ actions that lead to a reduction in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the tac@@ tic effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain , or other plant enh@@ ances during a treatment with Ad@@ vaginal raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subjected to considerable vibrations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was observed as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vaginal raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorder is an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil .
as with other immune supp@@ res@@ sources , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection due to a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of Pre@@ s like head@@ aches , altered levels of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision could show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal , hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the current administration of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to monitor and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentration levels ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was observed with anti@@ fung@@ ot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluor@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ biotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulting from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P3@@ A4 which can affect your metabolism .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduces the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increasing the hormon@@ al exposition , is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions about recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments showed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their sem@@ esters time .
the results of a low number of investigations on tran@@ spl@@ ants have no indication that below Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events relating to the course and the result of pregnancy .

infections and paras@@ itic diseases How to know , in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is often increased to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ics , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated dual focal corne@@ al leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vaginal raf .
it has been reported for ben@@ ign diseases including EB@@ V@@ - associated lympho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumor in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able .

overall the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f expressed in these published studies the observ@@ ations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f is applied with liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants to primary immune response .
lung tran@@ splantation In an interim analysis about a recently performed , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to have been reported using either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ a in the context of 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization .
chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant tum@@ ul@@ atory syndrome , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis , was also less common in the first year after tran@@ splantation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , patients treated in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases in the emergence of a bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis in comparison to 3@@ 8,0 % below Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ is had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ant tum@@ ul@@ atory occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,7 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was significantly smaller with the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multic@@ entr@@ al study of oral pro@@ gra@@ ft was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously subjected to a pancre@@ atic and kidney tran@@ splantation , which received random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII un@@ conditional , con@@ genital hem@@ or@@ atory disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of use will then determine if advoc@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ings such as bleeding within the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but based on a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , which they em@@ powered to the formation of the human cl@@ ot@@ ment factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union , re@@ combin@@ ate , similar , it is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe and moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated as prevention of blood vessels as well as surgical intervention .
in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood levels were awarded &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any other component .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2004 the European Commission granted approval for the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ oc@@ ate Adv@@ oc@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of subst@@ itution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , after the place and sever@@ ity of blood and clinical condition of the patient .
with the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma stem ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection of all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over for the patient .
during treatment it is used to control the dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma ins@@ ulates .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses ranging between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII should not be reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the agreement is expected to be determined by the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , of which the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is most important and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positi@@ st@@ agen and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors are observed .
due to the rare rising of the H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A women &apos;s rare event , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the biggest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which exhibit at previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

based on the evaluation of available data , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as a positive , but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security profiles of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a sub@@ set of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s all 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder is supposed to apply for another 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited shared the Committee on Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) , that the Company has its request on approval for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
however , the breast , the brain , bone or soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surro@@ unds and relies ) are affected .
it is a kind of virus that was genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so there was no copies of yourself and thus cannot solve infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body &apos;s p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ d @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient before Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP replies the answers to the questions posed by the company , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the evaluation of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP submitted 120 list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not adequ@@ ately proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will bring benefits for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with patients .
the company did not notice CH@@ MP , not knowing whether the feedback has consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active agent release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so comp@@ o@@ unded so that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly em@@ itted for some hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen of the nose @-@ nose ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible , once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ critical symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
with cont@@ empl@@ ation of all ha@@ ylo@@ graph symptoms , the patients that aer@@ in@@ aze were reported , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients suffering from the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( calls , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used to patients who are possibly more sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients that are used to rep@@ aid agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for treatment of aller@@ gies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ eck glaucoma ( higher eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ic ( over@@ function of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have already had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or a risk for ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to appro@@ ve aer@@ in@@ aze on the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is basically to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them bite , break down or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used due to lack of data to in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long term application can take the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time .
after slow@@ ing down the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutic .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ xide oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ als such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ pl@@ erg@@ y@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , n@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and are not enough to express appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about the treatment when treating a hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ ometer , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digital is • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in angi@@ ogen@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is present at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine should otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their scale .
in the scope of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the plasma centre of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated patients were ir@@ respective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ hib@@ its ine @-@ vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison with the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , this can lead to impair@@ ment of accidents or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovascular coll@@ aps ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .
head@@ aches , anxiety , ar@@ ous@@ nesses and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ dominant pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ ax@@ ia , optic nerve and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely , as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il and di@@ dil@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of adhes@@ ion of the P sel@@ ec@@ in to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in one single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow rates including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further person@@ alized effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were determined based on the total co@@ res for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ quad@@ r@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the sw@@ ell@@ ant effect , determined by the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ c@@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ ies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is present within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow rate of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional dos@@ ing study , which was performed by form@@ ulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects suffered dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly .
a component @-@ action study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole treatment of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was the exposure of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety levels , for tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , for genetic ox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can be seen with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , no particular dangers for human beings .
the combination possessed no larger tox@@ icity as its individual components , and the observed effects generally stood in connection with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ producing x@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral treatment of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .
March 2007 , and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 , the regulatory amend@@ ment described is established and works , before and while the product is on the market .

inform your doctor if under the use of aer@@ in@@ aze you may occur or diagnosed with symptoms of aer@@ in@@ aze • blood ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ ache , or a gain of existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
transport and maintenance of machines when applying for application in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ aze does not lead or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze , than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you took a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible , and turn the next dose at the intended time .

according to the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath @-@ not , wh@@ ist@@ ling , it@@ ching , hi@@ ch@@ hi@@ kes and swelling ) or skin rash were reported .
more cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , muscle pain , cr@@ ut@@ ness , pain problems , cases of liver inflammation and over cases of striking liver values were also rarely reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg of melting tablet ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup .
for children aged six to eleven years , dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal allergy @-@ r@@ hin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by adjusting the alter@@ ation of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to reflect that the body util@@ ises the syrup , the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were at a mean decrease in the symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the patients who received a placebo .
in both trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to patients treated with placebo was 40 and 33 % compared with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or any other parts .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the European Commission to appro@@ ve A@@ eri@@ us transport network in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in the youth of 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to previous symptoms and can be resumed after re@@ signing the symptoms .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the all@@ y@@ day period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets that er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of the current consumption of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the effective effects of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , this can lead to impair@@ ment of accidents or ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion of P sel@@ ect@@ in to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was given .
in a single dos@@ sier study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow rates including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ eses , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ence and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching to the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may also be sub@@ divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as using the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the pollution caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria is representative of further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spective pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ gen@@ ic diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is in addition to the chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ch@@ ur@@ itus , and the reduction in size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ ing interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients , who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable to patients suffering from the general seas@@ on@@ ally allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in the population of 4 % , was reached with a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in enzyme , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in vivo not hem@@ med CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty acid rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no quality or quantitative differences concerning the tox@@ icity profiles of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on safety levels , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can be recognized by dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
coloured film ( contains L@@ act@@ ose mon@@ oh@@ ydr@@ ate , hypo@@ cr@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ RNA , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , cat@@ aly@@ st wax .
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bers doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available , which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , angi@@ ogen@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ li@@ at@@ ad@@ in constra@@ ined and experienced a higher subst@@ itution ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which constra@@ ined met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze , is identical to those with children who are normal met@@ abo@@ lized .
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take any inher@@ ent problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of the current consumption of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the effective effects of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us syrup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study of multiple adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was revealed .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or in clinical trials .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol , neither to a gain of alcohol @-@ induced loss reductions or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ eses , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ence and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching to the pal@@ ate .
as using the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduces the seas@@ on@@ ally allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ch@@ ur@@ itus , and the reduction in size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ ing interval .
the dis@@ semin@@ ation of this fully met@@ abo@@ lized phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ asi@@ ers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , that are fully met@@ abo@@ lized met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us syrup is offered in type III brown glass bottles with a secure polypropylene @-@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 , and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also used ( see section 5.1 ) .
for clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at has been well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examination , vital symbols and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied more than 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ eses , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ence and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching to the pal@@ ate .
as using the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the pollution caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .

there are limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in the youth of 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of melting tablet will be removed without dam@@ aging them .
efficacy and efficacy of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have been previously un@@ proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup and the placebo group was immediately and wich did not significantly increase from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at to obtain a stimul@@ ating form of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied more than 14 days , there was no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically significant
in one single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow rates including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks that are connected to flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ lized phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients ( 6 % ) , and under Black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of this patient was not devi@@ ating from the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were organic .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , however , in conjunction with the dose of dose studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take any inher@@ ent problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
the incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group as in the placebo group .
infants aged 6 to 23 months were the most common adverse events that were reported to be more common than placebo reported , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , 2.5 @-@ mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution were observed in patients with a one @-@ time dose of patients at the age of 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma @-@ centre of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may also be depending on the duration of symptoms or even in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
as using the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduces the amount caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .

in June 2008 , Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) , that the Company re@@ ass@@ umes his application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N1 flu in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu , caused by the strain of influ@@ enza A virus ( Type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine which might cause a strain of influ@@ enza virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the influ@@ enza virus appears that humans can easily spread from human beings , because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form this case in contact with an influ@@ enza virus of this case .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body alien ) , has been att@@ ained and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection from some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this resulted in the scope of clinical data base for assess@@ ing the safety of the vaccine , in order to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s treat@@ ise .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be prescribed , if the doctor has examined , which has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al drug to the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has judged the virus to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , damage to the immune system and therefore delays the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , however without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased pharmac@@ euticals for 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
basic indic@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the changes of viral load after treatment .
in the trials with patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children A@@ gener@@ ase likewise reduced the viral load , however , of the children who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , were only very few for the treatment .
in the study of adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , this was equally effective with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in the patient with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r a more powerful decrease of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who had their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood pil@@ es ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who are car@@ eg@@ ed ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are exploited just like A@@ gener@@ ase and harmful in high concentrations in the blood health precaution .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are taking the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( symptoms of infection ) or an immune re@@ activation ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase have taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ ox@@ et@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance samples and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ox@@ et@@ r as a solution to intake is less than 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and a solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ ox@@ et@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ for@@ cing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ ox@@ et@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adults should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain reduced plasma cent@@ ages and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r as in@@ gest@@ ion of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection , and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treating A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk of transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver interaction with potentially le@@ thal history .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the related subject of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show a increased frequency of liver function among anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluid or other Glu@@ col@@ oc@@ or@@ if@@ ids , which are confused about CY@@ P3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the re@@ plac@@ ment of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medications , which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma particles ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ ox@@ ho@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ation@@ sy@@ symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also given .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ itis of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this is contra@@ indicated by children under an age of four years and should be used with caution at certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be put on duration 5 if a rash or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , or an ex@@ er@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other illnesses , their therapy drugs needed , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B . higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts factors such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) that have been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ viral or resi@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections can develop at asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to heavy clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ is reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase can not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma glucose with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ sands , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the decreased plasma stem through a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be dri@@ fted by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ enor@@ av@@ ir@@ spiegel are , and , if possible to check the viral load and depos@@ e the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ co@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ven@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ox@@ o capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and confidenti@@ ality of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % dri@@ p when amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r ( 750 m@@ g. twice a day ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of ampl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended that it is not known to its effectiveness and un@@ certainty of this combination .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended because of ant@@ acids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase will lie at least one hour ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose is required .
the treatment with ampl@@ itudes in combination with ampl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be decreased .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in possibly reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able , since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the lower or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ mac@@ ab@@ ut@@ in ( AU@@ C ) by R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase in order to reduce the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma screens of both medicines might be increased in the case of simultaneous appoint@@ ments .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of de@@ ve@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on 2.@@ 69@@ times a day , which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day , which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day , without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gener@@ ase might lead to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ ox@@ ho@@ r , can result in a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plasma cl@@ ots of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ spar@@ az@@ em , di@@ lu@@ pine , nic@@ odi@@ pine , pine @-@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma cent@@ ages and intensi@@ fy using P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ col@@ oc@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treating a risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose re@@ jects vary greatly from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , depend on the plasma glucose levels in the current administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma stress increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or which can lead to my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ ox@@ et@@ r .
a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stab@@ i@@ lization of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma @-@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of am@@ ox@@ et@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in this case , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be used with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while respec@@ ting A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase of plasma samples from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ation@@ sy@@ symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also given .
due to the per se low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir@@ - dosage is to be administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ z@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predictable , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ lin ) is recommended in the current gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used by careful removal of possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of l@@ ami@@ er rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves people in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by am@@ ni@@ ory in the u@@ terus until the end of the nursing time Am@@ der@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase of the 12 body weight during post@@ ing .
the further development of the ann@@ ot@@ ation , including fer@@ til@@ ation and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ hood .
the in@@ def@@ ici@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up@@ lifting , compet@@ ed early and rarely led to treatment .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients were not treated 1,200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were scored by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medi@@ ums and performed in more than 1 % of patients , than in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast @-@ fat tissues , increasing intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hic liver and dor@@ as cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( p@@ amp@@ ons ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral are un@@ treated subjects who had been treated with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a medium length of 36 weeks , was only a case ( bul@@ locks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is relating to a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash usually were mild to moderately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ atic or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ sive nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without having to canc@@ eled the treatment with am@@ ox@@ y .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease , or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ viral or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who were treated 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ fication Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes were obtained from patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) when necessary , the necessary support measures are necessary .
Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r binds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the proc@@ essi@@ onal viral and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ dent@@ ition levels with the result of an formation un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied at acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell@@ lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of up to HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
during the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors used with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - rarely observed mut@@ ations described .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral do not treated patients who have received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred twice a week , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 locked patients with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 3@@ I , M@@ 3@@ V , I@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 48@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M , L@@ 90@@ M , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on Gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analysis , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a increased phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions on the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always test current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze resistance tests .
on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , Klin@@ isch vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the evaluation of the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cruci@@ resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but is generally preserved .
there are currently data for cruci@@ resist@@ ence between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossil @-@ avi@@ ary resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients ( one of them ) , a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , the In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; ob@@ taining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with the lowest kn@@ ur@@ ned Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with reduced virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average exchange rate ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sau@@ lt shaft of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was given three mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ vic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously administered at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on this data , the treatment of patients with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered as expected benefit of &quot; un@@ conventional &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral dos@@ ing , the average duration of up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ sands is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max . if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was given to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ox@@ et@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
consequently , the minimum concentration of the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food influences the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a dist@@ illed penetration of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of active substances in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ enor@@ rhe@@ a , representing the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ox@@ y remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients in the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state across the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , medications that in@@ duce CY@@ P3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 will be given when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ asis .
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma particles comparable to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ox@@ et@@ r twice a day , without simultaneous appoint@@ ments of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both clinical trials and the therapeutic use , there were little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al test results in human periph@@ eral lympho@@ cy@@ tes contained , was amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical use by the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated from age 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals of the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) when the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage was observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ for@@ cing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ ox@@ et@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should occur in patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medications , which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set up to 27 if a rash or allergic symptoms are accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an elevated risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drugs dependent factors such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ sands , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ ox@@ o capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of ampl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ ox@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended that it is not known to its effectiveness and un@@ certainty of this combination .
the treatment with ampl@@ itudes in combination with ampl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be decreased .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase in order to reduce the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the serum concentration of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ lu@@ pin , di@@ lu@@ pine , lu@@ pine pin , pine @-@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased by amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
in the current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous appoint@@ ments of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 m@@ g. E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ der@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used by careful removal of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by am@@ ni@@ ory in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ u@@ terus at the end of the lac@@ u@@ terus , showed a decreased increase in body weight during post@@ ing .
the in@@ def@@ ici@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) when necessary , the necessary support measures are necessary .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; ob@@ taining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the treatment of patients with PI pre@@ treated children should be considered as expected benefit of &quot; un@@ conventional &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ox@@ y remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients in depen@@ dency of the ag@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state across the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..
therefore , medications that in@@ duce CY@@ P3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 will be given when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using a Knight on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was not treated with PI @-@ treated patients with PI before treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ ox@@ et@@ r as a solution to intake is less than 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and a solution are not inter@@ changeable for a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should swal@@ low as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no need for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to import and low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be avoided this combination with these patient groups .
although a dose of dos@@ ing is not necessary for am@@ ox@@ et@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col@@ itis , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous appoint@@ ments may lead to a competent in@@ hibition of these drugs and possibly produce serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to cure the HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treating A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of reducing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medications , which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ dat@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis was observed and a case involving circumcision &apos;s leading kn@@ itting .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses there is increased risk of heavy local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which require treatment and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which required an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous form@@ alities for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ n in the genital and periph@@ eral sector have no clinical experiences .
limited data suggests an increased rate of inc@@ lin@@ ation reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown lower efficacy in this patient group regarding the removal of the f@@ eig@@ ns .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or the hair of hair was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions take in general during therapy or reactions are following the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream .
if it is needed because of the dis@@ comfort of the patient or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after re@@ generating the skin for about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
since currently no data is available on long @-@ term heal@@ ers of more than 36 months of treatment , other appropriate treatment forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ ant bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
clinical experiences are not recommended in patients with recur@@ rent and treated B@@ CC@@ s . therefore , the application is not recommended already in treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip service .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical points outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore such application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions are normally taken during therapy at intensity or go after removal of the therapy using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin responses are causing big dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions a lower total healing rate referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ant properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be used with caution when patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies , no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ elling development , develop the bond or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither according to one @-@ time top@@ ical application of qu@@ anti@@ fi@@ able serum ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , there may be no recommendation to use during the breast@@ feeding .
most commonly @-@ shared and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to studies in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the treatment of f@@ eig@@ ns ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
most commonly reported and considered possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side @-@ side effects include complaints with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , known as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to these studies were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the side effects reported by 252 in placebo controlled clinical trials of Phase III with i@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below .
according to the test plan evalu@@ ating clinical signs indicated that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) , Ex@@ plan@@ ation / drainage ( 23 % ) and oil ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan evalu@@ ating clinical signs , it shows that in these studies of five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream very frequently came to heavy consider@@ ations ( 31 % ) , serious ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ hydr@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the study of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s treatment for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment agency or in the surrounding field .
the acci@@ dental continuous recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically he@@ avi@@ est side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study demonstrated according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines .
in 3 appro@@ vals , phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a full healing of the f@@ eig@@ n treatment with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy is superior to placebo over 16 weeks .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated the no@@ od@@ ors completely ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) .
a complete release could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time use per week more than 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically , single primary super @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long term study after four years now show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically treated and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treated free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ics ac@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment are@@ als on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the annual data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show patients with clinical separation after one or two treatment periods of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external sources , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma normally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the measured dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks .
serum concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived between 9 and 12 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated value of se@@ mit@@ es was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour@@ ly hal@@ f@@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low and comparable to MC ill skin of patients at age 6 @-@ 12 and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ son@@ ic bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG was significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also performed four months in the same study compared with the mouse there was no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induc@@ ted at the application site for three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic is a risk for human exposure as a very low view .
the tum@@ ors were in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cr@@ ème , so@@ oner and in larger numbers than in the control group with minor U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with a diagnosis of a sample with a sample in a sample of a sample of the disease ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and dam@@ aging them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , st@@ iff joints , the movements difficult , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients need to prevent the medicine in order to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( in terms of reducing genetic concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions on the in@@ fusion outlet .
very common side effects of patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used to treat patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update all new information , which may be known , verify and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the approval of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using a re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ tier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a sample in a sample of ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried through a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial inc@@ iner@@ ation rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient we@@ ars this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any other side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of In@@ fusion ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be supervised , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emergen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients were Ig@@ G antibody against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment start .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with care of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery after a longer break , due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction , it must be c@@ auti@@ ous after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related response the treatment of anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related response , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are dec@@ lining , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resumed after a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
because no data is exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns which exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the breast milk , it is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical studies were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 45 patients at age 5 or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table after the following frequencies : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs , there were also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at age 5 , with a greater severe over@@ flow form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are reported in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once per week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once per week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients the treatment occurred within 3 months after the beginning of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with the patients at age 5 years of age ( average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until an early withdrawal from the study ) were not present in 13 / 45 patients suffering from radio immune cip@@ ital ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies , including 3 patients with which it never occurred to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing up to low anti@@ bodies referred to a robust reduction in G@@ ag SL@@ R in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ bodies a variable reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n was fixed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing repair effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ ag im Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies didn &apos;t seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing a further accumulation of an accumulation of enzymes .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly disper@@ sed from the cycle and cells in Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely to use Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo controlled phase 3 study at age 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients had been identified by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute en@@ cl@@ ings in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to improve lung function and capacity to be shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects could be up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as from the table below .
in contrast , the decline in the compared compar@@ ative percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ eg@@ aly treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear@@ er waste of the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant by the study .
in terms of hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease mod@@ ulation of patients suffering from a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , motion area of the ep@@ aul@@ dron Ah@@ i and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally used in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients , which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy over@@ flow form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n per week 22 in the past 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a mag@@ n@@ itude growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined by the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mid @-@ run form had a normal mental development speed , whereas only limited or no progress in the cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various alt@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once per week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once per week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can result in patients who have difficulty with weekly inser@@ ts ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be all new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security , tox@@ icity in one @-@ mal@@ icious gift , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data allow no particular dangers to identify people .
as no impair@@ ment studies were carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those under the 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) , which is still no chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) has already spread to other parts of the body . it is probably easy to spread to other parts of the body . it is an advanced or metastatic cell lung cancer which does not attack the epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who previously have not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously already had other chemotherapy than ever used .
to reduce side effects , patients should use cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and obtain injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given to C@@ is@@ plat@@ in before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , reduced or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes lighter in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer run time in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was studied for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously no chemotherapy against their disease .
in treating non @-@ single lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survi@@ vor of A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at 7.9 months .
in both studies , patients suffering from cancer patients were unable to attack the epithel@@ ium cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the traffic of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each spray bottle must be t@@ opped with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the through@@ beam and is diluted to 100 m@@ l. of sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally @-@ advanced or metastatic single @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono@@ xide is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed gift as well as the day after treatment an cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given .
during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid have to be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed dose as well as after each third operating cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should be created before every gift a complete blood@@ shot , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ book .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should amount to 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose check has to take place under the per@@ si@@ res of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the fore@@ se@@ ated therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherap@@ or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ologic tox@@ icity 3 degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must increase the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduction a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .

in clinical studies , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min are not necessary to get rid of the dos@@ is@@ ations recommended for all patients .
the treatment in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( when the presence of liver metast@@ asis ) were not studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone @-@ market supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be given to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thickness of the ratio of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ th and maximum non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity as they were observed in the preceding therapy cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .

all patients need to be instructed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ y- lac@@ tic action to reduce un@@ conditional tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oid antibody ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as iri@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are scheduled for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed will need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long se@@ mit@@ one time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients suffering from these events , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in the trans@@ cellular area a drainage of the result should be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed Treatment .
5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ tives ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of dec@@ ei@@ ving the re@@ productive re@@ productive ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn must be pointed out , coun@@ sel@@ ing in relation to the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ization .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing types 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ oxid@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with a result of increased risk of side effects .
therefore caution is required when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es- 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data has been presented with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long sem@@ esters time as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of stra@@ ining status throughout the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful removal of the utility for the mother and risk factor for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage is caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment of the treatment , to fet@@ ch advice about the sper@@ mac@@ ular .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , o@@ gre@@ asy nutrition .
patients who take up all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should turn to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they cannot build some fats in the food , causing roughly one quarter of the fats associated with the food int@@ akes its intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two trials of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the all@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg , compared with 2.3 kg when taking a placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for the patient .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are di@@ zzy spots on the anus , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ ds ) with chair access , chair , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily sect ( threads ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ po@@ in ( to prevent organs in tran@@ spl@@ ants ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which do not have enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
July 2007 the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group to launch its approval by the company G@@ lax@@ seed GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , o@@ ily fet@@ al nutrition .
all@@ i may not be used by children and young@@ sters under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , it is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ sy ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chronic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ ant treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a rich single meal or o@@ ily diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes may take effect with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the start of a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic may need to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol level should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional swelling steps in order to prevent the possible contra@@ ctions in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ is was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K remained as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the norm range .
however , patients should be recommended to include a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ oba prior to bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitality ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the treatment of one @-@ one dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , at the same time , or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation .
in experimental studies , no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with the or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the incidence of knowing side effects , which were noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size .
† . it is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can result in relation to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects , without any significant clinical findings occur .
in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dos@@ ing , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations on humans and animal can be assumed by a quick recovery of any system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to li@@ pas@@ em@@ ming properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is set in the l@@ umen of the gast@@ ric acid and the upper small intest@@ ine to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and Pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ch is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled study of adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , o@@ ily fet@@ al nutrition .
the primary parameter , the alter@@ ation of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change from the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of the study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction has been observed in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist range the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ lized or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , the therapeutic or@@ list@@ ings could not only be spor@@ adic at plasma and in very low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and can be detected without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ pose patients , the minimum system@@ ic res@@ or@@ ated dose could be administered , namely two major met@@ abo@@ ons , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after the breakdown of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine Group ) , which set nearly 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , c@@ ann@@ ogenic potential and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can be no particular risk to humans .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy with severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , and for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the intermediate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
application in patients under the age of 18 will not be recommended because the effects in this age range does not have enough information .
this means that the active ingredient is preventing a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy with strong or intermediate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients showed no vom@@ iting with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared 57 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in case of chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi have no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
for a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ power@@ ment chemotherapy for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ power@@ ing chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strong em@@ power@@ ment chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one before chemotherapy @-@ given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on case , patients with am@@ nesty observ@@ ations or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able to extend Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is prolonged or that tend to an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy alone , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy alone for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron not in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ ber@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , elec@@ trop@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , cot@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , quin@@ oa , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies not lie in case of human pregn@@ ancies , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the doctor .
clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly stood with alo@@ xi in the context ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions by appointment ( burning , curing , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of car@@ ot@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given in day 1 without the exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ power@@ ment chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given in day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously .
results of studies with oc@@ e@@ ve@@ al chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ power@@ ing chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the f@@ ec@@ onds pre @-@ clinical trials Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the capability to block the iter@@ ations of the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation process and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows a slow elim@@ ination from the plasma centre a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ale time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma level ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in total dose range from 0,@@ 3- 90 ° g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean age between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma stage at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ time of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
about 40 % of the kidneys are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies on met@@ abolic have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose could be found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ting projection , the whole body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ expect@@ us and the average system@@ ic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , reducing the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate for the maximum treatment of human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 The clinical trials showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a greater frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , tri@@ but@@ ary mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the high doses and because Alo@@ xi is determined for unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be evaluated .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use of Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expert assessment regarding the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alph@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practic@@ able ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ dic ) hepatitis C ( one caused by a viral infection ) .
a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination shows the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the nutri@@ ent .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( nutri@@ ent structure , composition and purity of the drug , effici@@ encies , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of reference case to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients were evaluated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document , Author@@ ised for Non Business Technology only , the EMEA is : what were the greatest concerns regarding the CH@@ MP recommended to fail approval ?
furthermore , concerns were warned that data will not suff@@ ice to stability of the nutri@@ ent and market drugs .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , related to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjustment of the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was again ret@@ arded with more patients than with the reference case ; too , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , in the study , the test was conducted in the study , in what is the drug an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a related skin infection ) and small in@@ fest@@ ed in@@ gest@@ ion ( cra@@ cks or sec@@ utes ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and inc@@ lined wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections that have been prov@@ oked or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ osis Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go might not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years old may not be more than 2 % of the body surface to be treated .
if the patient does not address two to three days after treatment , the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was removed after the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients were conducted under placebo .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of both groups were involved in the treatment of both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been detected in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ary ( eit@@ ful cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or by infection that have been prov@@ oked or presumably by MR@@ SA are not effective enough .
the most common side effect with al@@ clo@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contract .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial al infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , de@@ preci@@ ation or wires .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . to appro@@ ve the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
patients who show no improvements within two or three days , should be investigated once again and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensiti@@ zation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully sc@@ anned and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients suffering from a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma cent@@ work that has been reached upon people after top@@ ical use on the poor skin or infected with superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo work is not expected in vivo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the time of oral treatment of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ producing x@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ sufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ biotic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , it is weak@@ ened between the benefits of the nursing inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect on the final destination was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of mode ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ an@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin mechanism is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding place of the 50s sub unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the binding place of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ier@@ ant anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bond @-@ centre of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding station and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred centre .
through li@@ aison to this bond site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line gives the pep@@ ti@@ dal transfer , block partial P @-@ binding stell@@ ations and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ bos@@ omes units .
should the use of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin may appear in at least some infections , should advise an advice through experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ul@@ ators were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ speaking to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us treatment the presence of trun@@ ks with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was released daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on sc@@ anned skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary medical wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sample took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of poor skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP Hem@@ lock .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver microphones was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro ver@@ ification on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test and in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lympho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ core test chromos@@ om@@ al effects of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has reached up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest possible exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 with s@@ wollen skin ) :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats were detected in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development of development ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and material tox@@ icity .

ambient temperature is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix will be used within two doses of existing vacc@@ inations , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine will be led out of two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient temperature or other hepatitis C or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by adding the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it .
ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine of Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vacc@@ ination Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix Children are given existing vacc@@ inations in the frame of a three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are present identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective anti @-@ cell concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient temperature in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children spent a month after the last injection of the development of anti@@ bodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the ambient temperature at Ambi@@ rix was at a six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ t@@ iness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be sensitive to patients who may react to drugs , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) cannot be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ra@@ s.@@ a to appro@@ ve the ambient temperature of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster vacc@@ ination is requested for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ bodies are in the same order as following the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ ological competent individuals who have addressed a collection of hepatitis re@@ vacc@@ ination , as they may have no more demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies to be protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tion@@ compounds the rare cases of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic response should be available immediately according to the treatment of the vaccine , according to the treatment of the vaccine , according to the treatment of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand@@ ar@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ination which contains 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with distur@@ ban@@ ishment of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved , so in these cases , the gift of other vacc@@ ination can be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal vaccine result , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ ani can be inj@@ ected equally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of separate injection , tet@@ anic and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza , type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps vaccine was administered , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ def@@ ensive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , that may have no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study that has been crossed with 3 vacc@@ ination of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ u@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ic and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ination form@@ ulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the ambi@@ ence of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ernity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ um Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9,1 % of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had to get given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ory was relatively high ( i.e. above the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects received at Ambi@@ ani , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % for the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses of combinations . )
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ t@@ ness was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ination with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which , with the 3 @-@ doses of combined hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
however , with the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more common occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , is not reported per pro @-@ band .
the proportion of imports , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses at Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses terminal with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B , was statist@@ ically significant .
in clinical trials that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at age 1 to and including 15 years , were the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses at Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combined with three doses .
with the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was worth@@ less , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than at Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 in the case of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. 7 month 7 ) , are listed in the table below .
in both studies , imports are either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ in@@ ema with a combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of the Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies have been detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to the vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies are comparable to 0 @-@ 6 months .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ ded with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ anic and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current form@@ ulation in adults showed similar form@@ ulation and power conversion rates as for previous form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is to examine both foreign particles and / or physical visible changes in the case as well as after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .

the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ us@@ hal@@ ved foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other paths , such as swimming in water contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( though you / your child may feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel free ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections , which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis C or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an anti@@ biotic ) .
an allergic reaction may have occurred due to it@@ ching skin rash , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . if you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conven@@ ing of the second vaccine dose ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis @-@ A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective stock levels ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formal infected hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a real hepatitis B surface coating ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective stock is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination to termin@@ ate the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people who suffer heavy bleeding problems , under the skin and not in the muscle inj@@ ected . • If you are weak / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ ent can be given in these cases , but the immune response can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Say to your doctor if you / your child may take another medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated with no prescri@@ ption ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or bought in immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficiently large and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at Ambi@@ rix at the same time , should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and as possible limbs .
if ambient temperature is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ ent &apos;s pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) once with you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 c@@ ann@@ ular doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ ting site or redness • mat@@ ernity • ache • App@@ et@@ ite deficiency
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 c@@ ann@@ ular doses ) : • Sw@@ ung at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Fe@@ eding • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 sc@@ anned doses ) are :

based on the data that has been known since the issu@@ ance of the initial licence for transport , CH@@ MP re@@ signed the opinion that the uti@@ lizing risk factor for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ani was brought to traffic only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete en@@ cephal@@ opathy or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is divided - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed by food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nas@@ al burner ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ us should not be compared with other treatment or placebo ( a placebo medicine , i.e. without an active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of inf@@ ancy in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , pain relief , pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , rash , rash or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use Case ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium is effectively prevented from patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle .
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the condition of the disease , only limited information about this medicine was given .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel already manifest@@ ed in the newborn ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( infected en@@ cephal@@ ic , which is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ trop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by the protein toler@@ ance and the patient &apos;s needed daily intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ boo phosph@@ ate , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ ase deficiency need to get arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ low disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and Ö@@ de@@ mb@@ ild@@ ung in advanced clinical conditions only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ on multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed maturity of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS has contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) occurred at least 78 % of these adverse events that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with Lak@@ a@@ emia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms can with an accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active link , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ ylene with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of urine cycle can be accepted , that for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborn was almost always inf@@ alli@@ zed , and the disease even resulted in treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their in@@ fle@@ ction @-@ free analog@@ ous in the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated ch@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate from post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and had already been treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % but even in these patients suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ine scar@@ ring form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency , which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients , a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys of glut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metast@@ ases in plasma and urine samples were obtained in a dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in n@@ ul@@ ary healthy adults and in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of urine , and repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cent@@ ages of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were established .
in the majority of patients suffering from urea @-@ cyc@@ lical or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opathy was present after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) at the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma at the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the plasma mas@@ ons were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no less toxic effects ( study 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing from 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also or a nas@@ al onde .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ boo phosph@@ ate , or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat orders were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with Lak@@ a@@ emia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of urine @-@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients may cause further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cent@@ ages of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were established .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this procedure , the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to get the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
patients with these rare diseases are absent certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may skip the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion and head@@ aches , head@@ aches , im@@ balances , del@@ im@@ ity , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , start immediately with your doctor or with the emergency photo of your hospital for purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the in@@ gest@@ ion of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ography is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction .
if angi@@ ox@@ ification is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients suffering from a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and raise the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox occurs with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug concerning the prevention of blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
while the PCI was frequently used to patients ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks , or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox@@ in was equally effective in terms of indicators such as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any other component .
furthermore , it may not be used in patients that recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ography is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to launch an author@@ ization of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do ) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ography in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another episode , additional bol@@ us should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and increase in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one itself immediately subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT , after 5 minutes ) has been shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of only 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be used carefully before applying .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients suffering from severe kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inc@@ iner@@ ation rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us in an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ogen@@ icity ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ ed hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of lower molecular hep@@ arin .
• 2 known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ atic and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly bacterial endo@@ cr@@ dit@@ is . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI patients appear under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in most of the arter@@ ial points of arter@@ ial points , in patients suffering from a sub@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , in principle it may occur everywhere in the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and are treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ ally ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after placing the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is once again completed before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) , these substances can increase the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ genic aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis is to control regularly in any case .

the following data on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups were treated with women and patients over 65 years old and more frequently in adverse events than male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are listed according to systems organ@@ classes listed in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately inter@@ rupt and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in inhibit@@ or , which binds both at the cat@@ aly@@ st centre as well as at the A@@ ni@@ on@@ en@@ eck region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn slowly up the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .

if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional value of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ scale in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected or inj@@ ected with the upper arm or an in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regul@@ ate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or does not process insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins differs very slightly from human@@ oid , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter duration than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra became in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes in which the body insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % compared to insulin is found .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in case of human normal problems .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion to the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose load capacity and the reduced insulin release , the insulin requires a limitation of liver function in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of activity levels , the trademark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can take a change in the insulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or the termination of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ atory diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic car@@ ve@@ azi@@ one ; these conditions are potentially li@@ men@@ ac@@ ing .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin produced in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances which increase blood sugar levels and increase inc@@ lin@@ ation to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of rep@@ u@@ rep@@ u@@ rep@@ u@@ ation will be weak@@ ened or missing .
experimental studies on refra@@ c@@ tory tests did not show any differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid related to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ ism occurs in the human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor will it res@@ orted to oral use .
following are the clinical trials listed in clinical studies , groups are listed according to system organic classes and arranged according to decre@@ asing the frequency of their rising ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des with imp@@ el@@ ess@@ ness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of glucose by a physician .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous hydr@@ o @-@ be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the effect duration shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ly normal .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin produced in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg amounts to a dose of proportional glucose effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose effect , just like human@@ oid .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human@@ oid and achieves the complete glucose effect about 2 hours earlier than humanity .
from the data there was obvious that during an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as is given up to 30 minutes before meal .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was taken , was achieved a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than given to the meal that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
in 15 minutes , insulin delivery will be turned into at least 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as in case of human normal , which is 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal was given as compared to human normal insulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) before a meal ( figure 1 B ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin delivery in the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - Mal@@ es , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1C ) .
