<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report (EPAR), in which is explained how the Committee for Human Use Case (CHMP) has assessed the study carried out regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or their treatment, please read the packets (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Zip thinking and speech, hallucinations (listening or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and deluities; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal strongholds) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat severe and heavier manic episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of eivable unrest or behavioral problems, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for intake or melting tablet in patients may be used to make the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazol probably works primarily as" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazole as 5-hydroxytramine and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter seems to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol carries to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-appearance is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, has been examined in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">In two studies, the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo who have been stabilized in 160 patients with whom the manic symptoms had been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injectionation solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which are caused by irritant unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablet and the solution to absorb (decreasing).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution patients, the Abilify patients showed in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms caused by unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder treatment, Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo perceived manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also been more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapolaridale, headache, blurred vision, dyspepsy (dizziness), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting and exhaustion, insomnia, insomnia (insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use Case (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in treating bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode of patients who had mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased imitation and behavioral problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance when oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate-heavy episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased efficacy in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as a monoor combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">ABILIFY's efficacy in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, lower initials should be considered in consideration if clinical factors justifies this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripipelzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases following an antipsychotic therapy, even in treating Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution when patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony predispose (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less permanent, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia in treatment during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late-dysentinae should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient sign signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be set off.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with crutants in the Anamnese or in conditions associated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazol in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the connection for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazitin or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphenia, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripipelzol on the central nervous system caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlay side effects as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 Antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripigezol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolzing, the common application can result from CYP3A4 in higher plasma centages from Aripipelzol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensizing.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like Itraconazole and HIV proteases, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After abetting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be upgraded to the dose prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be regarded as a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripipelzol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-Methodixymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if you are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data position for safety when human being caused by the animal's concerns, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles to use until they are safe, that Aripiprazole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects come more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis were treated compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in cases under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients were treated with Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripigezol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripigezol and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters came, there was no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in Cpk (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, speldyskinesis, and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefit since Aripiprazol has a high plasma rotates.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripigezol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance about the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine d2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-reputergen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the Positches-Emission Tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the ties of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of the responded to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assau- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than on Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzine-controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia above 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly less patients with weight gain of at least 7% compared to the starting value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca. 6%).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monoxide studies with a flexible dosage for 3 weeks with manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed superior effectiveness in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo controlled monoxide study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monootherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect, comparable to which of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also proved a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on how to lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo controlled study of more than 6 weeks with manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol found a superior effectiveness in reduction of manic symptoms compared to the monotherapies with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of more than 74 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks, Aripiprazol showed a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar back, predominantly in prevention of a back in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxying of Aripipelzol, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time of life is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on the CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolzing over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, and also showed no gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic study.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of the pharmacokinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study involving subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety checks, toxicity in repeated treatment, reproduction, genotoxicity and the canogeneous potential, pre-clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicidal significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a dosing-pertinent acrine (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal-state exposure (AUC) at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholesterol-based hydroxycycasis was determined by Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys to repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average maximum dose of people based on humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations were found in the human Galle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far under the threshold values (6%) of the concentrations in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects after dosages, which lead to expositions of 3- and 11x of the middle Steady State AUC, at the recommended clinical maximum dose, observed.</seg>

<seg id="149">In addition to a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to Aripipelzol injection solution, patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Examinations on safety and effectiveness of Aripigezol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by spelling or illegal pharmaceuticals).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution when patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony predispose (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late) Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less permanent, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>

<seg id="155">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, which gain weight gain as side effect and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was larger compared to the sole treatment of Aripiprazol, in a study in the healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) as a one-time intramusculaire (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripigezol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolites can result in comparison to CYP2D6 extensizing the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma centre of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteases, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After abetting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be upgraded to the dose prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, was the intensity of segregation larger compared to the sole treatment of Aripiprazol.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 The following side effects come more frequently on (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*) as possible clinical studies (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripigezol and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters came, there was no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in Cpk (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Among the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, speldyskinesis, and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with bipolar disorder as well as agitation and behavioral problems, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement of the starting value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agitivity, a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of the total population, but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient figure.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="176">In one Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of the responded to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than on Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a Olanzine-controlled, multinationals double-blind study involving schizophrenia above 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and in the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly less patients suffering from at least 7% compared to the starting value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca. 6%).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of patients with manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol found a superior effectiveness in reduction of manic symptoms compared to the monotherapies with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study expansion in some cases, Aripiprazol showed a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar back, predominantly in prevention of a back in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is in the first 2 hours following intramuscular injection of 90% larger the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects the average time to reach the maximum plasma membrane is 1-3 hours after application.</seg>

<seg id="185">In studies on the reproduction of the intravenous application, no safety-related concerns were obtained after maternity exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) for the maximum therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for the security of safety, toxicity in repeated treatment, reproduction, genotoxicity and the canogeneous potential, the pre-clinical data have no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicidal significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects embraced a dosing-peroid of adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchykidney disease) in rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle tiady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholesterol-based hydroxycycasis was determined by Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys to repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average maximum dose on humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole treatment or as a monotherapy) was compared with the conventional packing (given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane treated patients to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients, conventional packing and conventional treatment.</seg>

<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously had previously treated other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional Paclitaxel containing medicines.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have silent or before the beginning of the treatment of low neutrophiles in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee on Human Use Case (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was no longer effective in patients with which the first treatment has not been given more effective than conventional Paclitaxel containing drugs containing other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis Bioscience Limited granted an approval for the transport of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not displayed (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity is based on a definitiable case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules agent which promotes the confiscation of the microtubules from the tubular indigenes and stabilized the microtubules by blocking their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">Stabilisation leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cellular functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the Transcytosis of plasma welding into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies the presence of Albumin conveys the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transportation is mediated by the gp-60-Albuminreceptor and due to the Albanian protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurring in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two ardy-blind studies and of 454 patients that were treated in a randomized Phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients treated with metastatic breast cancer with a cuxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for bottoms on baseline due to cumulative toxicity of cuxane by &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 has been determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel-Plasmaconcentration was increased in a multiphasing way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium volume of the distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive extravascular distribution and / or turnout connection of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel have been compared to intravenous 30-minute Infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gift (43%) than after a solvent-containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was cuxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microphones and tissue coating is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized - hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 cuxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the average total of 4% of the given total dose amounted to less than 1% of the metabolism 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="363">Injection can also be made by the patient or his advisor status, provided that they have received an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic kidney disease or patients who receive chemotherapy should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>

<seg id="369">Abseamed was administered by appointment as an injection in a Vene in the framework of a major study involving 479 patients who caused anemia caused by genetic problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were converted to Abseamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study, in which the effects of under the skin sprayed Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients, which were converted to Abseamed, were treated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, collateral migrating and confusion.</seg>

<seg id="385">Hemoglobin-target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for diabetic patients who should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms vary depending on the age, gender and total disease majority; therefore evaluating the individual clinical course and disease condition are required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemogloin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed during one patient or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be carried out by 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value is more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin wert is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the oxetine alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epicetine alfa is in the lowest allowed dose which is necessary for the control of anemia and angiomysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="395">Treatment symptoms vary depending on the age, gender and total disease last; therefore evaluating the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be carried out by 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored meshed to ensure that epicetine alfa is in the lowest allowed dose which is needed for the control of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the reagent number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be kept from 150 to E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and Retikulozygons &lt; 0.062 mmol / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 treatment weeks of 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of hemoglobin / dl (≥ 0.062 mmol / l) or the reagent number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl has increased, the dose should be kept from 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">However, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and Retikulozygums increased by &lt; 0.062 mmol / µl compared to the baseline value, a response to the epicetine alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), which is required for the predisposition of ≥ 4 blood conservatives, Abseamed should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">With iron substitution, as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donate program - started at the beginning of the Abseamed therapy large iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epicetine alfa, which should be given weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgical procedure and the day of the intervention (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Here, epicetine alfa was preoperative 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention, as well as 4 days directly after that.</seg>

<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic kidney disease, it should not be exceeded, under Section 4.2, the threshold limit of the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">Clinical trials have observed increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events, when erythropoese stimulating agents (ESA) were given by a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epoxetine symptoms, when hemoglobination is increased for the control of odeficiency symptoms and preventing blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney disease and clinical evidence, coronarer coronary or dust insufficiency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 the threshold of the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the current knowledge, the treatment of anemia with epicetine alfa in adults with kidney insufficiency, which are not yet dialysed, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">For cancer patients with chemotherapy should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epicetine alfa a 2-3-week delay between epicetine alfa drugs and the erythropoetin response (patients that possibly need to be transfunnier).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk of potential thrombal events (see section 4.2 of patients with chemotherapieal anemia - dosing with the aim of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for use recombinant Erythropoetine should be based on a utilisation risk reduction in particular patients who should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger medical orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the beginning of the epicetine alfa drugs, the cause of anemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients suffering from a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, should have an appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoxetine alfa for patients with an initial volume of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can persist.</seg>

<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin patients with anemia due to various frequent malignites consistent, statistically significantly higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications with recombinant human erythropoetin patients and with controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumor patients who are treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is applied in patients with a high risk of fracturing (bone bursts), including patients who have recently suffered a traumatic rushing defeat as in the case; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fractures should have a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means against inflammation) in the three days after infusion are occurring symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">To treat the Morbus Paget, Aclasta must only be prescribed by doctors, who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material was attracted to the rating of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8 000 older women were involved with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures were examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study involved 2 127 male and women with osteoporosis for 50 years, which had recently suffered a joint fracture; the number of fractures were examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months with risedronat (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">Basic indikator for efficacy was whether the concentration of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme which abuses bone structure) in the blood again, or by at least 75% over the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women the risk of editary cultures was reduced in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70%.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison of all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis), the risk of fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fractures 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most adverse events of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against zoledroneic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion outlet and osteonecrose (dying from bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides clarification material for physicians to prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients, in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney disease (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as there are only limited clinical experience for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypokalemia is before the beginning of the treatment with asclasta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledroneic acid on bone structure, a temporary hypocritical hypokalemia can be developed, which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all time units compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase of the BMD by 5.4% in the overall rushes and 4.3% at the string.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study were randomised 508 men, and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fracture in men; the frequency of clinical fracture was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study with men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was used as opposed to the once weekly gift of Alendronat related to the percentage change in the lenbel BMD after 24 months compared to the starting value.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and), with the above mentioned ½ -values) represent probably the rapid resorption in bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearing amounts regardless of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmaconcentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of mettochrome P450-Enzymatic compounds is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized when humans are not metabolized - because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, nutrient-dependent inhibitors of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the atinine Clearance, and amounted to 64 patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive kidney disease until a creatinine-clearing up to 35 mL / min does not require any dosing of zoledron acid.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Notification Report (EPAR), which is explained by the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (in particular overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (DualTherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylharnide or insulin delivery, the present dose of the sulfa drugs may be retained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of the sulphate substance or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be utilized better, and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acetate in triple therapy has been studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycolic hemoglobin, HbA1c) that shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value that leaves the blood sugar levels to be reduced by 15 mg, 30mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy trial the effect of an additional administration of acetin and a sulfa drugs result in a lowering of the HbA1c value by 0,94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had been examined in 289 patients, the Actos increased in addition to insulin delivery of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (common colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may neither be used in patients who may react to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic veto (acid level - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos can serve as part of a monotherapist (with sole use) as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to launch Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted and inappropriate for those metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or Ödeme, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and Ödeme when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of age 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing more advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver cells (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT-mirrors are increased to the 3-fold threshold of the standard range, the Liver Enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develop symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver levels.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory's laboratory parameters should be conducted by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dosing-dependent weight gain has been detected, which may be absorbed by fat cells and in some cases linked to a liquid projection.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemmodifier, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemostasis by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfa drugs or as a two-way combination therapy with insulin-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the launch of the market with thiazolidindia, Pioglitazone, including Pioglitazone, was reported by a reduction or deterioration of a diabetic macular hole.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of Makulaödemen, however, the possibility of a Makulaödems should be aware of the possibility of investigating the visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractions per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for analysis of cardiovascular events, competencies in patients were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter this one, the treatment is decreasing (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone had no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-reductist are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the fibrous (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the extent that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsanemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother is diminished and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents stepped across the three times the upper limit of the norm range, but less rarely than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnener.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcomes research in patients with pre-existing more advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of a severe heart failure at Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzv.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely over heart failure was reported under Pioglitazon, however, if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted an overall analysis of messages of adverse events in randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the study period of 3.5 years of running PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to act on an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Receptor-γ (PPAR-g)) which leads to an increased insulin-sensitive of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosystem in case of a insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazone versus Gliclacidal as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the end of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaocide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately adjusted according to insulin had been randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0,45% compared to patients who continue to get insulin; a reduction in the insulin treatment in the group treated with Pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decline of the albumin / creatinine quota compared to output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week test analysis of type 2 diabetikern.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmas and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol was observed, while under metformin and gliclaicidal values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazone reduced not only the vigorous triglycerides but also improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcomes, had been randomized 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing more advanced macrovascular disease in groups to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, where the peak concentrations were obtained via unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazan had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the macular hole of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral use of radioactive material Pioglitazone in man, the marker was found mainly in the threads (55%) and a lower degree in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmaconcentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy patients with reduced kidney function, but the rates of orals of the oral substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies have occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after the repeated plasma volume enlarging with hematesta, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the extent that under treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperinsanemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother is diminished and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a model of familial polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindia led to an increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractions per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for analysis of cardiovascular events, competencies in patients were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine quota compared to output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the vigorous triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Trygnostic d synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the aim of its primary endpoint, a combination of overall mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronarisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, lay out the results close that the intake of Pioglitazone are not linked to cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 7,100 patients were treated with Pioglitazone, the comparative incidence of bones was demonstrated by women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for analysis of cardiovascular events, competencies in patients were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the vigorous triglycerides but also improved the triglyceride level, this has a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycolic hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels have been reduced similar to other humanity.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) to humanity (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of acetphane could possibly be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to remove the packages.)</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acetphane in the treatment of diabetes regarding the risks concealed.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted an approval to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for deployment of Actraphane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a fast initiale effect is requested with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection needle must leave at least 6 seconds under the skin for a minimum of 6 seconds to ensure the whole dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar should be significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia hazard symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (rapid acting, biphytic, long-effective insulin) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin of animal origin) may result in a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the changes to Actraphane is required when using a dose of dosing, this can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients showed hypoglycemic reactions after a change from human insulin to human insulin, that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travel, going through several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to catch the advice of his doctor, as such journeys could lead to insulin and meals to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interaction in therapy and ask his patients to other drugs taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 And both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diet therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglyceriums may lead to mallessness and / or cramp failures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Illnesses of the nervous system Gelegally - peripheral neuropathy can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. but intensifying the insulin therapy with a abrupt improvement of blood sugar settings, however, can be associated with temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Illnesses of the skin and underwear tissue growth - Lipodystrophy At the injection site can be created a lipodystrophy when failed to change the inserts within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General diseases and complaints during the final destination gel. local hypersensitivity reaction during the insulin therapy can occur local hypersensitivity actions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Gelegally - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions symptoms generalised hypersensitivity, oating, gastrointestinal disturbances, angioneurial oil, palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid irritation of esophagus, the patient must not stand up until after the first food intake of the day, the earliest after 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to detect the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with ADROVANCE, low (11%) than for those used exclusively Alendronat's income (32%).</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previous studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study of 668 patients with kidney transplantation was submitted, with the application of Advaginal raf introduced with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosa.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients during which the transplant was coordinated after a duration of a year (for example, how often a new organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies have been performed on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined, as Advagraf is absorbed in comparison to prograf / prograft from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunossuppressant therapy and treatment of transplant patient should make this medicine or make changes in the immune response.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant repulsions or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; stimulation of the formulation or regimes should only be performed under primary control of one in the transplant medicine (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosages must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advaginal raf should be primarily based on clinical diagnosis of degrading and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talspiegel should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the Systemic exposure was measured as Talmirror, with both formulations both in kidney and leberransplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspection of the Tacrolimus valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advaginal raf, to ensure appropriate substance exposure in immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, can take an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisado several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition allows no oral intake of medicines in the first post-operative phase, the Tacrolimus treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution).</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application to suppression the transplant-repulant must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendation - kidney transplantation, prophylation prophylaxis The oral Adaesthetic therapy should begin with 0,20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosages can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosing ages - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant cornea treatment should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this changeover in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose is to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After a changeover from other immunosuppresva on Advagraf once daily, the treatment with liver transplantation is recommended for the prophylaxis of grafts.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Dutransplantation In adult patients who are converted to Advaginal, is an oral initiation of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receptors if there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankreas- and darmtransplanted patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage customizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining a blood-term mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function problems.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function, since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can assume that a dose of dose is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including regular determining of the serum lending, calculation of the creatinine and monitoring of the urine) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on Advagraf In case of converting a Cicloso to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the bottom level at full blood. the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of degrading and tolerability in isolated from blood-blood tacrolimus-talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Recommended controls of the Tacrolimus Talspiegel during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels from Tacrolimus should also be used after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adaptation, changes of immune response, or when applying the Tacrolimus-thoroughal concentration. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advaginal raf is a medicines with a low clearing, the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level is not higher in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood levels of Tacrolimus are usually located in the first time following liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for decorating - and heart-splanted patients at 10-20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Normally blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used during the subsequent detection of liver, kidney and cardiac grafts.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has lead to serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in the result of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; stimulation of the formulation or regimes should only be performed under primary control of one in the transplant medicine (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant repulant which has proven to be used against other immunosuppressants as therapist, there are still no clinical data for retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">The prophylaxis of transplant-grafts in adult cardiac grafts and transplants are still no clinical data for retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that lead to a reduction in the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and a weakening of the tactic effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum) may contain, or other plant enhances during a treatment with Advaginal raf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subjected to considerable vibrations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf was observed as a cardiomyopathy chamber or septic hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advaginal raf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorder is an already existing heart suffering, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid overload and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immune suppressources, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection due to a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of Pres like headaches, altered levels of consciousness, convulsions and vision could show a radiological examination (e.g).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advaginal, hard capsules, retardized lactose is included in patients with the rare hereditary Galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-gactose malabsorption special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitor or inductors from CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, the Tacrolimus- blood levels in the current administration of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism to monitor and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain equal concentration levels (see section 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was observed with antifungotics like ketoconazole, fluorconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic study showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulting from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4 which can affect your metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus reduces the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increasing the hormonal exposition, is particularly cautious in decisions about receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments showed that Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their semesters time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations on transplants have no indication that below Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk of unwanted events relating to the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall the safety profile of oral Prograf expressed in these published studies the observations in the major studies in which Prograf is applied with liver, kidney and cardiac transplants to primary immune response.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis about a recently performed, multicentre study with oral Prograf was reported to have been reported using either Tacrolimus or Ciclosa in the context of 1: 1 Randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant tumulatory syndrome, bronchiolitis, was also less common in the first year after transplantation (2,86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year amounted to 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, patients treated in 21,7% of cases in the emergence of a broncholitis in comparison to 38,0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosis had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients suffering from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there was no acute transplant tumulatory occurred after 6 months (57,7% versus 33.3%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) and after 1 year (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis was significantly smaller with the patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentral study of oral prograft was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously subjected to a pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which received randomized Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initiation dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reduced to the aspired blood levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Gut transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunografts were obtained in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multi-visceral transplants) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonists, lower initial doses ranging from 10 to 15 ng / ml and more recently transplant graft radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocritant and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the non-bound faction of Tacrolimus, or an increase in metabolic-induced reinforcement of metabolic should be responsible for transplantation-observed higher clearing rates.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is completely metabolized before the excretion of almost completely metabolized - the excretion mainly takes place on gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were taken from Prograf (twice a day) in proportion of 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the evaluation of available data, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as a positive, but consider that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the security profiles of ADVATE, which requires a subset of PSURs all 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder is supposed to apply for another 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited shared the Committee on Humanitarian Aid (CHMP), that the Company has its request on approval for the treatment of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, the brain, bone or soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and relies) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that was genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been changed so there was no copies of yourself and thus cannot solve infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defect in the human body's p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraud-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient before Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP replies the answers to the questions posed by the company, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial documents, the CHMP submitted 120 list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not adequately proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors will bring benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice CHMP, not knowing whether the feedback has consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "active agent release" "" "means that the tablets are so compounded so that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly emitted for some hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), caused by an allergy to pollen of the nose-nose (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible, once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main activity measurements were the changes in the severity of the hypocritical symptoms, which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">With contemplation of all haylograph symptoms, the patients that aerinaze were reported, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0% compared with 35.9% in the patients, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-mucosa was considered, the patients under aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients suffering from the loratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (calls, headache, headache, insomnia), somnia, insomnia (sleepiness), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used to patients who are possibly more sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients that are used to repaid agents or Loratadin (another drug for treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a bottleneck glaucoma (higher eye pressure), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroic (overfunction of the thyroid) or have already had a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by hemorrhagic stroke) or a risk for haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to approve aerinaze on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is basically to swallow (i.e. without them bite, break down or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to lack of data to inconsistency and efficacy (see section 5.1) for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long term application can take the activity of Pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After slowing down the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapeutic.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoxide oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrials such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, lihydroplergyamin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, ephedrine, nhazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and are not enough to express appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment when treating a hypertension or a speedometer, or of palpitations, heart rhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, be careful: • Patients under digital is • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in angiogenesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder construction or bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is present at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, as antihistamine should otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their scale.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the scope of clinical trials with disloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma centre of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadine and the placebo treated patients were irrespective of whether Desloratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin hemhibits ine-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconsistency of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison with the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor characteristics of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, this can lead to impairment of accidents or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased spiritual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collaps) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, arousnesses and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal insufficiency, palpitations, palpitations, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, predominant pain, dizziness, taxia, optic nerve and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely, as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil and didilation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastine cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of expression of adhesion of the P selecin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In one single dose of adults, Desloratadine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow rates including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily had no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further personalized effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine agonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets were determined based on the total cores for the symptoms (except nasal squadral swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets in regard to the swellant effect, determined by the nasal smucskin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapies with disloratadine over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadine is present within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow rate of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-professional dosing study, which was performed by formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects suffered disloratadin badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-action study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the sole treatment of Pseudoephedrine in bioequivalent was the exposure of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety levels, for toxicity in repeated treatment, for genetic oxicity and reproduction, the pre-clinical data can be seen with disloratadine, however, no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no larger toxicity as its individual components, and the observed effects generally stood in connection with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducing xicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine in the oral treatment of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1717">According to the market launch of Desloratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (breath-not, whistling, itching, hichhikes and swelling) or skin rash were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">More cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, crutness, pain problems, cases of liver inflammation and over cases of striking liver values were also rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg-, 5 mg- and 5 mg of melting tablet (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergy-rhinitis and two trials in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by adjusting the alteration of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to reflect that the body utilises the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius were at a mean decrease in the symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32% compared to the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both trials in Urticaria the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to patients treated with placebo was 40 and 33% compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against loratadine, loratadine, or any other parts.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the European Commission to approve Aerius transport network in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Desloratadin in the youth of 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to previous symptoms and can be resumed after resigning the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allyday period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with disloratadin tablets that erythromycin or ketoconazole were also administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study of the current consumption of Aerius and alcohol, the effective effects of alcohol was not amplified (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, this can lead to impairment of accidents or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of the patients who were treated with loratadine and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastine cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion of P selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses, in the desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval was given.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dossier study with adults, Desloratadin showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the flow rates including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Nieses, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrience and redness of the eyes and itching to the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be subdivided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As using the total cores of the questionnaire to quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the pollution caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria is representative of further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to etiology in different forms and chronic patients can be prospective prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all urgenic diseases, it is expected that Desloratadine is in addition to the chronic idiopathic urticaria in other forms of urticaria to improve symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of churitus, and the reduction in size and number of squares at the end of the first dosing interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients, who did not react to antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with disloratadine treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which were comparable to patients suffering from the general seasonally allergic rhinitis in the population of 4%, was reached with a higher concentration of Desloratadine in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinical relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of the loratadin enzyme, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin in vivo not hemmed CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty acid rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin, with a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no quality or quantitative differences concerning the toxicity profiles of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety levels, toxicity in repeated treatment, genotoxicity and to reproduction, the pre-clinical data can be recognized by disloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains Lactose monohydrate, hypocrless, titanium dioxide, Macroocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains HypromRNA, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, catalyst wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribers doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available, which support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, angiogenesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metaboliatadin constrained and experienced a higher substitution (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which constrained metabolize, is identical to those with children who are normal metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains Saccharose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not take any inherent problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or saccharase isinsufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally used (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study of the current consumption of Aerius tablets and alcohol, the effective effects of alcohol is not amplified (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, up to 45 mg of desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old, who came for an antihistamine therapy in question, received a daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the effectiveness of desloratadin can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study of multiple adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg, Aerius tablets led to no impairment of psychomotor in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, it was caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol, neither to a gain of alcohol-induced loss reductions or increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as Nieses, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrience and redness of the eyes as well as itching to the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As using the total cores of the questionnaire to quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduces the seasonally allergic rhinitis.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu, caused by the strain of influenza A virus (Type) H5N1 of influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine which might cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the influenza virus appears that humans can easily spread from human beings, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus as" "" "body alienation" "" "and antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form this case in contact with an influenza virus of this case.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "" "" surface antigens "" "" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as body alien), has been attained and used as a component of the vaccine. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should then be prescribed, if the doctor has examined, which has taken an antiviral drug to the patient before, and the likelihood has judged the virus to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice a day 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral drugs, Agenerase reduces the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure AIDS, however, damage to the immune system and therefore delays the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral drugs, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with Protease Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase increased with low dosire Ritonavir increased pharmaceuticals for 206 adults who had taken earlier protease inhibitor, compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Basic indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-demonstrable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the changes of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the trials with patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children Agenerase likewise reduced the viral load, however, of the children who had been treated earlier with Protease Inhibitors, were only very few for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had been treated earlier with Protease Inhibitors, this was equally effective with Ritonavir increased drug Agenerase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patient with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir a more powerful decrease of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who had their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (blood piles), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against amphoravir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who are careged (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are exploited just like Agenerase and harmful in high concentrations in the blood health precaution.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase are taking the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (symptoms of infection) or an immune reactivation (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Use Case (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected with HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefits of Agenerase have taken in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group to approve the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase is to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosts with low doses of Ritonavir (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amoxetr should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance samples and the treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amoxetr as a solution to intake is less than 14% less than capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and a solution are not interchangeable for a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amoxetr twice daily together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amoxetr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data to inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adults should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treating Agenerase does not prevent risk of transfer from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy, have an increased risk of severe liver interaction with potentially lethal history.</seg>

<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluid or other Glucolocorifids, which are confused about CYP3A4, it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the replacment of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent from CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medications, which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Normally Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma particles (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amoxhor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be changed, however the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opiatentationsysymptoms, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir are also given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propyl glycolitis of the Agenerase solution, this is contraindicated by children under an age of four years and should be used with caution at certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6-Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase can not be given together with medicines, whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma glucose with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in AUC from Amsands, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="1970">A dosing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended that it is not known to its effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study conducted in combination with didanosine, but is recommended because of antacids component of didanosine, however, that the revenues of didanosin and Agenerase will lie at least one hour (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice a day) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) no dose is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with amplitudes in combination with amplavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin possibly reduces the serum concentration of Ambravir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable, since Delavirdin may be less effective because of the lower or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amenoravir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amenoravir and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmacabutin (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required along with Agenerase in order to reduce the dose of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma screens of both medicines might be increased in the case of simultaneous appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of deveconazole once daily resulted in an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole on 2.69times a day, which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day, which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day, without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, can be used together with Agenerase might lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva which are known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amoxhor, can result in a humiliation of the plasma clots of Amphavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, disparazem, dilupine, nicodipine, pine-pin and verapamil can be increased 10 by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase can increase their plasma centages and intensify using PDE5 inhibitors in related side effects including hypotension, vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) were significantly increased, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these Glucolocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of treating a risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose rejects vary greatly from CYP3A4, depend on the plasma glucose levels in the current administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma stress increases of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor which can lead to myopathy, including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with amoxetr.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma-centrations of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the same gift of amoxetr (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">In this case, Agenerase is not allowed to be used with oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while respecting Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase of plasma samples from Midazolam to the 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with amicavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opiatentationsysymptoms, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir are also given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the per se low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as the Amprenavir- dosage is to be administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the current administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, a reinforced control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contrazeptiva is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and Nortryptlin) is recommended in the current gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used by careful removal of possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2004">Most of the adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly uplifting, competed early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">With many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are used in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protease inhibitors, patients were not treated 1,200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on Genotypic resistance analysis, Genotypic interpretations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-Algorithm defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, L33F, M36I, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a increased phenotypical resistance to Fosamprenavir as well as a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions on the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always test current interpretations systems to analyze resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenotypic resistance tests, Klinisch validated phenotypic interpretations can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data for the evaluation of the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cruciresistence against Ritonavir, sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir but is generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cruciresistence between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossil-aviary resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of five-five antiretroviral patients (one of them), a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), the Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor isolates; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with the lowest knurned Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with reduced virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average exchange rate (AAUCMB) in the viral load (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sault shaft of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 with PI were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was given three mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day, and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dovic Ritonavir given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously administered at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the treatment of patients with PI pretreated children should be considered as expected benefit of "unconventional" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration of up to the maximum serum concentration of Amsands is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, reduced by 30% for Cmax. if Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was given to Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amoxetr 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Consequently, the minimum concentration of the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food influences the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a distilled penetration of amphoravir from the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of active substances in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amenorrhea, representing the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amoxy remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients in the steady state in the steady state across the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medications that induce CYP3A4 or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4 will be given when they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amprenavir exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amstraavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligramasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearing of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function is likely to be low to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amprenavir plasma particles comparable to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg amoxetr twice a day, without simultaneous appointments of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the czerogeneity of mice and rats, with male animals benign hepatric cells in dosages, with the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- triple (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatcellular adenoma and carcinomas was not yet resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both clinical trials and the therapeutic use, there were little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro gene tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), microcore test of rats and chromosomal test results in human peripheral lymphocytes contained, was amphoravir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical use by the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals, which were treated from age 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals of the Amprenavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) when the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage was observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amoxetr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should occur in patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medications, which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Normally Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies with the measured dosages (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Serum concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and lived between 9 and 12 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bag) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated value of semites was about 10 times higher than the 2hourly halftime after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low and comparable to MC ill skin of patients at age 6-12 and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supersonic basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG was significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; one also performed four months in the same study compared with the mouse there was no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice was inducted at the application site for three days a week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod is only a small systemic absorption from human skin and not mutagenic is a risk for human exposure as a very low view.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free crème, sooner and in larger numbers than in the control group with minor UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata), formed on the skin in the area of genitals (genitals) and the anus (after) is a superficial, slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it may lead to deorders, particularly in the face - hence a early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic fellows are rough areas of the skin, which have been exposed to people during their previous lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied for flat actinic keratosis in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system with the production of natural substances, which help your body to combat superficial basal cell carcinoma, or to combat actinic keratosis, or for infection with feigning.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with a diagnosis of a sample with a sample in a sample of a sample of the disease (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glyceraminoglykane, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damaging them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements difficult, diminished lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be done in a hospital or clinic with revitational equipment, and patients need to prevent the medicine in order to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (in terms of reducing genetic concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash), arthralgia, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions on the infusion outlet.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects of patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used to treat patients who may react strongly (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update all new information, which may be known, verify and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the approval of Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using a recombinant DNA technology using Cho-Mammtier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a sample in a sample of ysacchariot I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried through a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial incineration rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient wears this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any other side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion of Infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be supervised, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be provided in an appropriate clinical environment where revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients were IgG antibody against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment start.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related response must be treated with care of Aldurazyme with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery after a longer break, due to the theoretical risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, it must be cautious after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or moderate infusion-related response the treatment of antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related response, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are declining, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed after a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Because no data is exposed to newborns which exposed to Laronidase on the breast milk, it is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical studies were classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed at 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the period of 45 patients at age 5 or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table after the following frequencies: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs, there were also severe reactions, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at age 5, with a greater severe overflow form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once per week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once per week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients the treatment occurred within 3 months after the beginning of treatment to a seroconversion, with the patients at age 5 years of age (average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until an early withdrawal from the study) were not present in 13 / 45 patients suffering from radio immune cipital (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, including 3 patients with which it never occurred to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to low antibodies referred to a robust reduction in Gag SLR in Harn, while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of gag in Harn was fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal up to low-neutralizing repair effect on the enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of Gag im Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies didn't seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for hydrolysis of the accumulated substrates and preventing a further accumulation of an accumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly dispersed from the cycle and cells in Lysosomes, most likely to use Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 3 study at age 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients had been identified by the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute enclings in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme to improve lung function and capacity to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects could be up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as from the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">In contrast, the decline in the compared comparative percentage of FEV is clinically significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepategaly treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clearer waste of the Gag-Spiegel in Harn (µg / mg of Creatinine) was established, which remained constant by the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease modulation of patients suffering from a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk test, motion area of the epauldron Ahi and visual acuity) was generally used in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients, which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy overflow form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn per week 22 in the past 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a magnitude growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined by the Z-score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mid-run form had a normal mental development speed, whereas only limited or no progress in the cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various altdurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag-Spiegel in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once per week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once per week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can result in patients who have difficulty with weekly inserts; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosis was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulation in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K remained as well as beta carotins in the norm range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to include a supplementary multivitoba prior to bedtime to ensure adequate vitality (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the treatment of one-one dose Amiodaron was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, at the same time, orlistat, a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasmaconcentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">In experimental studies, no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with the orlistat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency on basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of knowing side effects, which were noted after the launch of orlistat, is not known since these events were voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size.</seg>

<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects, without any significant clinical findings occur.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of the cases reported by Orlistat-overdosing, either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animal can be assumed by a quick recovery of any systemic effects that can be attributed to lipasemming properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is set in the lumen of the gastric acid and the upper small intestine to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and Pancreatic Lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orlistat taken three times daily, the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fetch is blocked.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy with severe trigger for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), and for chemotherapies, the intermediate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Application in patients under the age of 18 will not be recommended because the effects in this age range does not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is preventing a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy with strong or intermediate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients showed no vomiting with Aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In case of chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi have no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strong empowerment chemotherapy for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate empowering chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strong empowerment chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one before chemotherapy-given corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon case, patients with amnesty observations or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable to extend Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- interval is prolonged or that tend to an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy alone, Aloxi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy alone for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron not inhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyberabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, electropoxetine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, cotoxetine, quinoa, Sertrine and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies not lie in case of human pregnancies, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms of observed side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly stood with aloxi in the context (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions by appointment (burning, curing, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effectiveness to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy with a aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of carotorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given in day 1 without the examethasone intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong empowerment chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 microgram Palonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg ondansetron, which were given in day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with oceveal chemotherapy and the study with strong empowering chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the feconds pre-clinical trials Palonosetron owns the capability to block the iterations of the ventricular de- and Repolarisation process and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EKG effects of I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows a slow elimination from the plasma centre a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma level (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in total dose range from 0,3- 90 ° g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average mean age between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma stage at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) compared to a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax after the one-time of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary Metabolites, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolic have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of the CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose could be found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolting projection, the whole body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, terminale Eliminationshalbexpectus and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron increases, however, reducing the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate for the maximum treatment of human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 The clinical trials showed evidence that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a greater frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasm (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, tributary mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the high doses and because Aloxi is determined for unique application, the relevance of these results will be evaluated.</seg>

<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of reference case to 455 patients.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were warned that data will not suffice to stability of the nutrient and market drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, related to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjustment of the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again retarded with more patients than with the reference case; too, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, in the study, the test was conducted in the study, in what is the drug an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a related skin infection) and small infested ingestion (cracks or secutes), depreciation and inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used to treat infections that have been provoked or probably caused by methicillinresistenosis Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years old may not be more than 2% of the body surface to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address two to three days after treatment, the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was removed after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients were conducted under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwunden, about 90% of both groups were involved in the treatment of both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo has been detected in the treatment of abscary (eitful cavities in the body tissue) or by infection that have been provoked or presumably by MRSA are not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with alclogo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use Case (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo during the short-term treatment of the following superficial al infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, depreciation or wires.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. to approve the transport of Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who show no improvements within two or three days, should be investigated once again and considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or heavy local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully scanned and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin was caused by patients suffering from a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centwork that has been reached upon people after topical use on the poor skin or infected with superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo work is not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the time of oral treatment of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not necessary when topical retapamulin was applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproducing xicity after oral ingestion and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding is continued / ended or the therapy with Altargo continued / ended, it is weakened between the benefits of the nursing infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect on the final destination was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance produced by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckananus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The retapamulin mechanism is based on the selective inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain binding place of the 50s sub unit of bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the binding place of other ribosomal interagierant antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the bond-centre of ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-binding station and the Peptidyltransferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through liaison to this bond site, Pleuromutiline gives the peptidal transfer, block partial P-binding stellations and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-bosomes units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of the local prevalence of resistance to retapamulin may appear in at least some infections, should advise an advice through experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin towards S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulators were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-speaking to S.aureus treatment the presence of trunks with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was released daily under occlusion to intact and on scanned skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary medical wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of poor skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Hemlock.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microphones was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro verification on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microcore test chromosomal effects of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has reached up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest possible exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 with swollen skin):</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient temperature is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix will be used within two doses of existing vaccinations, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine will be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, ambient temperature or other hepatitis C or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by adding the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens than "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine of Twinrix adults and since 1997 approved vaccination Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix Children are given existing vaccinations in the frame of a three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are present identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective anti-cell concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient temperature in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children spent a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the ambient temperature at Ambirix was at a six-month and at a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, mattiness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive to patients who may react to drugs, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the GlaxoSmithKline Biologras.a to approve the ambient temperature of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grunrix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster vaccination is requested for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B- and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) virus (anti-HAV) -antibodies are in the same order as following the vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunological competent individuals who have addressed a collection of hepatitis revaccination, as they may have no more demonstrable antibodies to be protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectioncompounds the rare cases of anaphylactic response should be available immediately according to the treatment of the vaccine, according to the treatment of the vaccine, according to the treatment of medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standarmpfschema is recommended with the combination vaccination which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis patients and individuals with disturbanishment of the immune system, no sufficient anti-hAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved, so in these cases, the gift of other vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal vaccine result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenia or blood clots, Ambiani can be injected equally subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases following intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of separate injection, tetanic and Haemophilus influenza, type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined Masern- Mumps vaccine was administered, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosdefensive therapy or in patients with immunodeficiency, that may have no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that has been crossed with 3 vaccination of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matuenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in previous Thiomeric and preservative-containing vaccination formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the ambience of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses of combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maternity on a calculation basis per vaccum Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39,1% of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66,4% of the subjects, the Ambirix had to get given, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matory was relatively high (i.e. above the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects received at Ambiani, compared to 36.2% for the subjects who received the 3-doses of combinations.)</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and mattness was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination vaccination with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to which, with the 3-doses of combined hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, is not reported per pro-band.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of imports, which reported severe side effects during the 2-doses at Ambirix or during the 3-doses terminal with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at vaccines at age 1 to and including 15 years, were the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was carried out at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses at Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combined with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than at Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 in the case of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. 7 month 7), are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, imports are either a 2-doses vaccinations with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccinema with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of the Grundimmunization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies have been detected for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies are comparable to 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life coincided with a combined diphthie-, tetanic and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar formulation and power conversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2785">In a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis-A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective stock levels (360 ELISA units of a formal infected hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a real hepatitis B surface coating).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective stock is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination to terminate the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from people who suffer heavy bleeding problems, under the skin and not in the muscle injected. • If you are weak / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body's own defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient can be given in these cases, but the immune response can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficiently large and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at Ambirix at the same time, should be vaccinated on separate places and as possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambient temperature is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of infancy in blood, depression, irritability, headache, pain relief, pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, rash or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use Case (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonium is effectively prevented from patients with disturbances of the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the condition of the disease, only limited information about this medicine was given.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete Enzymmangel already manifested in the newborn (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (infected encephalic, which is manifested after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when Anamnese consists of hypertropic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by the protein tolerance and the patient's needed daily intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamboo phosphate, or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinatase deficiency need to get arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallow disorders, as there is a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, correspondingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and Ödembildung in advanced clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In a subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuron multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturity of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted into the breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS has contraindicated during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients at least one undesirable event (AE) occurred at least 78% of these adverse events that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with Lakaemia, severe hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with a single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms can with an accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosing limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active link, which is conjugated by acetylene with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of urine cycle can be accepted, that for each gram of the sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early prematurely and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the newborn was almost always infallized, and the disease even resulted in treating peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their inflection-free analogous in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxidiate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), proteinated chost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate from postpartal (however within the first life of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and had already been treated before the first appearance of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100% but even in these patients suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygine scarring form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency, which were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients, a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys of glutamine with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metastases in plasma and urine samples were obtained in a dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in nulary healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of urine, and repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma centages of phenylbutyrat were established.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from urea-cyclical or hemoglobinopathy was present after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) at the next morning, no phenylacetate in plasma at the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentration in the plasma masons were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no less toxic effects (study 24 and 48 h after oral dosing from 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children who do not swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or over a gastrostomieschlalso or a nasal onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamboo phosphate, or ornithintranscarbamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat orders were exposed to the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolit of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) has been reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with Lakaemia, severe hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of urine-cycle can be assumed that for each gram of the sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients may cause further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma centages of phenylbutyrat were established.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this procedure, the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to get the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">Patients with these rare diseases are absent certain liver enzymes, so that they accumulate the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducted laboratory studies, you must inform the doctor that you use AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines, even if it is not prescription medicine, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding, you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS as the drug may skip the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion and headaches, headaches, imbalances, delimity, memory disorders, and deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you encounter any of these symptoms, start immediately with your doctor or with the emergency photo of your hospital for purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the ingestion of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood image (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), reduced appetite, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, kidney failure, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you will notice side effects, which are not specified in this manual information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS according to the box on the box and use the container after "useable" to "use the expiry date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS, and content of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval shape, and they are provided with the label "UCY 500."</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS spread over the same individual doses or via a Magenfistula (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly in the stomach) or a nasal onde (hose, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Use a straight edge out of the container, for example, remove a straight canal, e.g. a measuring spot on the upper edge of the knife to remove surplus granulate. • Use the recommended amount of measuring scoop out of the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiography is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) or myocardial infarction.</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angioxification is used to prevent blood clots in patients suffering from a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and raise the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox occurs with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another drug concerning the prevention of blood clots) with the conventional combination with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used to patients (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock) and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood clots like Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks, or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI, angioxin was equally effective in terms of indicators such as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludine or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Furthermore, it may not be used in patients that recently had bleeding, as well as people with severe blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that angiography is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to launch an authorization of Angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-Hebdo) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiography in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another episode, additional bolus should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and increase infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one itself immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT, after 5 minutes) has been shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of only 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be used carefully before applying.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients suffering from severe kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which will be subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower incineration rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval phase III- PCI-study (Replace-2), which was included for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus in an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients is angiogenicity (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unquestioned heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous gift of lower molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• 2 known hypersensitivity to the substance or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active hemorrhage or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of hemostatic and / or irreversibly bacterial endocrditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI patients appear under bivalirudine in most of the arterial points of arterial points, in patients suffering from a subcutaneous coronarintervention (PCI), in principle it may occur everywhere in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and are treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR value (International Normally ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after placing the treatment with Bivalirudin is once again completed before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action of anticoagulancia (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregates), these substances can increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudine, with thrombogenic aggregates or anticoagulation, clinical and biological hemostasis is to control regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental examinations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, which is insufficient or the postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIA injections and 4603 were randomized to either unquestioned heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative groups were treated with women and patients over 65 years old and more frequently in adverse events than male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding have been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding in the 2 notes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding came under Bivalirudine alone less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor and bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemostasis of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobin reflection of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobin reflection of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reconstructive surgery based on blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occur in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points of point, gastrounding, gastrounding, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with bivalirudine in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative groups were treated with women and patients over 65 years old and more frequently in adverse events than male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred at Bivalirudin significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported after extensive use in practice and are listed according to systems organclasses listed in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately interrupt and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor, which binds both at the catalyst centre as well as at the Anioneneck region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudine in Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turn slowly up the binding of Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine, with serum of patients, in which it had come to heparininduced thrombozytopenia / heparininducised thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), induce not throcytes aggregating reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect controlled by extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional value of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, infractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Coronarsyndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST upscale infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected or injected with the upper arm or an infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or does not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisins differs very slightly from humanoid, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter duration than a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra became in combination with a long-effective insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes in which the body insulin does not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycolic hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% compared to insulin is found.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in case of human normal problems.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, to apply or subcutaneous or subcutaneous through continuous infusion to the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose load capacity and the reduced insulin release, the insulin requires a limitation of liver function in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity levels, the trademark (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can take a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulatory diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic carveazione; these conditions are potentially limenacing.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin produced in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances which increase blood sugar levels and increase inclination to Hypoglycerides, oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-lockers, Clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the symptoms of repurepurepuation will be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on refractory tests did not show any differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanoid related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-lulism occurs in the human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur in the breast milk, nor will it resorted to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the clinical trials listed in clinical studies, groups are listed according to system organic classes and arranged according to decreasing the frequency of their rising (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10;</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual arrestation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive disease, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipoystrophy is failed to change the injection point within the injection enrich, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site in a row.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycerides with impelessness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of the severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeleton muscles and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous hydro-be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the effect duration shorter than with hu- manly normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin produced in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg amounts to a dose of proportional glucose effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose effect, just like humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulin has a twice as fast effect as normal humanoid and achieves the complete glucose effect about 2 hours earlier than humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data there was obvious that during an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar postprandiale glycemic control is achieved, as is given up to 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before meal was taken, was achieved a better postprandiale control than given to the meal that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">In 15 minutes, insulin delivery will be turned into at least 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is given as in case of human normal, which is 2 Mi- grooves before meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given as compared to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) before a meal (figure 1 B) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in the gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- Males, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
