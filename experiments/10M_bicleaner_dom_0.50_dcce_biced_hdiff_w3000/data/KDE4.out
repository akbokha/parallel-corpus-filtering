package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
for more information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings , select the card tools and select the modules required there .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de package ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which includes &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of waste , if available , er@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; with the module , you &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current work directory can filter to different kind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root tip of the document , for example : the document@@ an element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root shield .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text messages to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in the form of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically displayed . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , fs@@ view can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ t@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the colour of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched over to color mode , can be either a depth for the slight detection of the fl@@ avo@@ ids or the picture of another file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify if there is enough space for displaying , or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rec@@ tan@@ gles is present , then you can set the relative position of the label in rec@@ t@@ angle .
in case of time algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the size should be adher@@ ed to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this goal is not always adher@@ ed to the size of the entries , and this framework will not always be provided , so that less space for the frame is lost when rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
as an arrangement of the surface is carried out for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation is left to it . in this case , it is possible for the label and to avoid space losses incur@@ red by the framework , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created as possible . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second division .
you can specify the minimal surface of an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

from the thumb@@ nail you can compare the pictures you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and display there . if you can sync from the tool bar and perform z@@ apping on one of the images , then they will be able to compare the same section of the two images .
another mode is better suited to display quickly from a series of series . if you use p@@ airing mode from the tool bar , then you can display the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail in order to display it on your left . this is the right picture shown in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies itself through a number of similar images .
naturally , normal bra@@ ids work directly from the light as e.g. F4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it possible for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in piv@@ ot function , which you can detect on the crossed arrows . to hold the visible range of the image , you have to click on this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then , in mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ kno@@ b under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are viewing in mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - aside from the process of fashion ? digital stock management looks after the picture taken after the picture has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent store . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ plug . we consider to use , backup , backup , evaluate , backup , optimize , maintain , waiting , and export output files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes stock , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ized , secure , seeks , kon@@ f@@ ected and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is defined according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data being managed by a application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will definitely need to find a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use this database as well as in the image files . if you don &apos;t even have quick search and secure archi@@ ving to access you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you want to build any of your system . you must decide whether you want to save it on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them on a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive sometime .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location . if you were able to organize your date in one year . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files do match ? the separation of file types makes stac@@ king processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option stored in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? for this , &amp; digi@@ plug is provided with them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , since you want to select each photo words , lab@@ eling and review . of course , you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now talk with keywords , keywords , as you are often called by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you have cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded sampling , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically setting the tree to the right place . the revers@@ ing of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are being updated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated while there is the lower trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is cut , because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data consists of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ise your metadata .
most of you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos just simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are safe to arrive like your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , space .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you can begin to dream , associations , the historic period is again present , you may even hear the silence of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer , to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with an inscription for themselves alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can even export a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time . if you export your pictures to web @-@ galleries , you &apos;ll have to tell the story so much for the publishing process no second time .
remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train is already running with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are inn@@ um@@ erable . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your journeys with ge@@ ographic information . so you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; using Google goo@@ gle maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographers , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then it can no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author row ) : associated with the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of the photographer , freelance photographer , freelance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author , it must be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who this photo offers . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , this will be shown here . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they don &apos;t offer any protection against abuse . anyone who has little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is only very important to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for forkli@@ ft processing in the near future .
topics : record defects , record out@@ age , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission error , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that you can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , these are problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics , which has a loss of data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these can be treated more difficult and you cannot get more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that has a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your read@@ just@@ ment room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices . the best DVD covers are not more expensive than the cheapest , but they write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistake , even if you just have written a control box mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control cases . in spite of this massive dust they are needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it works with Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to get damaged disks of damaged disks , hard@@ disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus said almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs is also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in an un@@ propri@@ ated format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author license and afterwards protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ car@@ case retain their statistics for itself . your produc@@ erg@@ ents include a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ rup@@ tive study
shortly , dis@@ cos will be at the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature control , this error may not determine the immediate im@@ min@@ ent failure . some of SM@@ ART sends an im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially readers and publishing companies . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current failure , but these losses are normally recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices Power@@ ed not much , this can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , complete data loss , hard@@ ships and other defects . so protect yourself from the un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest gro@@ unded . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . remember that not every plug @-@ bar contains also an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should mind that it ful@@ fills the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects against lighten@@ ing and protects the connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers can also provide over@@ voltage sp@@ ills which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , they are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete out@@ age . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting your devices , these devices can automatically adjust the power failure . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run down the system . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk to be exposed to your computer system and get rid of its security in power problems with the cost to avoid this . this is only a small price difference if you may concern your computer with it . at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data .
in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar cost ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data across the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online memory services that are limited to photos . their free memory will not be available to you in the case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be verified only in reality .
from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol , and in the large companies offer backup and a partial memory . therefore , they are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that you don &apos;t tell us if this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . it is quite distur@@ bing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission lu@@ sts , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scal@@ able at low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the notebook and 46 % of the work@@ load systems . for not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think . it is limited to lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for long .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ative process during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . the idea is that the technology continues to develop . sensitivity and characteristic characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ ad sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras are your limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk can be held today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for any data loss . so , if you do not have any other data loss after one plan and test this up before you do something dangerous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , make the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster beats locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ bow gives always a non @-@ local storage . bring your backup up the stairs , into the adjacent house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above already is a common reason for a data loss despite ensuring the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
a complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot of two times : the full backup and that of the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . this backup will restore the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is just sliding and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machine . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to DVD or another visual medium .
this approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup yet with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
themes : metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ...
so valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period of time you &apos;re really interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies to be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to consider and re@@ assess everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain wax . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to zoom in on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it on .
&amp; ped@@ ro ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ B ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no longer exists , you can create this self . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . but it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is needed for a lot of administration , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F . this format will recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as an image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ g@@ ger@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is , however , that this format has been adapted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a license @-@ free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and required to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera regulator is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe is introduced to replace his XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; it is a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mix of XML and quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file information ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , but it records the metadata separately from the image file . it can be seen separately from the link between the metadata and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of application and business models . on the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the reader or scanner . as long as you can use the pictures on the camera , you can use it as a temporary f@@ use .
convert rough files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a very complex editing , you can use external programs . if you use the images back to &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the metadata back . these were cut off from other programs under circumstances .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it to Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in m@@ peg , use in contact , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section add a photo to an album , you can find a description as you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a pig@@ mentary indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file access for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a single entry and metadata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information , which is internally saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , all information is available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remark , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this invites you to check all photos of their camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug . in downloading the pictures will not be deleted and we will advise you if you delete pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button download and then download the chosen selected . the button selected is as long as you have selected , until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new images are selected with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , you will only download the new images .
if you can download or download the buttons , select a dialog with which you can select the target album , in which the pictures are dis@@ car@@ ded , displayed as usual folders . the list of existing albums can be read in the section My Albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selected the finish album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all this by using the button delete all . if you only want to delete the button , then you must select them first and then delete the deleted .
note that there is no way to re@@ build photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , the photos will not be deleted at the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to er@@ ase your photo album . if you want to er@@ ase them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should take it over the camera name , as this is much faster .
cameras are often used as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ leg@@ ated after the photos taken from the camera . this can be useful to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to in@@ corporate the date and time in which the image has been made to in@@ corporate the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for data @-@ based under@@ age . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created each day .
the options During the transmission opens three additional options , which are done before the photos on the plate are stored . if you select this , the respective entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another date format as the standard format , can be used for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix Photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the possibility to change the file name in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed under the name shown in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera window for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to prepare a automatic turn during shut@@ ting . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the picture lets you turn off . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button enlarged and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has information about the date printed on which the photo was made available , and digi@@ plug can be used on the image data . all images with the same date will be provided in the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date are available . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ Data you can read which information that your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this , you must select this option and select the option Dat@@ eline @-@ based lower at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file extensions dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images should be loaded , select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a browser to another &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users can therefore want to document the location of the photos , or simply document the location data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is a lot of GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to get this up . directly with the correct hardware , using the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers , either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but they need to save this data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude @-@ grade or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates that can be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings to select the behavior of digi@@ plug ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left .
you can select action on one @-@ bet preview or start @-@ up . thus , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains as shown below , the stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data field . this data will be automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data center . this data is also written with database synchron@@ ization , these data will be written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author row : this field should be the profession of a photographer , freelance photographer , freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this should be filled with .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if this picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save data into the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . thereby the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without being lost .
image files as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you will also add to your photos , using the labels embedded in the pictures , these are already written by those of &amp; digi@@ plug ; over@@ written by the images .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window on a file . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which data types &amp; digi@@ plug ; signi@@ fy , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . any file in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; album folders which has none of these extensions ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset to you by pressing the button Re@@ fresh from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ plug can be set on this page . however , some pictures have switched on this page . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch the tool bar when using the screen mode in full screen mode .
the image and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark or bright color in the picture . these colours are specified here . in the image processing , this approach can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for close explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression approach , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality as P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . here means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F @-@ files option , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ g@@ ger@@ m for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not influence the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works without any loss .
with the setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can freely save . even if you select the loss of loss and file size better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but it was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the default im@@ print is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gr@@ ate pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white comparison of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white comparison is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details into the top @-@ lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your camera are embedded in the settings , because of the in@@ ability of your camera show the top @-@ light in the settings . finally , you can solve the illumin@@ ation in various ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can re@@ construct a few parts of the missing information from the plants .
this is possible because the blue pixels in general do not boil as fast as green and red . &amp; Ds try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; however , to keep the time for the demo icing , you should be conservative .
a demo application algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data sensor , which have many cameras and that creates a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ g ; and D@@ cra@@ w have three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it was produced as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ity @-@ directed ) was the first algorithm to look at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution to acceptable results .
if you know the color variation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are carried out during the conversion rate .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and statements as they should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information as the colour information of a colour space in the others are to be translated as precisely as possible .
behavior Issues when a picture is opened in image processing and start color administration module with raw files .
color profile folder S@@ Put here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / s@@ color / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine this folder during the start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to leave . everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures of color does not manage the screen .
the input profiles should be done to the camera cre@@ ators and model you are using . not all profiles are based on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to convert x@@ cra@@ b Gamma not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the colour mapping .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your picture of a device would be given back . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can be very satisfied , instead of changing to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is fore@@ seen for them . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon Profile extension lets the style realize : F for an accurate style , L for Land@@ scap@@ es , N for Ne@@ ut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that can support from a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image balances and image processing . many modules support which are written to work together with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these will be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some examples in the context menu .
Short@@ cuts for tasks used by modules can set in the menu under settings Short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper regulator will adjust the time between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes will switch the metadata or look at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera properties indicate a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are currently supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / c , specify where you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and switch on .
pro@@ f you , if &amp; digi@@ plug came ; the camera will automatically detect the camera . if not , you can setup a camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will appear in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can add all of them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ clu@@ sion dialog for the shifting of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the inter@@ loc@@ ality of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and delete a album , you will find more details . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be tac@@ kled by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button .
you can also display the view of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ plug ; i.e. , under the circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
the setting B@@ m Start to new photos are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ plug ; the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos . if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you whether it should delete this from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be chosen under settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be displayed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tool tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be initiated by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of the image and selecting the entry / editing pane .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ tive , enlar@@ ging factor and current image size shows .
one menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo , before you use File Save or the button Save out of the tool bar , once you have saved the original photo , once you saved the image .
so you should possibly produce a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it by file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the button restore or use the button Create button restore in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have carried out on the photo since the last store .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by using editing res@@ um@@ res@@ sions or restored by selecting editing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the key abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to reverse and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ age @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the back bar or restore button in tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will select a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions will be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the photo editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation bar in the tool@@ bar , image below or the entries in the menu . if you want to make changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
in the picture you can zoom in and zoom in to C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or use the entries in the tool@@ bar .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : extension factor automatically
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come in the normal view , where you do not want to use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can use this in the set dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window . view the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , select the image file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the Main Menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . whole screen pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar at the right hand side which provides important information and promotions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation panels , even in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can insert or insert the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields to allow you to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII @-@ characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted to other applications . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on , use either the button users or simply switch to the next picture , the labels will be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting , which is always written in the images .
the section reviews shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the assessment is written into the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search@@ box to fil@@ tering the keyword , the keyword and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug .
the keyword will be adjusted dynam@@ ically to the input keyword . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is very useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of sample words in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keyword can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field of Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the side@@ bar code is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling and search settings . if in addition , one or more sampling filter is used in the right @-@ hand side , only the interface of these two will be displayed . all configured keywords are available .
you can also pull down and lay down . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . as a result there will be a dialogue that asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on one calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no keywords , and afterwards , a keyword out of the right keyword is drawn to the selection and put down there . a dialogue is asked whether this keyword will be set .
these search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also get off @-@ off under settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why not listed Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr yet ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly addressed &amp; digi@@ came ; s more specific implementation .
the reason why one sets a color@@ ized workflow , which is the colors used by your camera or scanner . with a colour @-@ managed work@@ flows , you can easily print the colors on your monitor to those of your camera or scanner which you can print or publish them from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the theme comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you enough background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed choices to make you the desired result .
if your imag@@ ery meets all the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so , if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ i @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om Ex@@ ente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cra@@ ck my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space , or not , you have to cra@@ ck your monitor , because s@@ RGB controls on s@@ RGB format , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , compar@@ ative , automatic and contrast extending from the menu to correct automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aled down the whole picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot so bright as possible without changing its colour sha@@ ding . this feature is often a mag@@ ic correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
comparison : this method adjust the illumin@@ ative factor of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of the image is as flat as possible . in this way , the hist@@ ogram of intensity of a picture , sometimes it produces just rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which can either produce miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ area .
contrast : this method improves contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image due to post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and may be a good correction for bad photos .
the white comparison of &amp; digi@@ plug came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited because of a color space can occur with 8 @-@ bit color . if you can do so far from the original image , in case you can perform the white comparison to the shell mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options are to make the correction better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ balance sheet which is protected by copyright Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ s . they start with the menu entry colors white comparison of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target machine . if you want to see the original icon again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview photos features a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of pixels under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram will appear as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum appears . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma off . the shadow Just@@ ierung lets you improve the sha@@ ded details of your photos or down here .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values .
additionally you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of pixels is exposed . this will display the combined result in the white comparison . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the definitive image .
the buttons save as and store do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set , you can save them in a text file and later re@@ charge .
the button pres@@ ets sets all the filter values back to its standard values and their neutral white balance . note that neutral setting can be shown a different photo than your original . when you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ung@@ lasses per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this encoding is also needed for high @-@ quality images . this encoding requires only for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles , you can rate the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu under color Ton@@ er correction . this tool allows you to save several color channels simultaneously , so you can also use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the correct correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Far@@ be@@ et , offers four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ en@@ filter .
in times of chemical processing was solar , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure , the delicate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier replaced the sensitive photo light . the result was a partial negative of the image . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible is . another raise produces a neg@@ ativity scene that is not designed to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that has been processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation that it has a stronger contra@@ sting effect , making the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted con@@ verse color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth imaging structure . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus , the character@@ ize make him a film of choice for wildlife photography . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot , but also some photographers , especially for which the hardly landscapes can be used .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide read@@ ings . in big pictures the filter can la@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to adjust the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you &apos;re satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you get a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the in@@ verse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation . even in this case you can look at them . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ strength / contrast / gamma is the tool to improve exposure . even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool , you need for the purposes only in the field of sliding . concrete the three sl@@ anders below the hist@@ o@@ program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or of selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sl@@ ur@@ ers are clicked on into it and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to use it is to move the controller and take care of it , as the picture changes .
on the right hand you can view the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is dominated by linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . images of a digital camera is often dominated by linear hist@@ ogram . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic setting is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle of the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , commonly called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic calibration .
output : the output values permit the selection manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators used to change the output values . for example , the compression of output values can be used . for example , the compression of output values can be used as a background while something else is visible in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and Laden : these buttons can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded again . in addition , the Gimp level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color p@@ all@@ ets , the inputs are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and solar tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original image to set the hist@@ ogram program for red , green , blue and lumin@@ esc@@ ence channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final outcome .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify which is altered by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols can be changed between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded using a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful . in this case , the linear mode helps a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a tur@@ pa@@ x for the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones can be corresponding with dar@@ ker cut@@ outs and the image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos a red mark is visible . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , is a suitable line on this line . create a dot on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and charging : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve that you can have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gimp Short format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the turn , middle and solar tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant canal . shadow and sun tones were applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the color@@ ings of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you look at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison to its own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you place it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to indicate the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction will allow you to change this picture . if you are able to keep the image , the channel bl@@ ender will be able to create the image of great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes visible to a visible noise caused by far@@ brau@@ schen . if that is the case you can easily improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so that you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first in each channel .
save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can save you later and then load . that used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the painted picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step , since color images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film roller profiles .

Grün@@ er : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scenarios and p@@ ushes especially good to portraits against heaven . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
or@@ ang@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ ang@@ ter .
rot@@ filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic ascen@@ sion effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar f@@ ow@@ ls at the time period . thus , similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones in the shadow of the shadow . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture of image processing can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and this changed under ( 2 ) . relief is set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative setting to add a picture .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task . to keep his attention it is a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier for the h@@ iring eye . under the frame , the module can be started using the image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired cream type for your image . through a colored line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it leaves it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is larger with the frame and the original figure will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also depends on multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply specify text , orientation , color from color space and character set with its qualities as you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
each setting you select for your text can be changed before you press &quot; OK &quot; button . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; insert templates , you can insert a template on a painting .
the menu image template applied in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture .
for sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; simply send us an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folders in which you have copied the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for sten@@ cils has been added , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of sten@@ cil printer . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button reduces the underlying picture below . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , check the picture correspon@@ d@@ ingly smaller . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; offers three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
def@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Winston Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the dig@@ iti@@ zation process colors with only minimum differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when colours are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequent attachment as normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , frequently a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing has been applied . images in the raw format , however , must always be po@@ orer during processing .
some scanners apply a hot filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by using a photo using the shar@@ pen@@ ing advertising suit . that can be correct with the menu entry .
but they should be careful , however , because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enh@@ ances the rust@@ le . in general , you can adjust it via the menu entry . you can focus on the menu entry . under Re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to adjust the image a bit soft , is much simpler than using the menu entry . use the tool for sof@@ ter with the menu entry . the thumb@@ nail on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ise is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview can help edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the def@@ ici@@ fe mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are generated near sharp edges .
the radius is showing how many pixels are affected on each side of a se@@ wer by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ators . therefore , they should be best shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ver@@ itable picture which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
the swelling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this way you can use a minimal difference in order to avoid a se@@ wer of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft switching between the pl@@ ush and hence the beauty error in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surface is avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ cot filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing re@@ focuses on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to reverse a picture &amp; quot ; this is better approach than trying to shar@@ k . this is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . you can start using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . you can start using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . you can start using the same technique by using color re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ ender works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . this mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ eln , which is far influenced by the original qu@@ el pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse is affected in most cases even very strongly from remote pixels . it causes undes@@ irable results .
circular hook : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most images the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp then should pay attention to icons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filters can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the filter can assume values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still increase the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filters .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . however , that the module may produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any prec@@ inct parameters will be set to you , that will be stored for later and can be loaded then .
try out all enco@@ res , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much surg@@ eries are not immediately visible , but leave later uncertain arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ms produce better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically speaking , un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ting must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of infin@@ ity . for the Wiener filter it can never be at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better at processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different fil@@ tering , on a small non @-@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is attri@@ but@@ able to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for further information on the method@@ ology in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator p@@ ains the def@@ sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dar@@ ken@@ ed to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the tin@@ plate allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark eyes , then you can adjust it here .
the Tool Image correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different settings as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can also use the tab and advanced settings .
detail @-@ maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even homogen@@ ous regions smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should be given so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be ordered retro@@ actively . please note that the detailed post@@ ure always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the correc@@ t@@ ness .
direction ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth evenly throughout all directions , while a value is near to 1 just in one direction . if you have a high value of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are given best in a value near 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor via all@@ es@@ . p then define the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , use this value for the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is related to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is exposed , because it is difficult to appreciate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm will go through . usually , 1 or 2 is normally enough .
angle progress da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is cho@@ osen too small , it should also be chosen too small . make sure that small angles do a long term . so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ r@@ ale step span &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ r@@ ational stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smo@@ othing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more about quality you will receive by selecting this option is only low . but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button departure .
below you can see how image errors have been removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is taken on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage that the original image has been caused under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lo@@ wering is a very powerful tool to reduce image rob@@ es . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ations from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of made images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
pictured above shows a typical scene that was taken with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ins of noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ window settings can remain at the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can shift the picture above the picture and the color in it gets gl@@ az@@ ed and there@@ with smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge of the filter . this value sets the pixel pitch into place . if it is increased , smokers can adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or dirt takes place again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or smokers can occur . if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts , you want to lose without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ation tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the int@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more pot@@ able to increase . however , it also contam@@ inated the sha@@ dow@@ y areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ ding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , r@@ ushing and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . he can remove prey and is the recommended method for this .
save under and Laden : these buttons are used exactly to this . all parameters for reducing the lo@@ wering that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) . the pre@@ reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to diff@@ use the image a bit soft , is fortunately much simpler than a picture to shar@@ k . use this tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry . the thumb@@ nail on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Photo Rest@@ au@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ ac@@ ts@@ .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s , film licensed , scrat@@ ches , compression , compression , and local errors as well as the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ turing is done with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ i and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduces : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it produces some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; - small standards that are visible in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . so , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
down below , you can reduce your photo with a smooth rob@@ ber@@ y . the module is used on a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that has been viewed using a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ Lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that were protected by a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression may have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will display automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark picture to the correct picture . please note that the Wiz@@ ard is re@@ viewing the last dark picture and automatically re@@ charges this in the next session .
the image area and preview help you correct the result . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all locations .
select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : there is an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be used to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . they are then used to pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are preferred to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to interv@@ ene in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to charge a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to interv@@ ene in block pixel .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel @-@ Cor@@ rection on a color picture , taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ion correction is a tool for correct the fitting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lens , especially in the middle and large photo format , can frequently light up the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by allowing the light to reduce the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ facts show this behavior also .
but it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ Filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should use , also with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise imp@@ air effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and grey f@@ uses of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ animal measure turns the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ um correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of biggest density the filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , which means an optical filter with a blade setting of 2 , ent@@ sp@@ richt@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ port , reduce it to a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ starch , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ um correction reduces the illumin@@ ation of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want to add a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the target image , you can set the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gamma @-@ zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ um correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the original image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lamp and contra@@ ction correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but laugh at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the body @-@ efficient Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second ridge . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ed @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values ho@@ ver@@ ted dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ ortion . this value counter@@ acts strongly to the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners Parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter general .
zoom : this value scale the image size and thereby carries a correction first degree through . negative values may enlarge the picture .
bright : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values increase .
to help you find the best fil@@ tering settings , illustrated in the dialog with a preview of Pro@@ jec@@ ting correction . the values you use for your picture will be saved and the next start@@ up is used as default values .
the ton@@ n@@ - or ho@@ ver@@ ic correction should be done before all enco@@ res or size changes . preferably , you perform this correction as all of the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then carry out a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction you can find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . afterwards , you can fix the ton@@ n@@ - / ver@@ craft @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you correct a ho@@ ver@@ tible dist@@ ortion , the resulting image black corners will be removed . you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu . you can remove this slide from the image processing or using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zoom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for most pictures the ton@@ sil@@ ly correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , is to correct all angles in the image of 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ sil@@ ly correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ e.@@ org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can adjust two parameters of screening and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ators may sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ins texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changed the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows will white as snow !
since the filter colour channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information are missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ mic filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter filmmaker is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce movies on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance sensitivity of the films .
the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , the view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the body . if you need more gra@@ ins to ISO @-@ 2400 if you need more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the screening effect on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that used ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity was ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and style are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper chooses the brush size between one and five out . th@@ icker brush are better for large pictures . smo@@ othing controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing size is marked with the ( 2 ) image size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth . 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and int@@ ran@@ t@@ ness gra@@ dients . the lines whose gra@@ dient is slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would have good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a range of 1 to 100 in order to control this effect . the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the charcoal vent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filters engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important on content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ umental landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by dist@@ orted effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by acu@@ ity effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Im@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along st@@ ern@@ ing lines going out of a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by rotating the pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ balance of a turning camera .
distance : wi@@ pes the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal mot@@ ions of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photo shooting , camera .
turn@@ key un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image soft to the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and subtle glow .
Schüt@@ t @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by random shift in pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ balance of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent imp@@ etus : finds the color p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice small tool for doing ra@@ ind@@ rops to your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a great look . it uses a protected algorithm to use Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows you to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the size of the image is not used automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size of the drops . the number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of the dro@@ pl@@ ets on the image .
you can choose between &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is free of shelves . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you start the filter , the area will remain free of shelves .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops fil@@ tering . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it through mirrors or rotating in the right direction . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers rotating or transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you invent a picture and how can you invent a picture ? how can you invent the missing information ? how can you invent the missing information ? how can you invent the missing information here ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm can be used here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size using the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target value . the dialog is to be seen below .
to change the size , a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
maintain the aspect ratio : if enabled , the size of the size is retained when setting up the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is related to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is exposed , because it is difficult to appreciate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ key effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as well as loading will be used exactly . any adjustment for photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast on what it does , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
you can see an example of the photo bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly used operation , but also a often under@@ rated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pick up the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you are moving the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview as your photo after cutting @-@ cutting area . you can change the size of the cut area by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle can be created by using the left mouse button .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the random icon , use the button The Add @-@ button of image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file save or save file in the menu to save the newly added picture .
in the scope of view , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool to cut aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the format , the larger value of height and in the landscape is always assigned .
the tool fits according to aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , inc@@ ur or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
down in the dialog , you can set the Max . ratio button to cut on the maximum possible mode , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation , place .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the default values , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected and not the original image .
the settings of assem@@ bling aid allows you to bl@@ end Help , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ical divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ term rule , harmon@@ ical triangles are a possibility to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangle .
golden centre : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that usually follows is considered visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you comp@@ ose a picture . these ai@@ ds are mentioned below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ term rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition is the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flux . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to produce the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be in the focal point of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be simply because of being without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ triangles are also derived from the above mentioned golden spiral . in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not a uni@@ an@@ gled triangle . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can place a static object dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame in order to place your frame of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Horizont@@ al mirror reflect and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic stages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are shot at an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose the Free rotation and adjust the target range .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
to help your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line to position the two lines . after you move it on an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transformation process cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . however , consider the above warning .
all per@@ spective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ calculated . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new heights : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed District .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed district .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to det@@ ach this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
this tool is used to shift part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no turning , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Transform@@ ers Sch@@ eren .
push your image by using horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will appear to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right .
to help your help become a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the line tool to adjust the image .
after having conducted the she@@ ar , the picture will get caught a bit . for a single donation , this effect is usually neglected , but two s@@ words produced twice as much as devast@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after placing the picture , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , they will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats that knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can find this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ plug ; accepted . in section configuration you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras do not allow you to use this format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression method on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also freely store when this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image Converter of &amp; digi@@ plug . in section configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; her@@ eby you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are provided by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are frequently saved in the avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ Format ; but it is not a film processing program and has no built @-@ in options . &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings are used to play movies to play the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module has a series of images exported into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the module Bel@@ ow .
many tools you need the photo processing in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description is here .
all image processing tools like shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise supp@@ ress , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a unified di@@ alog@@ y , indic@@ ating the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you &amp; quot ; texture gover@@ ning quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the fo@@ res@@ area . these modes are :
vertical and without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected fo@@ amer .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area displays the original and lower comparison to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the court and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show Over@@ - and Under@@ cover . those used colors can be adjusted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can pull this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the picture , from which you want to preview the preview . a preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all inser@@ tion from the final use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider makes an intuitive map search available based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move up a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , your images are stored in Ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . application can be used to edit color p@@ all@@ ets and choose and use colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and Zul@@ u @-@ used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets , or search the folder on files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color . colour is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor , then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box F@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted in the color panel on the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes any other ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check@@ box over@@ writing under the B@@ sor button .
a selection that created so produced as described in the last section , can be used with copying , crop and paste .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a row @-@ end character if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; inserted .

&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are used in science , especially in computer science . the programs that includes graph@@ s are designed &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few features .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s are re@@ calculated and graphic viewer ; representing )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open the graph@@ s in &amp; graphic viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than this no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires &amp; graphic ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s required . in detail are required :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in an own sub@@ window . at first , if you &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without any argument , the tool bar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list Zul@@ u opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview will appear in the corner when the graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed location of this overview or select this position automatically .
use mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right in pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graphic viewer ; loaded file has changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change the change , so that later , you can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings ; see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; com@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or want to display the instance shown in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanent , but you can change it with the setup dialog .
when program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be on this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site once again gives the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph will open outside a current session . you can specify a standard behaviour for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is in demand .
the site seats option gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine how to be asked for every start .
the context menu , which usually appears in a single click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; offers additional options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms choose . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a spare file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that have been included in the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , the coordinates are carried out in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera data must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera ness . is the devi@@ ation below which data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate to all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality , location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is located , you can put this limits here and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialogue can use the coordinates using a call to the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and increase it . in addition , choose the region concerned and increase it . you must always be selected again until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be manually changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to app@@ end GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML @-@ pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded using UTF @-@ 8 encoding to facilitate the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows all the albums to choose from . on the right hand you will need to select this albums . with the three buttons on the right hand you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab has also been created to create a gallery in each image too . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will display directly with your screen viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . choose a folder where you can write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will be stored in the new pictures .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider thumb@@ nails allow you some of the settings from the album rider for thumb@@ nails , which are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user as far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has generated pages , the window doesn &apos;t automatically shut down . you can therefore read the programs in order to see if error occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched to display the preview of the gallery . press closing around the module .

this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG coding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG coding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select the DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the disc DVD / XV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures you have to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start the module with Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be chosen from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
the next step you should specify a picture in seconds . the speed of image transfer is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set up next . in doubt you should set them black . you can choose the name and path of the generated file , under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension if possible .
in case you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can drink a coffee quickly or in all the rest of your computer , and enjoy the slides , if you are back again .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings bottom .
the printer wizard allows several images to print on a sheet of paper . the combined images can also be printed automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is , for example , to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . original version of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conver@@ sions process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings will be used for the white comparison . the key parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion may be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can save one of the three output formats and save the conversion outcome . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you have preferred to process your images , or you will not be able to use the JPEG format because it only permits a limited number of operations before the picture quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are more adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it again .
the stac@@ king processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . if you are sure , for example , by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single pictures . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write an existing file . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview of progress is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to start the grid and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the item . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the image size from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge . these are four types of picture change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , chosen . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image size .
proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
printing preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background colour , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images added . more images can be drawn to the list of images added and down there .
after starting the module , the images window will be displayed with you from pre @-@ elected images . add a picture to the selected images . for the last selected image , a preview on the right @-@ hand side will be displayed .
you can also pull images onto the picture list and add there to add a list of images to sen@@ tim@@ ed images .
the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be removed .
after you have selected all pictures , you can open the button OK with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected from you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not mind too many images at one time . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a modified file , the comments are joined in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the ver@@ los@@ s@@ less formats like T@@ IF@@ F . they should therefore use P@@ NG whenever you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ ications details will be added to sen@@ tim@@ ed images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down , in search of errors , you can view . your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button Close you can sch@@ lie this window ? en .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have your slides . you can select here between the selected and all images of the album .
Open@@ GL is the option to use Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation , using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the file name is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the S@@ loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . then you can manually stop using Es@@ c .
the option images randomly select that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
delays between the pictures can be set at the time interval between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds equals 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should make it out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random if you choose between images a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slides .
on the left screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the full number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module period currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. At@@ ten@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English .

before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be shown on the viewing page . check out information about the export files you &apos;ll find in .
last@@ ly , you can select what information can be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , all images are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting so that you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain views .
in this area you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most adjustment possibilities are unique , so that it is not specifically addressed .
below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . by this , those need to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no more pictures download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if it wants to see a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , you specify the different folder and URL where your website is stored .
at best choose a basic folder for all of your HTML files , and each subsequent proposition is a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the main folders in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and next time you can specify a folder , or a folder with a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they are all displayed for viewing . if you select any URL , after the pages have been created , the URL that you can define here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files created by you will not have to copy them manually . so that the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folders in which all sub@@ folders .
the just described setting options have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will set , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; che@@ Photo@@ album ; you may need to use a HTML page for viewing the pictures , you may need to use a HTML page for viewing the images , reception location , etc . , you must do with &amp; che@@ photo album ; you do not even have this job again .
with &amp; Photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it , whether the images are stored in the file or whether you can put all images into the file . the advantage of all images into the file can be stored so independently . however , this obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can import a .@@ k@@ im file from the menu Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , it will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches for the pictures , which are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file , the images of the URL , which you have specified in creating the HTML files , this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via the HTML export .
in the following , dialogue for exp@@ orting images will be described , which you can export about the &quot; Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to deal with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
if you have to copy Manu@@ ally near the .@@ k@@ im file you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy the Autom@@ atically into the .@@ k@@ im file to copy and copy your photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures already have been compressed with JPEG image and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want this , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is Maxim@@ ale image size . if you want to send images to your friends , you might want to limit the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , for example , you can limit the size by using the maximum of 800 pixels high and its size .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu , select your photo album ; the exported database is described as described in .
the Wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing is made of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you person@@ ified the category individuals of the saved file person@@ er ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called in your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window which are to be imported into the third dialog boxes and which categories will match these in your database .
in the fourth step you can get the categories of import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example for this you can see on the picture .
it must be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you see images , you often want to watch images within different picture groups and watch m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and view , go to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images . but it has been extended and now also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about images , but often they also include videos .
&amp; Photo@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice , i.e. , Normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want them .
&amp; Photo@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and used to record them in future starts . if you want to read another database with images , you can start &amp; che@@ photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up in a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; Photo@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained .
on the left you can view six different symbols , with which you can view the pre@@ viewing options and options for viewing . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it has been described to you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums .
please see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle class as declared .
in view the setting options available , which you want to set up the list of members . in the list , select the category which you want to configure . in the left window of the list , a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his mod@@ ulation system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . please click on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be called by the modules . the modules can be read and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call through the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together with several applications , it can be tested that the modules have been tested with &amp; a photo@@ album ; therefore , you should use new modules first with the demo database before using the command &gt; Photo@@ photo@@ album Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which is also able to use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order doesn &apos;t support the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; che@@ photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album &amp; play@@ photo album , the modules have to pass a list of albums . this is a photo album and a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; drop photo@@ album ; s brows@@ ing the contents of a category , for example , each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you use the category individuals , so do if you have chosen people to view and share this on the module .
since some modules are installed with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can remove these from the list of modules . then start the settings dialog , and select the modules that modules should be loaded .
on the picture you will see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; che@@ photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to see it from any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see the window with which you have entered the picture above . at the moment , you will not see any information about your images . in the section , you will not see any information about your images . in the section , you will not see any information about your images . in this section , please click on the picture gallery , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with remarks . this includes information about the people taken on the picture , where the image has been taken either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if shown on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were taken .
all these comments can be used for searching and brows@@ ing as you can read in section . if you want to see these notes , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists using a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; che@@ Photo@@ album ; as you can always use it again when you enter information about your pictures .
following idea is based on the shifting of images within the list : if you are for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures , the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , so that the names used to be moved up above are able to find them faster and assign .
if you prefer a alpha@@ be@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting off date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ation for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the preview of the image right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , recorded then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture , you see a browser window that shows the US as a group . in order to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the dialog box , it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new over@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry into a category and place there in order to sort this entry into an sub@@ category . please note that you just sort your categories in alpha@@ be@@ tically . see .
you can post@@ p@@ one the elements of the feature , by selecting the glue , which make the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make your own window by pulling him out of the window areas .
if you have adapted the look at the window so attached to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and layout of the window .
you can also show up a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then click on the window . see this in the picture below .
if you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or any images if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can view the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down@@ wards pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
if you leave a picture on your desktop background , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to er@@ ase and press in the Edit menu . now the window is shown you can see in the picture .
&amp; drop photo album ; you can use a solution for this problem . you can also use your photo album . you can also use images anywhere you have stored on the hard disk . in the image you need to record the images somewhere , so you can download the pictures from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , this is available for pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nail images are available . however , the preview of these pictures can be displayed . however , you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy them from the folders and copy them again . if you want to avoid trouble if you want to avoid the merge of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the menu Pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy you want to filter out the pictures so that you may see for others un@@ accessible in the menu . alternatively , you may also view all the images that your little sister may see , cont@@ ests and select the menu entry All out of current view .
this allows you to specify which pictures are hidden in the case of the case . if you have to shut the images in the case of your little sister , simply select the pictures you have blocked , hidden . if you want to see the pictures you want to be hidden , click on the lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to unlock the images . to configure this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one you can read or delete all images on the disk and to others , the password as un@@ encrypted text can be read out or delete . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; che@@ photo album ; not very familiar with view to private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; che@@ Photo@@ album ; you manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview them from the preview as described in .
the viewer you can see in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you &apos;ve made about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure it with the mouse and then you can also configure which information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . that will be shown below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on this page , see , matching entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene , as if you were chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can use them before and back by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded on the viewer , you can run this as slide show . &amp; drop a new picture after a few seconds . as often a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus the button C@@ trl with the key C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful skill of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and return .
if you can use the viewer in the picture and zoom out . you can zoom out the mouse into the picture . with the minus button you can zoom out the Plus @-@ button in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed , so the zo@@ oms sets the zo@@ oms so that every pixel sets the screen to a pixel of the image .
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations working with videos that are in and extrac@@ ting with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the screen@@ functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the picture open to insert this name . however , you may prefer to check out the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to see the images on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and check it as good or bad as you watch one by one .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer &apos;s possibility to display images with features , while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature that you have the appropriate letters . in view , see a picture with which features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have selected all the pictures you have to edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail view . if you view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply press the character to the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you can use your photo album ; painting your photo album .
the painted is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your Gem@@ old later .
in the picture , you can see a picture on the painted screen . to turn on the painting by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in order to turn on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; col@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely domin@@ ate but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ image views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object object already selected , as all sub@@ items are already selected with the object .
to add a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object , or click on the icon in tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are any possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be inserted , so that you can choose the right position :
delete either from the menu bar , under the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have properties change , click on the user to adopt these changes . have you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description , and then click on application or reject the changes with dis@@ rup@@ tions .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you process a texture or texture of a texture , you can see a preview of your self @-@ view .
press a preview of the self @-@ definition view and a small example of the scene is rendered using the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture will be selected ( for example a texture within a texture @-@ map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through drag and mouse within the whole window .
each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level property or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Vis@@ i@@ bility level is smaller or equal in the tool bar chosen .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store several window direc@@ tives and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the temptation to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the temptation to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the temptation in the midst of a different view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map tape in the views above .
the last possible window rules are floating views : views which are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the temptation to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the Anf@@ al bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for each type of views . new views are nar@@ rowing , you can anchor on any spot .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have generated a scene , you can render them . &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render this program has to be installed correctly . this version is written in &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in Tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a grid mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; S ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can store any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images in highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The R@@ ender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; icon in the tool bar , or select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu , the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot;
any root mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the donated picture . if you only want to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to render into input fields .
in combination quality you can select the features that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the ration@@ ales can be found in the user hand@@ book to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray pixel , different errors may occur . these images have often not displayed a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or pattern effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are displayed smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature better look better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is further divided and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion results are depending on the calculated colours .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference is calculated on a certain number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth of a certain number of pixels with super sampling , a grid of 4x4 is calculated on a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels in 4 sub @-@ pixels are shared separately , and the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted to the depth of depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of the racing is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be comp@@ uted by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams had no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; pol@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete Commander of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if in case of import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; col@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply drag the source code in the editor and drag him to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also paste .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ ounced . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the self @-@ view window , opens &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your template and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file comes in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for display of the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle in the camera @-@ view and in the window @-@ type plates .
you can adjust the object @-@ cat@@ ching of the points on the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the switches separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values provide an accurate wire model , and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detailed press for two directions .
when you cross the high detailed valu@@ ation for extended projec@@ tions , all the camera features an advanced projection screen . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall is hidden behind the objects . the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor underneath the objects are being rendered . the ground is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the shut@@ ting mode , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . you can adjust values for depth and swelling . in section R@@ ender modes you will find in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can change existing window direc@@ tives or create new window direc@@ tives . in section window direc@@ tives will explain how to create and store window direc@@ tives .
the Combin@@ ation Standard window rules : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand window direc@@ tives shows all existing window direc@@ tives . a new arrangement can be created with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with hat@@ ches you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and obli@@ que on the view does not appear in the main window , but produces a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; inst@@ alls and now you want to start with no precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can create all steps in this guide , you should enjoy the ultimate but simple scene , very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that you are using only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t have a camera , no rules for rendering users can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture .
if you have installed everything wrong , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window rules :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should know the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view from the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the results of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the object properties that find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , but please note that the camera in the view has control points , with which you can change the camera &apos;s target on one control point and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button user button or press it , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they look the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene , for example , insert a cross@@ bar ( insert end body lo@@ aders ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button User . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the plain , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you want to watch out the object tree , you will see that you can click on the object + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon , just allow you to get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to place its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment you choose something simple .
in both cases a dialog , where you can select , as the object is to be inserted . please select your first object . the pig@@ ment is then changing in the object tree . you can see the name in your self @-@ definition view ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview , as the pig@@ ment looks right now .
of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ments will only need to enter a matt black material , because you always have to enter the pig@@ ment &apos;s look at any time with a click on preview . also give you the colors to the pig@@ ment . again , there are many possibilities now , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the slide and ball in the preview , click on the button User and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the color you need . here you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board colour list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each color and change the colors in the field of object properties :
this step should already be done simply because you have the basic working mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood . the ball can be just as easy as the bottom :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the button or button users . otherwise , the ball will float above the ground , as you have moved down the ground by one unit down .
of course the rendering is now a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click &quot; Ball Pig@@ ment , then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the paste button .
the settings spl@@ end@@ or effect and reflection revealed some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have lear@@ nt so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is an R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that will render the scenes ) through the objects and how atmospheric effects are reflected in the scene , and as atmospheric effects as for example , the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye when you look at the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be lo@@ oted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual fil@@ dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already stored the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you must type a name and memory .
the scene is re@@ produced in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene .
repeat the last updated command . this menu entry may only be used , if you have used editing them .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can type a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you can find options for setting up &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation . you can change or add new commands to this option for &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to create the tool bars . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove them .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to detect rough surfaces without model@@ ing on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , using a picture file as a color card .
&amp; sn@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in your own window in size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
you can adjust , whether each picture is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the bottom window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a fitting fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return by Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue set up - &amp; ball show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working mode of &amp; sn@@ ick@@ show . in the two others , Short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keys can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . default is no full screen mode .
if this point is activated , re@@ charges &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still watch the actual picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image and is particularly suited for a slideshow .
this option holds &amp; ball @-@ show , opens the name of the last open folder . the next start@@ up opens &amp; sn@@ ick@@ show ; this folder will open in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; sn@@ ick@@ show ; so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can display the program also .
this option is extended to display the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specify if the slideshow should start with the first picture in the folder , or with the selected image .
the interval between the screen change during a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slide door and the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow can be repeated until it is canc@@ eled to the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key@@ chain for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part list of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short setting .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short setting .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short setting .
resi@@ zed the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if there is no browser window open .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; W photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; show@@ y ; is part of &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; A fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view and correc@@ tions your photos and create correc@@ tions and modifications .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ y ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user being contri@@ buting to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report any mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , your browser has a page with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out and you can simply follow the instructions to leave your notification .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you have a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; ask and hopefully see yourself questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ y ; it is the developer to join Mail@@ ing list . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ rooms ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you much control of his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to select in the menu settings ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left hand side .
in the exposure indicators , you can select the color when the sub@@ - or exposure indicator was chosen . the colors should display with what you should display , contrast . lower exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to select the selected images . you can also find these pages in the image Editing . you can see this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than pictures and p@@ ush@@ ers .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning and storing images , which no longer makes a dialog to scan and store . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving or storing the images in a specified file with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images prior to the store .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ -@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner , and press OK to open the scanner . to break off &amp; exit the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
in order to attach a picture , the user can only launch a preview can , and then scan the scan range for the final scan , the preview can be launched by the preview button .
to better choose the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the entire preview window fits in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if you select a preview on the settings , the image will appear in a preview window that is shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and lie ? en leads to a break and you will return to the main window .
by pressing the button settings the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can display the image if desired , prior to saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images store the dialog for each image open the dialog in front of each one @-@ c@@ anned picture . when &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this will automatically open with a generated name in a previously defined file , then you must select Save after a file name .
this setting defines where the images can be saved without after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as default for saving dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is beyond the proposed name for the image to store . the automatically stored picture gets recorded in a numerical suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when choosing the image quality , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings dialog shows the dialog for the settings and closing arguments to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keys @-@ short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . the global key@@ hole you can set up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and select the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts will work . thereby you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions , which are usually used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ brows@@ ers , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check your script if all required modules are available and use c@@ dialog for the user to see why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ul@@ um error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions . they will quickly realize that writing of scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be exchanged with amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages facilitate exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this way the function ex@@ ec ( ) can be used mostly . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here , an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends not@@ if@@ ications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will regularly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use .
configure We@@ is the script to view the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data each script must take care of each script . if a script is launched , Amar@@ ok sets the file folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ rating between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le - Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified , so that the script can be used to create an own entry . in order to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ il@@ p@@ ite ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove one entry again d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; when the user stops a script , or when the user stops a script , send SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storage work . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with the Extended amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main kri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily move music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a quite certain title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting brows@@ ers and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist is just right for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart playlist will automatically choose the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
normally , you have to enter the folder folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok .
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker , you should not comp@@ ile any difficulties when comp@@ iling any problems . if you encounter any problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options that can enable or disable comp@@ iling time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be fulfilled , so that they can be used . for details , see section System Re@@ qui@@ res .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should not use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; without effort you set up on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple cart@@ ridges to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player windows include the player window in addition to the playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , the play@@ lists window will be shown .
mood bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood .
voting full : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is altered .
music files can be compiled in case of music files . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser needs to be launched by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser is required .
other brows@@ ers are using : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist to save , save the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist .
relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files .
the single piece of play make visible , that the play@@ lists window will show up / off , to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context of the context , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played .
the section shows you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by marking of Own Scrip@@ tures , the otherwise gray @-@ set menu is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following areas : play@@ lists , Player window and context @-@ brows@@ ers . if you select ... , you can select a font from the select dialog .
with the selection of custom colour scheme you have the source of choice and set your own color scheme . use it with it &apos;s activated colour selection for front and background colour .
playback will continue to start playing , that &amp; Amar@@ ok . after the program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece , which it has been stopped at the last evaluation .
the An On @-@ Screen display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed , and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is font . click here to select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow ensures that the text is sha@@ ded in the O@@ SD .
our own colours use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . a click on the color selection opens onto the color selection . when used colors do not use , the default &amp; k@@ de are used .
the input text display provides the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen display is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can define on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment is to appear on the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable additional adjustment possibilities in this map .
the map collection is used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders chosen , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; according to music files . to purchase a folder in addition to its name . this section includes also check boxes for adjusting , such as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder to search for music .
modifications : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders chosen on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection files ( .@@ pl@@ s and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added playlist will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part Collec@@ ting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup will be needed in the sub@@ window MySQL device .
the MySQL device section will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using the computer screen , on which the MySQL database is located . afterwards , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use username : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the flash@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
here you enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send off pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar perform@@ ers ab@@ dic@@ ate : after activation of this setting , a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played play can be heard . note : you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need to use last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix Systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including those included programs , as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needed some of them to be found e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small manual on how to minim@@ ize c@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to prepare Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can re@@ locate the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / paste / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log and hang also the captured file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib as reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing . please report these errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer from bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is slightly more mature .
make sure that all of them have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has compiled but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the Meta @-@ Information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace to us by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in Meta @-@ Infos , but this is not as Unic@@ ode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic playlist ) can be easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bugs in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status disabled in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this adjustment shows its effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which cat@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are the easiest way by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or by developers . use this forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a bug if there is something on the limit of a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do you get music pieces there ?
that is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window into the statistic window was converted into the statistic window .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , you have to specify the evaluation column in the playlist and select the evaluation column . click anywhere in the new application column , to specify the review on a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button to select , and then select from the drop @-@ down menu .
draw a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config is missing . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ations , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras !
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used by a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is that G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conc@@ ei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and p@@ NG de@@ code !
it can be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be provided by default no MP3 decoder ( from patented legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be provided with a mixer . this can be done by a sound card using the same time and simultaneously . this can be done by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this is done so . do not forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable the sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that the sw@@ abs SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause st@@ acked playback . read this error report . read the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was greatly optim@@ ised for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound , sound system . the smaller the buffer . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , r@@ ushes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit an@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report this under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

how can one learn the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and titles of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA into the name Amar@@ ok player now@@ pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ User@@ name with your user name . this requires your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + rights mas@@ c@@ aste makes a piece in the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e . by pushing the entry into the playlist , the first search result is canc@@ eled and the search is reset .

the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need to use ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place your CD , then click on the Audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal out , select a few pieces and pull them into the desired target folders in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , remove files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece was played , the less influence has been played on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece itself by clicking with the right mouse button in play@@ lists , just like all the attributes also , by clicking on the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select App@@ endi@@ x or F2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want you to give you whenever you have a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that will not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .

with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the possibility to click Edit . that &apos;s the way to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will rise continuously , the setting for the coming pieces will be ignored . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under contemp@@ t of the play@@ able pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are kept in the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see what pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added after each split piece . if you want to set up more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side were described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , it will add Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adapt the settings by clicking the script and then click on@@ set .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the script by clicking on the script . after installing the script , a new entry in the list will be installed . you can also download new scripts directly from the internet . use the button to select a further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . then select the script to delete the script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please look forward to writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug@@ ins will be used to activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . in order to use a plug@@ in , simply enable the check box beside the name .
this quick instructions should show you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , create an audio CD . to perform the steps below , you must have a lo@@ vel@@ ed installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or any los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , you think that you can get a bad quality when adding to MP3 . you can test if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ ed format . use the au@@ c@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this quick instructions should show you how you can copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . in order to perform the steps below , you must have a lo@@ vel@@ ed installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have installed and the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an absolutely open , patented free and professional technology to audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ codes . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ gon@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . using FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ x : a program that can convert between different audio formats and can convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a full @-@ featured motor system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . this may be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and mp3 @-@ collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recordings of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect , which display the music pieces differently loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic sub@@ folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise , after a new fil@@ en@@ ame is asked .
stores the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can choose the folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you call for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project is changed and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what shall happen . you can then cancel between saving and changes . furthermore , you can break the lock and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any in@@ stored project , which should happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project will be asked what to happen if you would have called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if the current project is available straight from the top view , the current project is a data CD , the so added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is only displayed on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to import files from a previous meeting in the current session , even if this function is not used for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files available on the media already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files do not remove files from the medium , it just ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create a copy of a CD on another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also use a picture of a CD instead of normal copying . you should also prefer to copy c@@ ann@@ ons if you wish to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows editing a DVD to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a picture of a DVD with the help of copying a DVD with the help of copying a DVD with the help of copying a DVD with the help of copying a DVD with the help of copying a DVD , so the target medium must be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for a CD @-@ RW dialog . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) with which the contents will be completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between write modes and incre@@ mental .
a previously built CD image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file is currently not supported by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ on * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously built DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be fired immediately by pushing the burning button .
a previously drawn DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the contents view , but can also be used indo@@ ors . it contains information about the aus@@ ed video , encoding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the contents view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar will appear at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not attached , the status bar is hidden .
turns off the folder view into or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content will be displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locks and unlock the drive or t@@ apping of the medium .
lets the contents view a or out . the contents view allows selecting and drag files into the project view . the content view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
sh@@ uts down the head window in the project view or out . the head volume is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the head volume has no real function , it looks pretty nice and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window for modi@@ fying buttons for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adapt the key to the key below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function in effect . this dialogue is designed to person@@ alize and launch the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the K@@ d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the same thing more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the accompanying programs will give you a pre@@ ference .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two more parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ent@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ent@@ Project ( ) void of the void C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void con@@ at@@ d@@ vd ( ) void con@@ vol@@ at@@ d@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can get a project about the command line using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface , which is applicable only to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List URLs , Q@@ String parent ) void en@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void ts@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cream fol@@ k@@ bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ p / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gram@@ mes ; is an audio CD ; it can easily be read audio CDs ; it can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ e ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many co @-@ codes that support these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) as standard . other co@@ ils may still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD are read , read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ach@@ ers have already been installed , so it is highly likely to be compiled for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation will not be needed .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Code is a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to read out the audio CD ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD @-@ device can be used to avoid any cop@@ ier audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any copying of the Cop@@ ier Protection Mechan@@ isms . simply avoid buying Cop@@ ier Audio CD &apos;s software ; it is not possible to avoid the purchase of Cop@@ ier Audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the setup dialog may be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) for an understanding of the slender approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble on at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB from the Internet or can work entirely without the network , where everything is collected manually .
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main computer . on the page step by step , further information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration .
starts the CD@@ DB request from CD data to set up request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first must first be made to the Internet . )
starts out and - when a Encoder in the Co@@ di@@ fication Settings tab was set up in the set @-@ up tool - the encoding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the default . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Options tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab was configured in the Settings dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens setup dialog to configure the type of not@@ if@@ ications ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gram@@ mes , with different flash@@ cards ( like Encoder , for arran@@ ging the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ach@@ ers and compression rati@@ os , helping you in choosing the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , it &apos;s still delivered with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open licence questions
+ High until very high output quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG lightly deeper quality for deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recording devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for the music of you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ systems . but not good enough for hi@@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies and the co @-@ er@@ er@@ program to create the folder and file names and the properties of music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ach@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) to add when MP@@ 3s will be coded with l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database that can download / enter the information so that all the others can download / enter the information rather than yourself . it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the translation ) is not an attorney . however , no one can issue that you are publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither artists nor the music can be hurt by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , can be preserved anyway .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; is actively used to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( but it can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ xx ; used to use free@@ DB , the geographical server should be used at the next level . this saves bandwidth from the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of refle@@ ctions for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly generated ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that uses cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; those who want to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs ; s. to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution first if this has not happened yet .
to save the saved WAV files , the enco@@ ders and therefore the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ able comp@@ ressing for audio data ) can be added to the setup of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the co@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant lin@@ ux distribution , before the co@@ ach@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a code , further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame @-@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check out the device number of the device number of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to retri@@ eve both programs with a command line in one terminal . this might give a reference to what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a step by step @-@ by @-@ step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe to do anything ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read about MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case it is not necessary to comp@@ ile a search engine . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ aming about it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies ; something which is thought to be done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any read &amp; CD .
here we determine the de@@ compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . if we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them in any out@@ reading of a &amp; CD ; once the matching settings are found .
the device designation is delivered to the program reading , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or when more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ rod and an attempt with the there available entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the map of general settings . here you do not get much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be loaded / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen photo .
only if in@@ appropriate information can be requested , so that you will be informed when information about the witness of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card box CD ; simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically can be downloaded via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while using the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection range is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; associated with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , can be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you can use free@@ DB locally in the offline mode , if you want to download the database before . however , if you want to use the database before . however , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first one . mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data @-@ en@@ quiry , for retri@@ eving &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system learn how to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . use everything as shown in the screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror @-@ server near you . on this path the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server as though , as many fire@@ walls date the protocol 88@@ 80 def@@ aults , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transfer and transfer data to the free@@ DB server . the first check box should turn off .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your machine )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this , then / must be specified in which the WAV files can be specified . if only space is available on another drive , the files will not be checked in the private folder . don &apos;t forget it if you want to make this folder with WAV files .
all so enter as it is on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something has to be blind@@ ed to the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo equipment . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be er@@ ased in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously .
this is , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens . this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music wise , you never have to change them again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure is described and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from free@@ DB to pick up . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any in@@ conclu@@ sive &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , displays the screen photos a bit differently than that for a &amp; CD ; you &apos;ll learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of retri@@ eve them from the web . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; identi@@ fies and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , search for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are also displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database record that your opinion matches best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query from free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually release this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo , the title of the piece in the first line of the &quot; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must not be entered in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ac@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editors , so that you are not only starting with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the comm@@ ent@@ ment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies ; this option is set up in the section encoding settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co @-@ makers and file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ ers to get more information .
simply select an entry , which is obviously in@@ accurate with the style of the chosen CD ; this is not important , since we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p to find below Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the book &apos;s items . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typ@@ ed all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed over the piece .
note that it has a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button All pieces select at the lower edge of the screen to select all the pieces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the button select the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message lets you see if you are trying to work with a di@@ pole you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this allows to read out and coding parallel . please note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program is not found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able to sub@@ mis@@ use this behavior is un@@ clear . the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers is . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; is now maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; you can also download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions do already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gram@@ s. is part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at persons who comp@@ ile from source files , and not intended for users who use the pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different other programs , has many variants of settings . at best , read the step by step for the options and settings . it displays photos of the different flash@@ cards of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first time of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from an unusually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably the program has started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens , may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has this section and must therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange if you have succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need those information , but ...
&amp; C@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides other , it has some features , including real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ line emphasis on texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; C@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it works on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS @-@ and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projector , which is supported for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is supported , as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel by emphasis of pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; kiss each MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; finish in the game of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song for the next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu . it appears the usual file @-@ dialog , with which help you choose the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also work with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry slot from the menu or create the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then play one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button , and drive with the regulator .
when you find that a song is too fast or slowly playing , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the temp@@ o Display , and so you can change the speed of the temp@@ . to re @-@ click the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or select the menu entry in the menu , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . enter the space bar while not playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in a music piece . some pieces use text install@@ ment , others use lyrics , others use lyrics . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; C@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined to set up a song , so you &apos;ll need to manually setup the Karaoke text , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , select the entries text and lyrics . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that allows you to summar@@ ize . this section shows how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the point organization .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the preferred footprint in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song in the collection manager . in turn , the file dialog appears where you can choose the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the option auto add to the collection .
if automatic adding is added to the collection , a piece can be added to the active collection by opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied at opening . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on them .
you can select the sequence in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu game sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select any random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the Karaoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow right .
to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the record previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection box and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are non @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of the Type Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file of your hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece of play .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . the requirement for that is a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that one section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can be in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are non @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM Pat@@ ches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all tones that use this instrument ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a ri@@ f@@ le supplement . to do this , you can do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so , if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( fabric shooting ) it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , with which each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and does not represent the pitch of the tone of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keyboards for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form sound on the Per@@ kus@@ hima channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to ex@@ changing the first and second channel , simply make it easy to use in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , assembled according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is used on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must of course be defined forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the us@@ sion@@ ist patch on the Per@@ kus@@ hima channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ et@@ R@@ atio in which relation to Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der &apos;s events will be multiplied by it . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der Event with the value n , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make no dec@@ imal definitive in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM exists that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch tool with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards do not need to play higher on your keyboard . in order to get the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ atures , you see what sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t display green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( now ) has two different views to display the played notes . view the Settings menu under the Point Can@@ al@@ view : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD displays the speed on which a song is played , the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the speed , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , such as a music piece has to be played . it contains the same MIDI file to perform very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have it done , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agreed that it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
before you check the option auto add to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to a temporary collection .
you can double the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ pin LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop an &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I want to play a file ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or play a file , only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; change the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding it to a collection , turn the option Automatic Add to collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection added by files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . just want to play the first file only . so , if you want to add automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this an MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or the postcard , encourage me to program further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I have not much time to take for my hobbies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , a bug or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge delight , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to receive a MIDI file , then you should contact me when I may have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; I have completely written down in my spare time and I &apos;ll point out that I am only going to program@@ er because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for the testing of the AW@@ E support , Mr. P@@ etter Bie@@ ker , Mr. Ulrich Cor@@ der and anyone who sent me a patch , error not@@ if@@ ications , or just a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these superb musicians on the net which give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; C@@ mid can also be found ; also on his homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development and look at the pictures . you will find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it will run as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet over as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ sel@@ ectable windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if there is information in it .
it is possible to select the preferred connections below the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy stage . if you find an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the arranged entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct the editing of XML configuration files . of course , one can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , there@@ from the menu view and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode or a different group is selected without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and loading can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ able and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ server option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the start does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through opening another source . however , this would end at the end of animation , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; body@@ building ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ building ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory / some examples of S@@ MIL the of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported .
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player to configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here , the edition of m@@ player is evident .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ app@@ ra@@ dec mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages it is necessary to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog box of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is well known in a consoles and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a pre @-@ given baking for a particular M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , this will be used to use the used device and the TV channels . this can be used manually from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) the dialog in the k@@ m@@ player is to use the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be selected ( for example , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB package .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video devices ( probably the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension works for the X server . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it is necessary to include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentary , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , t@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ ées , t@@ v@@ ées , source @-@ source , source @-@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
can there be hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom drive onto the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts up slowly but why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , but the first time will examine x@@ ine the CPU .

QT ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes a comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably on the package &amp; tex@@ tional ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; col@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable an easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are on the c@@ ile ; web page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; , &amp; &amp; Linux ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users can hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is considered . if the support for this project or documentation is requested , the contact via the k@@ ile should be made .
ask questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; col@@ ile ; on or if extensions is desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list c@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; hurry ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tail@@ or @-@ made access within the source code as well as conversion and viewing tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn about Kate , the Hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start working directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right way to use : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH . if it is easy to use , it can also use a lo@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also a less demanding but realistic yields , it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here &apos;s only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be able . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
similarly as other characteristic languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alization features such as paper format , page images and text fragments will begin with the command \ \ &apos; document@@ class , the entrance begins with the command \ \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Schnell@@ start @-@ Wiz@@ ard of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a powerful feature for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ zel ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : this will be the type of document being generated : articles ( article ) , book &#91; Book &#93; , Letter &#91; Report &#93; , Articles &#91; Report &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ Book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; leaf@@ s &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is set to use the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if UTF @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration they only have to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( with compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find out with the creation of German text .
new users therefore don &apos;t worry about it . it is a brief description of the functions and further information to be added in the section .
&amp; hurry ; offers - as well as other source text editors , the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; col@@ ile ; you should have a simple problem solving , however , that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will be saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will be saved by the emphasis of time and time .
by entering a new command , the automatic command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ &apos; command } ) is created by &amp; col@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line ( for example \ \ to { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into a few elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; in@@ curr@@ ing the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ du@@ ous element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , single elements can be changed through a mouse click on the relevant settings .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful if you have a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; of the same file &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is available in PDF to the simple output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ Files for different systems and bars .
when using the rack @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on an item in DVI ; -@@ file was clicked on an item in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was clicked on . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was clicked , the corresponding site is executed in DVI ; viewing .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used with multiple files . using a Master document , working with other embedded .@@ tex files will be simplified using the project . using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick structure : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file access : in this mode , the DVI cable -@@ file is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ file &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the quick assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at the Edit tool bar , the three large numbers should be used for the rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first selection range is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection range further is available for items such as tags , joints , or references . the available toll options are :
designation : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( sel@@ ective selection ) .
when using quote , a list of sel@@ ections is displayed with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are necessary Edit@@ ors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; col@@ ile ; by hand .
the last sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ n@@ ā is used for defin@@ ing the font name . it can be set up for the main text , the share of joints , etc . , the following font names are available :
when calling &amp; col@@ ile ; two selection options are available for publication : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and set of settings . 2 . the document can be written down by reason .
the brackets in accordance with the command \ \ &apos; folder class set the settings for command . ( 12@@ pt &#93; ) defines the font . if the font has been set up , it can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the building and the button of bone .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; will automatically remove the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched for errors . when using quick assembly &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log should also be considered .
an area ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font names have been created . the command \ \ \ , { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ the { environment } needs to be found in the environment .
the result is only valid within the environment ( from \ \ ) to { environment } up to \ \ , { environment } . there is no coating ( number ) for public de@@ preci@@ ation within a environment .
there are many ways to view the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , it can be added certain fon@@ ts , grease , ital@@ ic pressure , under@@ lining , etc . , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; always { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive strength and is long as long as it is closed , until it is closed with a \ \ to { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . quot@@ ation begins with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ to { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language is represented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; col@@ ile ; .
once in the wizard a little text has been entered , a few custom@@ ization for the better reading of the document should be completed . a quot@@ ation , a few spots in the fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to the editor via Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl ( with an external viewer ) . from an external viewer , the window has to be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document may print out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a remote file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conversion or computer imaging .
to print a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document using the print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly set ) .
the tool bar is capable of converting DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion may start in the tool bar in the tool bar .
the priority claim to meet the direct jump from the editor to an open position within DVI ; file .
&amp; hurry ; offers a corresponding attitude for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . this only needs to set up Modern unter Settings K@@ ile ... tools for building @-@ balanced .
to locate the stock search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source code and click on advance search . the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI ; viewer will then be carried out .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex file in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; c@@ ile ; open and set to the appropriate lines . this text must be set as text editor ( Settings ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
should using quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be able to reveal a bug . if an error occurs , it will be shown in the log file , or in the message window .
the logging file contains the error source in source code . in the editor , the buttons will always appear on the error in which the error appears . in order to see the incorrect line , the error message must be clicked on the error , and &amp; col@@ ile ; jumps to the incorrect line .
once clicked on the corresponding button in the tool bar , a window to select the template appears for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document may either be re@@ written or re@@ written to the quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
controlled users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document easier .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file has to be created or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template by offering an existing document and selection of File presentation .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some string labels will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings .
in creating the own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is subst@@ it@@ uted by entering the document class . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the help of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , its own template instead of the standard must be balanced .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be created a simple way to create a template , should be searched one in the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers to read and emphasis on many different types of text files ( including also lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many edit@@ ings for &amp; Kate ; can be done directly in the menu .
to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and to learn about Kate , the Hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; hurry , can get there directly with reading the chapter of &amp; Kate .
&amp; hurry ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a useful description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; you can find them as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with button@@ ter C@@ trl key to extract the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ has been selected for \ \ or \ \ any .
when pulling the text with a painted lin@@ ker button , the chosen text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated conversion , parts of the source code will be selected in the editor window .
&amp; hurry ; has the ability to browse the different types of source codes and empha@@ size them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants can include ski jump plac@@ ements . this is a separate type of bookmark within the text . this ski stamp is empha@@ sized , so that this ski stamp is highlighted so that it will automatically be used in the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions are added in &amp; Cau@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source codes are added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Adv@@ ices , the following commands are included :
will have a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not included in this text , such as tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only in@@ ventive cause in &amp; col@@ ile ; is thus that the sum of the text is separated by two empty lines .
if the word is under the current cur@@ sor position . this choice also has an extended meaning , since this command is also possible &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands to an extra star ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
to listen to a part of the document may be removed naturally and by pressing the key Ent@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the key signature C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . under editing are the following commands to remove the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; col@@ ile ; is included in the description to do installation .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; hurry ; add more commands to edit environment for a fine , simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to join the close .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ &apos; environment } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many sh@@ attered environment commands , this command can quickly become lost . this command includes the last open environment , so that the revers@@ ing of the ambient conditions will not be destroyed .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ x Group are a few key commands that correspond to the editing environment .
this command is spec@@ kled in the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the resulting cl@@ amp .
this command is spec@@ kled in the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clas@@ p .
if the cur@@ sor is cur@@ ated before or behind the h@@ ul@@ led cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; Group # , will be inj@@ ected at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many welded groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be quickly lost to the view . this command complet@@ es the last open group , so that the dis@@ ach@@ ute structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy inser@@ tion signs are used in &amp; col@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two easy inser@@ tion signs . &quot; &amp; hurry ; know this case and for two close mounting signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic add @-@ up of the double click mark can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will come out .
there are also possible settings ( for example , n@@ german or French ) and so German or French host@@ names are used . there are also many other languages available .
during the shift of Shift ; input &amp; c@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a row change but also the command \ \ item .
within a T@@ ables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ has a close closing time .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to empha@@ size the default &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . set up these can be added to Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users can assign the columns to tables and thereby re@@ arrange all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) to each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not the door to be added ; however , this tab@@ ulator is not the added , for the columns of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; it has already been a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it has been expanded to automatically set up different modes . all these modes can set up for different ways of working under settings K@@ ile ... Ver@@ ily set up .
when beginning a new environment with the command \ \ \ &apos; environment } , &amp; hurry ; automatically add the command \ \ to { environment } into an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the key bar is removed , the last letter of input is removed and thus , the list can be reduced to the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump @-@ stamps can be found , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible , and the desired parameters can be collected then .
under Settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; you can set up your att@@ itudes to these lists . you can learn different W@@ ages for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as to be washed out of the general language @-@ used .
the command mode is not enough for the completion of environments . however , it is always used to specify a few letters with \ \ \ &apos; s . on the other hand , the command will be used so often that &amp; c@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments .
when calling the full@@ screen mode the menu will be automatically added to the menu or the keys to fill the environment automatically and it appears \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the environment can be made to the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be finished by pressing the button .
after this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; hurry ; know that it is a list of lists , it is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings , set up ... k@@ ile ; you can set up settings on these lists . this mode uses the desired list of the installation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; hurry ; supported custom lists of decre@@ asing cuts , which are set up immediately by l@@ acks to set up strings . as an example of a remote panel , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which , for example , is contained L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L entered and the word has been done through the menu item C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large windows are not helpful for automatic loading . however , it has been found that many wanted to be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; hurry ; the ful@@ ler is already written for everyone already written .
this mode can set up a c@@ ile in the menu of Settings ... C@@ ile ref@@ using . here , the swelling value can also be specified for the display of the ful@@ fil@@ ment .
the sample files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ ile / complete / mode / k@@ ile / Complete / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode . mode is available for download ( decre@@ asing ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designs are as simple as possible . to illustr@@ ate the basics of the graphic presentation , the sections should be respected and respected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for public de@@ preci@@ ation and re @-@ ordin@@ ances of pages . if the PDF output is installed , the PDF @-@ edition is re@@ arranged and then to be converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to pay attention to the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed together in the menu creation , create conversion and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the other conversion may be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS @-@ file and it can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS @-@ file .
when using the command , a viewer is usually inv@@ oked after comp@@ iling . if no inserted viewer should be used , each time it will open a new window .
a new project will discuss the project &apos;s new project .... See the following information for the project :
when running the file name , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r -@@ project file .
the script function of &amp; c@@ ile ; allows the extension of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ co@@ de . scrip@@ ture scripts can be managed in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
first , it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; col@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions will be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
it is not only to describe a description of all programs ( but a few key packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; col@@ ile ; in three major book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as you want help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k provides a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and this for a graphic surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the desired advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or whi@@ pped cream . by &amp; col@@ ile , then only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse , or the space bar , open the viewer for the document .
&amp; hurry ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be held on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; is also a part of Fink project , making &amp; c@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; also installed on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
much thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of &amp; k@@ ile ; project evol@@ ves and d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under contemp@@ t of &amp; GNU ; you can use the latest information on the contri@@ butors .

version 3.2 by &amp; quantitative ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative . all these tools use comp@@ any@@ as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a lower base . the combination provides fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; doesn &apos;t know what is working . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply click on a terminal ; simply click on it !
this application is a@@ waiting a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in a distinct work@@ folder . if not , then remove the reset selection folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when my m@@ c starts .
as I said already , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentary already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ aint , there is now a great graphic surface .
if the straight opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then let it simply select the current work folder . if not , then select the current work@@ folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an issue on screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the error and try again .
if the file is already tagged in &amp; quantitative , then let the current file simply checked . if not , delete the current file the bun@@ ches and select the file to be checking file with other file - file sel@@ ector .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ known is well @-@ known , then click the Well @-@ Complete review selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) ; ( External ) ; ( External ) ; supports the W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; diagram as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the indication of the definitions UR@@ I ; in the file sel@@ ector required .
yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus should be selected , then release the current file simply . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file format by using the other file sel@@ ector .
specify the file name , as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative , have with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug@@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can be used in &amp; quantitative . you can find the plug @-@ in in a large number of &amp; GUI ; you will find more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we begin using the plug@@ ins menu . so the following dialog is opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the contained plug@@ ins and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element inside :
here you can type the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins is used without a storage location &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; this path to search the plug @-@ in plug .
often , on a project several people work in a hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quantitative . supports specif@@ ying team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to identify unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and Sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by pressing the team member from the list and press the button S@@ etz@@ e as press . the currently selected member ( your identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is another benefit through the recording of the team members : it can be created an event for information to the team leader , if something specific happens . see for more information .
event promotions are actions , which are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will play a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page configuration configuration ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog boxes can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address list selected in the recipi@@ ents . the addressing can be a team@@ work or Sub@@ project Manager . see , we@@ i will be set up such ladder .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can be selected either of the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by note text .
notes can be sent a certain member of the team . in this case , the nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , the nickname in the project in the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub@@ project guides should be headed , as stated in the examples below .
nick@@ names and roll@@ ers @-@ names are independent of large or small not@@ ches , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; quantitative ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages that supports D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nostic and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ is@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the other can be found .
the settings can be set up using the Quant@@ ity settings . this dialog covers some pages that are treated with one another .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / Minor description of tags : big / lower@@ case of automatic tags . normal big / sm@@ elling means , the tags are inserted so as they are described in the everyday XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of attributes to automatically generated attributes . normal wholesale / lower@@ case means attributes such as they are described in the everyday XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if checked , is optional on tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this is inserted after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
automatically shut down tags : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags .
start and finish day automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding coding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
standard tab : encoding of newly created or in other ways as having opened file open files ( where the encoding of the file can be transferred ) . this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash the next start@@ up of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for not stored documents , a backup will be regularly created , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or documentation in a map ) which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings on the standard back next start@@ up is useful , if the user interface came through change the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to activate warnings from warning by no more inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization process of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ view mode in shared mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which depic@@ ts the picture of Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted for details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the structure tree causes the following action it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened to the editing and as deep in a modification of the structural tree automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are found in the current document , no element is found in the current document .
the range for placing cuts ( a kind of templates ) , which un@@ folds in the processing of larger text , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; it means a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause is something different means better than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part applications of third page , which can be used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , at the most well known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following is to be specified :
address : the path to the plug@@ in if there is not at a stand@@ ar@@ there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the folders ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses to load the shop . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts does not usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the Plugin : if the requested information is correct , check if the requested information is correct . then , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
in version 3.3 , the error procedure was developed completely new . the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of its support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations to plug@@ ins plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative . add .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Settings button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of super@@ vis@@ aged variables . appears usually in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action makes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ä@@ s . this action will be disp@@ at@@ ched by default when a project is opened , which must be considered to be a de@@ bu@@ gger .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to slide a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger display .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the current selected line . if this happens during the script , the execution is resumed . if this happens , the script will start with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without sending information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this happens during a script , the execution starts . if any claim has been given , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger opens the next script in the script without going to go into functions or any other .
the de@@ bu@@ gger opens the next script in the script , where possible in functions and includes def@@ aults .
proves the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the order and go to the next so there is not the current one .
open a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , the super@@ a@@ woke value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; adapt to your needs , and how you &amp; qu@@ is@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type E@@ diti@@ ved pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ; to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages ; they enable &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills like car complet@@ es and flexi@@ bi@@ de ; a fast , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s there are in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and &amp; CSS ; . day Fol@@ ders include two parts , the day file and the tool@@ bars . day Fol@@ ders are handy , symbolic glue from image bra@@ ids ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be ordered manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , A &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and layout and content of Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow rapid integration of tags to a document without risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ der are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to make other users a better viewing and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the options and borders will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it doesn &apos;t contain anything about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common @-@ attribute group and attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it displays the name and type of attribute . additionally , there will be more tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for filling used in the tag editor and attribute tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology has been used within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method@@ ology . the arguments given to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ ame % , meaning the name of the current tag .
a container day group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only be used for an attribute . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog box . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; page &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specify a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
specify a list of elements that end one day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin using a &amp; XML ; de@@ bil@@ ation begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 pixels = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly glu@@ ed and closed .
spaces affect nothing but watch out &amp; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML file , the tools dialog is to start up in &amp; quantitative . -@@ Windows to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check takes only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schem@@ es . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic .
in the following example , for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; transition function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor for this , easily accessible via D@@ TD . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
a action can be set with settings ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut of this action . by clicking the user button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action , this text is inserted into the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are the quick@@ start dialog , or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified trails are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ In this way : global scrip@@ ting folders : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ ATH . there are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will replace the current document &apos;s URL . in case of a local document file , file name : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script can input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input may be determined , which is to send to the standard input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the printed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal edition , printed on the default output ; error messages should be specified on the default output . it can be specified as the default output is set to the default output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the Mark@@ ups .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure promotions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and if the day attributes and you are planning to use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when available , enabling input to use the action possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignore ! is it a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use of the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we don &apos;t need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size others .
please note that the created icon does not only helps you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
in view that the day starts , I have decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least release a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ Day in the current document will insert .
after creating the symbol , it must still be linked to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; functions for tool bar , or it should set up this to better overview by some Tren@@ ner into several groups . open the tool bar and set out the tool bar . make sure that the tool bar is selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( left at the top ) for my tool bar . after choosing the element , added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not support group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or could be the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct folder . after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar should be saved in the correct folder , so that your tool@@ bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ att@@ ing language . this is why this chapter will explain how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; monitors ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we need to let the first part to you , the second we deal here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path ad , relatively to this file , for documentation HTML files , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # sections in Section 1 = Section 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , day 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the Document@@ ation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 ( PHP 4.2 ) = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # before getting started and Language Reference . it shows that it is about sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess set@@ ops ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
you can note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in addition at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but look at &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the section section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to display the context of context @-@ sensitive aid . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help the documentation should be displayed directly here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of separated @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save them to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / doc / quantitative / doc / quantitative / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / quantitative / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / quantitative / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / quantitative / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc /
if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud of being able to participate in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places , there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( DT@@ EP ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others can be downloaded , and only available if our team needs them to be accurate and useful for publication , for what it needs to be a GP@@ G / PGP key . this means that the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case you have several keys ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started .
up@@ loading can upload from the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD ( DT@@ EP ) menu , and upload tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems , and it can be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the name of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML language , which is currently not yet created by &amp; quantitative . it can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in everyday XML format . there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion may be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definitions row : the string , which in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
tuning of the DT@@ EP according to conversion : when activated , puts &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; after the conversion to the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quantitative , there are some key concepts . to understand this and take full benefits from &amp; quantitative . this chapter tries to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts , without whose understanding and quantitative . little benefit .
in &amp; quantitative , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bars about promotions , everything is selected as global , in the common order structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personal .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the order tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the module Nauti@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the editor window , the building views , the flash@@ ers with info@@ s and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click on the box with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all cart@@ ridges , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ or@@ area to another context menu concerning the edited documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , work under the mouse cur@@ sor or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the upper end of the editor , the tool bars are located . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new features and therefore connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert the tag in your document , then you can insert the data for this just filled day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate and navigate in the information , to navigate and pass through . in the presentation with card @-@ riders are available for files , project , sample positions , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction inten@@ tions .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , up@@ loading , or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ate ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the information available to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit , or send email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an elementary proposition , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the elementary proposition . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and evacu@@ ation of the building .
this tree appears among other construction inten@@ tions . with it , man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the change of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks may be made .
here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded and downloaded for documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be customized , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quantitative eas@@ ant ; two cart@@ ridges at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information : the information window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about each in a quantum running script . for example , the current D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , enter all error messages ( so it is ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate mill is the option to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar via email . &amp; Qu@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive to &amp; K@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le .
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf you can pass a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems when starting from &amp; quantum , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . you should also make sure that is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ ATH in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optim@@ ised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now already far on the path to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . together , you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quantitative eas@@ ing ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ er base is based . &amp; qu@@ ilt : it is not only possible to expand users , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quantitative eas@@ ants ; allows Web@@ Develop@@ ers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . through self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation and tool@@ bars can realize it . ( more about this you can find them in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ a ; the original developers fors@@ ook the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced .
more in the details of detail is to help with help : / qu@@ a ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run as help@@ a help : / qu@@ anti@@ a ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time , when you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . in the section above templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only a bug is reported .
conver@@ ts during inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters contained in &amp; HTML ; file data , so that they are correct and cannot be understood by the browser as a form@@ at@@ ment reference .
conver@@ ts the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to add &amp; URL , s into the anchor tag .
switches off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a row number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not in . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
evaluation and switching of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main problem . the problem rep@@ orters is enabled when switching to the structural tree .
displays the symbols column from the main window . this column allows you to bookmark the bookmark with a mouse click .
when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries predicted or next , depending on the cur@@ s@@ ors &apos;s position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension of .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . this enables you to copy graphics files to your project folder or folder , and then add it to the project .
invites the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ io Sl@@ aves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantum , you can find the details here .
invites a project tool bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the tool bar type : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool bar . we just need to save the name . actions need to store actions with settings . tool@@ bars are stored via tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the view . that del@@ etes it from your hard disk . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Team , so the tool bar opens in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new email message using the tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own coating format .
loading / refresh of entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense when the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this globally ist and write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent paste of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion signi@@ fies that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; using tool bar , if this day is ref@@ unded to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the listed menu points . click it . click on a activated plug@@ in disabled .
select the syntax indication for the current file . the list of available panels schem@@ es depends on der@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by using the external application Ti@@ dy .
immediate shut@@ down between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries change sometimes time need or unnecessary graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for every open sub@@ window . with a selection of a paper , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
sh@@ uts down the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main windows .
changes in this dialog influences any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate there is details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can add and follow the sequences .
this should create a help according to the Maus@@ oleum environment , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory , and should be completed by the top of the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be automatically set up with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
this is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ a ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can use the server address of the machine where you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote computer , an adaptation might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and the default template . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change the static web content . for ser@@ ver@@ ting scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
an employee if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be connected . if a project is re@@ installed by reason , don &apos;t hook .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to credit .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by h@@ ooks , by removing the bun@@ ny , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings , which can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be instantly upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tab in the sub@@ window profiles or using the key@@ hole shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option is listed above , including files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during the opening of the project , can be read more about project views .
this can be selected the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be adjusted to the options . in this case the de@@ bug@@ ging may be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , by hand an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as an mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , one can turn off event promotions and add these actions , change or delete actions . event transactions are executed when a previously defined event appears , such as the sigh@@ ting of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens and qu@@ anti@@ le ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
folders behave similarly , however , the entries are opened and open with ... in the right @-@ click pop@@ up menu :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in memory and forgot at the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog , if you change your opinion from the up@@ loading process .
in &amp; quantitative information , many high load profiles can be generated and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) are uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your plan@@ ing shaft , this is either a time saving function or a danger . if you have saved them after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu or project tool bar , accessible via the tool tool@@ bar tool bar , open or er@@ ased .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your own way of work .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le . best over the menu of tool@@ bars . use and add to distinguish . adding tool bars will be covered down in the adding of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set in either by context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , creating tool bar , tool bar , tool bar , which can be displayed in the dialog , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries action will be removed and action edited that are self explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up set up in the menu with settings of tool@@ bars ... and set settings .
templates are in essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code escal@@ op@@ es and files to link . you can copy , move , move or any existing system existing in the storage room . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ le ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are inserted into documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the storage space under global templates . more information to the templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally you &apos;ll find a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information to the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document , based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . some examples are found in the storage space under global templates . see for more information to the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for all sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
design a document structure for you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template as local template ....
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with pulling and shut@@ down on the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a template folder . you can use all file administration functions to be used , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of Con@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view onto a folder view and secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates allow a highly targeted demonstration . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or connected with them . additionally you can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / templates / templates files . each of these folders equ@@ ates to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text , or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes is ver@@ ti@@ pped .
this is enabled by default and fits all out of the ancest@@ or in the system overview . if a regular folder would be set out in this path , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like Text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , it is probably located in a regular folder .
allows for previous or introduced text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines and foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p all templates for a specific project , and allows to equi@@ p all templates for a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er for a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , we have the context menu ( indicate your right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative : offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which allows the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the Second divi@@ des the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor acts as follows : he re@@ charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and edit the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
in working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; it is necessary to edit this directly using the V@@ PL ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously runs , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ sor is activated from a window to another , where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via adjustments ( V@@ PL ; ) you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically after a click or automatically . basically , the recommendation can be set for quick calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow machines .
assum@@ ing you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties , so as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . it serves as a new document with the V@@ PL ; this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows the amend@@ ment of the In@@ hal@@ tes , for example keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing sites in the browser . you can add CSS rules using the buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS class@@ y setting by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a word processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . text can be used as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by typ@@ ing or removed .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , such as in the source text editor , which is inserted in the source text already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , which is inserted with text , each other has to be removed .
some tool bars such as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ Assistent are disabled . later , they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of sty@@ lists . in contrast to other elements for sty@@ lists , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style can be followed .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contri@@ butors had made many changes and simultaneously changed the rec@@ ir@@ culation . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in collaboration .
the program used by me was showing me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the changes had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many useful functions were added later .
for example , if you wish to compare text quickly , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
3 @-@ way con@@ jun@@ ctions will be fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently of each other on a piece of Ko@@ de and changes the original file . in this editor , you can edit the resolutions at the same time . in this editor , you can even edit the result at the same time . in this context , the display shows three source files at summar@@ izing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge folder . this screen saver shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and look similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , this can be seen at a glance at a summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when No@@ body changes the return . )
when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease your typ@@ ing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
diff@@ use 3 folder 1 order folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 folder
the opening dialog allows manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file for next time ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge command will be selected , for B and C , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when interaction is crossed , the input field is active for the purpose and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file , but you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens up a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before you begin using the same / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board in the active comparison window . in opening dialogue you will need to select the dialog simply by the Canc@@ el button .
you can also pull pulling and pull off : pull a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file such as several similar functions . if you would like to find out how similar to these features , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to upload two relevant files , it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare them . now you can easily copy the relevant sections .
note : currently you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; remove only the release of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drawing and put text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data may be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the Info line . the Info line contains the characters A , B , or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small au@@ xili@@ ary window will display the full name . )
the three source codes are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color which distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ is the default color for this . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
left next to the text is the gathering column . when differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful only to see relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , B. are white signs only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line , separates files from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line will be displayed on the broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ators ) also has an Info line with the inscription edition : , the file name and &#91; Ge@@ e &#93; if you have processed the outcome , it usually contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , any difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlighted the current group . this group will appear with the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes the automatic merge or manual editing does not leave any more line in the group ; then it &apos;s only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; encoding process ; appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the outcome window . be careful with this function .
note : if you want to ignore the sources , ignore the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also covered as white signs .
navigate primarily with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keys on the left , right , down , side down , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . in addition to the vertical image line , you can also click navig@@ ating to Navig@@ ate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the paste button , you can switch between plug @-@ in and trans@@ verse mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the assem@@ bling columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as in the section summar@@ izing and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ image A@@ way / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous conflict as a conflict . therefore , sol@@ dering and un@@ resolved conflicts has to be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you will need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . however , this option will automatically copy and manually release the manual . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally write the content of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in pre@@ ference \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ line of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not with binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when the next start@@ up . ( menu In@@ stell@@ un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a let@@ tering with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also features variable width to choose which you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be sign@@ alled . on these systems the button settings automatically creates an un@@ even colour .
when this option is activated , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the one line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , every selection is automatically copied to clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board manual .
you can select which type @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual choice on the used operating system .
with the compar@@ ing of files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical lines can be ignored in the source file . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white notes will not be ignored . white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ back string &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ sliding mark , but then , files are treated with different sizes on the side @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but as a white character will be treated . during clas@@ p , this option must be disabled . in default , this will be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still shown but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in the auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next un@@ solved conflict is passed .
remove automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection ) . if you need this only from time to time , then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are covered in Chapter for scanning and execute a merge . check for details below documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already existing version exists , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and re@@ boot , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is selected globally on the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice , which is the local encoding . ( this can be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this is influenced as special characters treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have a file processed , you can define which encoding is to be used for storing files .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output command .
turn this off to supp@@ ress emphasis added in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal information column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply blend the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to bring the files compressed into the merge menu , then , if you &apos;re using only two files . ( if this function is used to start the merge file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut trou@@ bling parts or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only with the command processor . the output of the command is used only with the line of pre@@ processor . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable users to enable more flexibility when set the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases , or per@@ l perfect .
in this context , use this pre @-@ processing command for line letters to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ 1 in the replacement string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems apply some key words to automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word subst@@ itution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ \ _ \ \ \ _ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . however , it &apos;s good as an example of a further pre@@ ference command for line comparison . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any indication between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to carry out multiple settings at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate them from each other . example :
instead of this , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are given at per@@ l some more details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires Per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; .
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and guidance . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ pre @-@ pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and comp@@ ile complete folder with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes without having to perform them really ,
... runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ ing and merge single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are combined , the folder 1 will be used as the basis . if no target file was specified , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not select the merge , you must select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about the actual progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed until then .
when scanning the folder , it shows &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is normally folded together by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories . all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , this is visible in columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about any problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , however , the colour is identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their total content is identical . then folders are the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green then yellow and later , when it is old , red will .
... A and C identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types exist . as long as such fla@@ wed objects may exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types exist . as long as such fla@@ wed objects may exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders were specified . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : bring together and save the result in both folders . ( the user watches as the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; right after the merger , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be merged and select the newer file instead of merge , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and if the files are different , but the date does not appear .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not fixed , the merge folder can not be started .
during arran@@ ging , a file will be done after the others . the status column displays Fer@@ tig when the merger is successful , and according to other messages , when something unexpected is completed , you should make a final check and see whether the status is fine .
if in setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can comp@@ ile either the selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ files ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folders , then in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ges mode C , the target will be chosen as the target and when using synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , check if all entries must be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through certain entries . check these options for avoid unpleasant surprises :
to bring all the entries together : select directory merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ hole ) : select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if any conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ t@@ less elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will lead to the Options , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you wish to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge one single file ) , then a merge window will open ( see the screen photo ) .
when you are finished with a file , select a directory to run / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you &apos;ll notice a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll find some error messages that help you to skip the cause of the problem , or solve the problem@@ atic entry . so you have the opportunity to solve a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the interaction .
if some entries were individually compiled , re@@ members &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them all entries again . even if the meetings are ski@@ pped , these entries will be considered correctly . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will appear in the original tree . you can enter the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the original tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the original tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files which also would be ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ esystem , files have a disk attribute . in other file systems a previous score is selected as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when links on files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
in links to Fol@@ der : if the option is switched off , the links are compared as normal folders . if the option is switched on , the links to a folder will lead to itself . ( note that this option would lead to a loop and de@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is locked in default .
runs a full analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower than it does not contain text . ( specify an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large folders via a slow network , it might be faster , only the change date and the file size . this speed advantage is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this may be useful if copying the change date has been lost . please be careful with caution . this option is locked in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , these proposals will be selected to merge that both folders are saved in both folders . this option is also checked in the default .
if there are differences , will be proposed to copying the newer file as an action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure because the other file doesn &apos;t change . you should check this in any case . ) This option is default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file is already existing , this will also be deleted without further backup . this will also affect the complete assembly of individual files , not only the merge command . this option is enabled by default .
usually , the folders @-@ merge view remains visible to the merge of single files ; you can turn off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to share the main window in the window menu , turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu , you can also select a single file directly , without having to execute the file , the status will be added to you and the file will not run again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ io Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open local or remote hosts .
the first command line uses a local file on a FTP server . the second command line uses a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively short or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , neutral &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ focal o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link goal . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit author@@ iz@@ ations or change date . therefore , the author@@ iz@@ ations or change date from the original . ( see this option only in local files ) .
the main reason for this purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ c . K@@ Dev@@ c first starts to launch the built @-@ in differences . to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer , and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually required &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . if there is at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch patch will start to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if there is no original files . besides , the original files have changed since generation of the Patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons by folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Kom@@ pare ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I already use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by working in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone that way or let it go .
you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are described first as the same ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if IF , the next to each other , this ent@@ is co@@ bra is the case .
the editor appears for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this key information is lost when the result is simply saved when the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can restore a certain version using a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; released and the text can &apos;t be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight them . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes you will find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source package .
to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic sub@@ folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ ile . should , however , problems occur on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position resp@@ . replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current version of the program you need to re@@ locate the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries to exhibit the differences . this also causes that identical files do not contain these files in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing following the merge . ( the behaviour is probably shut down in a later program version . ) This option is default .
note the buttons to select the source with label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the outcome window ( if the lines are already available ) , if the lines are already present , click on the button again .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ shooting in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual space areas . it is quite practical to change the ongoing programmes on the work@@ spaces , to stop them or move them . this works both in a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual space areas as well as the ongoing applications . applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to another .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both in a desktop and other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when clicking on the empty back@@ drop of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click on the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if clicked on an application .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only if clicked on an application .
if this check box is checked , window can be shifted inside the &amp; shelf ; s with middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual space areas are displayed .
cross this field can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual space areas . if it comes along with name , the names will be provided with ordin@@ arily numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , running programs will be shown as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their choice .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol indicates a small view@@ point of the real program icon . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; like from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows banks ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual space surfaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with its content and move it out outside the control panel .
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and you can set up a switch from the switch ... letting the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. Falls , you must register as user root or address to your system administrator . in this file you must include the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this one value . possible values are :
since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; likes ; it &apos;s a screen size . you can play with &amp; may ; make a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users ; this application includes artists , Web designer and people with a vision . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; may ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you &amp; likes ; start a window as shown above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window will be shown as a magni@@ fying window , the enlarged section of the screen and is described in the following as the selection pane .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor like a mov@@ able micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can &amp; may ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse pointing at the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
would you like to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse pointing out . this is still not able to identify the form of the maus@@ oleum . this is always the default form ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with arrow keys .
if you are adding the &amp; Shift , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection box remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; may ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy in a file to insert the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts and stops the updating of the display . stops of updating that the needed CPU time is going to be 0 .
select the update rate ( very low , straight , medium , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will be shown . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your entered short commands to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ ades ( with the button document back in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc .
also known as &amp; K@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print area in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from the research or artist to the web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click at the same point . it is thought to help people who use the repet@@ itive stra@@ ins of In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and that every mouse click p@@ ains . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the drag with the mouse . this also requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can cope with pain when using mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may find pain associated with the use of your computer so you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it even clear@@ er : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps in clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by using the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic agents , the result may be different for each .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click away once you break the motion briefly .
is the intelligent shift activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after pressing the mouse button , wait until the end of the motion , before the release of the mouse button is done . this way , you can drag the bricks with the pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a bit of exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , this time must be silent before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the time turns is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before starting the mouse button , if there is no problem in the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow move to the right and back brings a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but the first time has started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the Sound System and the tab General . there &apos;s a push @-@ down sound buffer where you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; rest@@ art@@ ed at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; please note that this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please note the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program .
sets all settings back to the values when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button user button , the settings will be reset to date after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart shifting should be switched off first . if you have used to get used to the automatic mouse click later .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce ant@@ is@@ ks of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should make yourself conscious of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display un@@ dar@@ ed reactions . therefore , you can park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is j@@ erk@@ y , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that get in touch with the mouse ball .
first of all , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . however , it should be quick , if you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the side of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not allow the operation through the release of the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can re@@ work as usual .
problem : when you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and put the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have him . but by pushing the mouse on a neutral field of desktop , if you have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the smart shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to run it into the clip@@ board , and to add it into any other action , but it will probably only cause problems again . here are some advice :
do not use intelligent shift , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; lead to the end of the text area a mouse click , while keeping the cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . by way , the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click is played . so you know exactly when smart shifts take the shifts . later you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to have the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows ; this should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; runs the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor briefly . this program has been developed for people working on RS@@ I syndrome and where the people of the bri@@ ghtest pain is processed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button starts . in this way , drag and dro@@ pping can be performed using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ my users can talk to their computers for themselves .
with the Program &amp; C@@ mouth ; you can let dum@@ b users speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the dialogue process that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) , type the command , which is later used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text password . you can often choose from the text passages without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be processed .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) , you specify the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can read the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains basically a input field for the key@@ presses of your phrases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a le@@ ak @-@ memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the phrases that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory . you can select them phrases that are spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice over@@ s and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the map output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the sel@@ ector field , specify the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . choose the check box if the text should be distributed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to the voice @-@ over@@ s of your language generator depends on this command . find this command in the documentation to your language generator .
use as bank@@ note as language service &amp; mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be provided on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice @-@ over@@ s . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action , after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ ers .
with the selection of so@@ res , the chosen text passage is inserted directly and added in the box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is only entered into the input field .
with the second selection box closing the editing window for text passages , you can specify if the text pass@@ age@@ book will be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when you choose to save changes , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the text @-@ pass@@ age@@ book will not be saved . if you select any changes , choose &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ age@@ book should be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the dictionary . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ective field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can select the currently used dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
using the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , which change the sequence of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
choose the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; read the number of single words . additionally , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can comp@@ ile the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; C@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summar@@ ised , and how these can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main range of the window to machining text pass@@ ers is divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ ers are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can select the passage passage , or the corresponding key signature . if you choose a text pass@@ age@@ way , you can only change its name .
actions , such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either navigate directly to the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text pass@@ ers or text passages by pulling the mouse to the new job or with arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text is selected in the input field , the selected parts will be used otherwise .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text @-@ section is selected in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected parts of the run memory .
the moment@@ ary sentence is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the transfer memory .
if this menu entry is crossed , a different tool bar is displayed by default in the editing window directly under the menu bar . by click on the un@@ refined left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not attached , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a different bar for text pass@@ ers are displayed by entries . by default , the bar can be moved directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool bar . by clicking on the refined left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
probably you have the command to have the voice @-@ over@@ s correctly or not fully entered . open Settings ... , open the page General Settings and specify the command for voice @-@ over@@ s on the card @-@ edition . ( see Settings dialog for Language Comp@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a speech output system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use it free of charge and distribute the festival without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of command line for the command line , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command devices :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ ons into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text into phon@@ em@@ es . it allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use it for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / ham@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional notes must be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat ; ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / d@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ / us@@ r / local / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; n / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending the option data as default input must be switched on .
the VO dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further voice @-@ over@@ s that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently being developed by SV@@ N . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being used in SV@@ N . he uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems .
since the language set is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only as possible as language service in &amp; mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice command , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; C@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , text through the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken phrases can be saved , which the user can always re@@ produce again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a mou@@ th@@ izer . on the computer you have to have a language izer installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a source of existing service , which allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ over@@ s ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . it also offers interesting options .

before you &amp; use ; you must install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
with the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are furnished , the map of the card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map menu will be posted . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different types of male , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is referred to as a speaker . you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher does not use the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same synthes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
when you click on the top card reader speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map of the card will be displayed automatically , if you start the kt@@ m@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up .
all speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker will be used for voice @-@ over@@ s when there is no speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the actors from the list .
select a mouse click a button from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click a button from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a tune type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as boys and girls to choose from .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the card box appears . to change the att@@ itudes of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back to the map menu General and check if voice @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service can be enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to make text read . click on the map ticket to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card @-@ card reader to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and allow you to read and proceed . see . remove the marking , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically when reading the control panel , it disappears again when reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can start text jobs , stop , stop and res@@ ume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click on the user or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the map ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the maps and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ er and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text first . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then mark the text that should be read before and select the text output in the main menu .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of informed events . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read out .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up different types of messages if your nickname has to be not@@ ified in which your nickname can occur . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears in menu entry not@@ if@@ ications for this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify can vary depending on application .
filter for drawing cart@@ oons offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wron@@ g@@ ly stressed or incorrect to correct news . you remove the tag b@@ r and b out of the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts .
filters will be edited text before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace incorrect spoken words or short@@ cuts , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech@@ es and their voices .
to understand the operation of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the Edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other contracts . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the requested jobs will be resumed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and ordinary text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next priority priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; cover ; you can welcome someone who enters the room just . &amp; k@@ de ; Not@@ ification is also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text entries . any order , which you use from the map ticket orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text applications . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders types are handled in queu@@ es , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . when a application reads the output of a screen re@@ boot , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such examples , this output will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filters work the text and pass it on to the next filters . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
drawing string replacing parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will enable the replacement of chat @-@ emot@@ icons like : - ) by text , or for the form@@ at@@ ement of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former using an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
with speech filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the text , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have posted a female voice at the map of the card , you can read text by K@@ DE messages on this page . read more about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter fails to apply his rules , he continues the text unchanged at the next filters .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters , which are arranged on the page below . the processing through the filter takes place in order in the list from top to bottom .
this displays the list of a mounted normal filter . if a filter has not been crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be removed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will be shown on the following setup dialog .
for the installation of string filters , you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . if the text is exchanged in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . bulk and lower@@ case is not considered compared to comparison .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose the name that you can only distinguish from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column replace . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that store your current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter is used only if the speaker is used for the text order one of the languages registered here . click on the button to select a list of the languages . you can also select several languages if you click at the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl ; key .
if a value is entered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail
you can get the user @-@ ID @-@ running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers have to leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only copy them .
the string of the string filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with a post in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all the texts .
in comparison of words , the string filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you cannot find instructions to write regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Prin@@ ciples can be found in the am@@ big@@ u@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such transform@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program has to be installed on your system .
enter the path to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ ATH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
you can send texts to a particular spokes@@ man , who is set up texts to a certain speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can define that texts by K@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features that select the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sending and the features of the speaker posted on the map material , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied , if the text has the given regular expression . ist on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular users can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the required filter conditions . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected which matches the desired requirements on the right . click the button right to show the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the spre@@ ader filter will only apply to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box may apply . you need to apply at least one condition .
the VO API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .

I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ shaping filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone to do so . that you have to do so if you do not have this voice to read from websites . also , make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and found on the environment variable P@@ ATH .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing fish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding is set to the correct level . if there are problems with specific characters or words , these may be solved by a string regulator . see .

to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; available from the source code for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently available , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language . you can use the shell scripts sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is designed to be developed so that the configuration of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be dismant@@ led in single sentences . the user can go back or leave the output , stop or cancel the output .
if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can request a female English spokes@@ man for the issue . if you have a speaker , this can be used for example , if you want to learn more , otherwise the best suited speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a speaker , see you in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab on the map or on the list , click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add @-@ Set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . for details of the modules you can find details on the modules below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specify the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in P@@ ATH , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages are used to use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regulator , and these grey will not be displayed , the voice of you chosen this settings cannot be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded in size multiple seconds due to their size . when you check this check box , these voices will already be charged by the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( for larger memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up any speaker ( or forgot to click on user ) . see .
if this check box is marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window t@@ m@@ gr displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text , so you have the possibility to read or disp@@ atch the procedure .
here , all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , together with the application , the current status of the order , the number of phrases and the working set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can go on behalf , which is selected in the list below , proceed or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr can be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here only text entries are performed and managed . editions of screen editing , warnings and news are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal aging speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program so@@ x must be installed .
click Apply &quot; to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works on you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the Edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other contracts . after the edition of the Screen Reader has been read , the recorded orders are resumed .
warnings have priority priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and ordinary text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News is the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e .
these audio file will always be played if a normal word order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory news .
the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text applications . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Not@@ ify messages can be read , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on not@@ if@@ ications . the map messages appears .
mark this check box to turn off the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is un@@ checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is selected , not@@ if@@ ications will be played in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the Add , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before sending the conversation ; if anyone men@@ tions your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
all events that are indicated in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired interview . standard choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map of the map by the top of the map . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . if a specific event is specified for certain application , this will be done . otherwise , the action will be performed for all other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action will be given to fru@@ ition , which was set under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ if@@ ications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can define the not@@ if@@ ications for this :

the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice @-@ over@@ s . this standard includes brands for the control of voices , voice speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival in the SS@@ ML edition is used .
if the settings for speed or pitch included in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually called very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ in @-@ mar@@ gin@@ ally filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . this way , the first sentence has to be synthes@@ ized , not all the text order . thus , you can also stop or skip all the text , even if the language ass@@ izer is not directly supported .
here you see the set of mar@@ gin@@ alisation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a prec@@ ursor of a set of mar@@ gin@@ alisation filters . you can alter its settings or add more Sat@@ is@@ ure@@ ener@@ ge@@ finder , but beginner is not recommended .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est you learn from the language selection by trying . switch on the box selection , change some features and check out how the selection of the speaking driver has changed . you must , of course , have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start with the pre @-@ read , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you record text orders on the map ticket orders or can break off , even if the language value does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ vity filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , just remove anything from this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
set of pro@@ positi@@ vity filters compare text with a regular expression of pun@@ ctu@@ ation and adding a tab@@ ular signs ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the Sat@@ .1 limits ( tab@@ ulation Code ) to the set of filters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set of mar@@ g@@ inal det@@ erg@@ ents may maintain the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , news or the output of screen reproduction are applied .
if you have removed the normal view of the mar@@ gin@@ ally mar@@ gin@@ ally filter , you can add them back by selecting the file _ sb@@ dr@@ c included in &amp; kt@@ ts .
in the map selection menu , you can write the speech settings for the application . the map menu will be displayed if
using the standard speaker ( the top on the map ) . in other words , there will be no talk properties .
use of the most custom@@ ary microphone , which has all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit , elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most originally entered properties .
select the method to input the desired spre@@ y properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired interview here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , you don &apos;t give anything .
mark this check@@ box when the property should have priority before other features . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is , this is always used as a priority feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is prior to which you may know that there is a particular application text in another language compared to the working environment .
to use all properties in the field , the most likely to delete the following , click on the select button , and then use speakers that matches the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .

the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears on the &amp; console ; appears : -@@ to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA can prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find references for possible solutions on the website of AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Ku@@ t@@ .org .
I &apos;ve invited an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can &apos;t use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices , add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developer .
on the card of the card , there is a setting speed . so this works , the program so@@ x needs to be tra@@ ce@@ able and via the environment variable P@@ ATH . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed will be ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( it &apos;s about your own tags , which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ format filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I do not create that websites with a female voice can be read . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice .
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the X@@ SL file casts down from SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language izer is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer used in its source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , voice speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help to read the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions .
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set up the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you want to set up the Russian voices , select a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; lin@@ ux distribution program . therefore , look for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding process has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ synthes@@ izer . then it takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ centre , enabling the management of network interfaces , the route and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a set of system and desktop settings over a single , integrated surface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ centre ; can be called by choosing K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network setting in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network setting ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical equipment and their drivers need to be operational and configured to be configured and configured to configure the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing and installed . network devices later added , the driver must be added later , corresponding to the following files , according to core version , are loaded :
the module network settings is loaded when selecting network settings at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network setting , this system is trying to detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform is not detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release date . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ inquiries , this option can be set permanently . at the next start@@ up of the network setting , the selection will be automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network setting is possible only in the system administration mode . in advance , all options are displayed , which means change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system management mode the complete functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three Reiter :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network appliances . all available network devices will be displayed . the following tasks are displayed on the network interfaces :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the settings displayed on network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to view Advanced Options dialog .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are brought from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be required for the system at the same time . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP Server will automatically send any additional settings . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration must be specified . the input field IP address must specify the TCP / IP address .
if this setting is checked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values set in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in &amp; console ; you can determine if the required address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch on one @-@ off network device is made by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub @-@ network that medi@@ ates physical connection to remote networks and is used by default in the TCP / IP communication with computers in other backing .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS assistance will be replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the computer uses htt@@ p : / / www.@@ l@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS replaces this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to nam@@ ing the name &apos;s name resolution allows simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a application and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons below or down under the top priority .
by clicking the button to add ... from the batch machine for nam@@ ing resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is inserted into the list .
from the batch machine for nam@@ ing resolution , select an entry and then click Edit button . it &apos;s going to edit the dialog pane .
the list of well @-@ known hosts describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address settings for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with bo@@ oting if no DNS servers will be available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses will support . this is still in the test version of IP to replace Version 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add the dialog of the New alias . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add . if the known host has multiple alias names , press the button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... Edit dialog box is displayed .
one of the following tasks can be performed , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , you have to be in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set off .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and to install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the install tool .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this will only recommend experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; you should comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files will be discussed .
this area can not replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integ@@ rating the PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
currently , IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 is expected to have no major distribution . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the address to assign IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to address a valid IP address or if available , the IP address can not be chosen freely .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts using the global ( Internet ) network . these addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore its own use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 through 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks to 250 machines .
additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second one is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = one &apos;s own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP transfer line .
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files are being affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes change with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is any other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is completely sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ cage . another stand as expected can occur .

it appears standard k@@ de ; print dialog . if you pick out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the dialog dialog .
print the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ ity &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar which provided my wife : how much longer takes it when you take it ?
before a band can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trained the band and reads the pre@@ tension information of the tape . recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the previous credits are not , you &apos;ll be asked whether the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the previous record , searches for the right index on your record . can &apos;t this be found , you will be asked if the tape index is to be created .
if everything goes well , the icon is changing for the tape drive to indicate that the tape is bound . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the tape .
prior to throwing the tape , the integration must initially be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change in the symbol for the band that the band has been resolved and displayed a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a band @-@ cards must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted with form@@ att@@ ing up data . this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted before you form@@ at@@ ted a band before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives are usually used to form@@ att@@ ing the tape , DA@@ T drives , however , does not use .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat . all data on the tape are lost ! upon completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the backup file , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
mark a secure profile in the tree . only those files stored in the profile are stored .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
click the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the saf@@ ern menu ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings will open for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files , and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives associated with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the testing process has been launched , the dialog settings for review . in this dialogue you can check once again your selection and change the file folder for checking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can establish the restore , the files you need to be restored . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only be restored by selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
click the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in menu @-@ restore ....
once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog settings for rest@@ oring . in this dialogue you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore progress . this dialog shows the progress of progress and data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it re@@ jects itself as necessary to re@@ produce the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape &apos;s content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ produce the index on two types of tape :
this will create a secure profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder , where the backup is to be carried out . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work@@ folder .
for any folder that are listed under backup files , apply only the files stored on the same file system , such as folder . folders that are listed on other file systems . each entry is considered by tar ir@@ respective of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files have changed since then .
the file name , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
release the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; it was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ former version of the belt door .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; c@@ dat before the tape is integrated , the command will be loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary , before reading or writing operations .
is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the outlet to lock up the tape drive . probably this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched ON , the tape is cast off ; automatically shut the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to communicate the block@@ size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The volume ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , the computer name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the ep@@ och in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for unwanted users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information about problems linked to their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system records the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can perform fast access to information about problems linked to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced features may be prepared , filtered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Samba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with their help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort out . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter on this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ systematic log ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - to open . if you have a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you will probably not find the protocol files under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or after referred to the filter bar . in the default setting , the list box includes the filter All . then a protocol line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns contain the character string of the filter search results .
you can also select another entry in this place , and then select another entry in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , and carry out in the filter bar the name of a process , so you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a show@@ less color as protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the colour display of protocol rows can be switched to setup dialog .
if you only want to display certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command like for example to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add @-@ In &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; context menu of the main window to view all the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage your sub@@ window . once you select a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a dedicated website to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. there you will find more recent information on the source of sources by &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; in addition , you will find it in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; ) This section introduces a few concepts , and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it rapidly evol@@ ves to the standard for monitoring the system start in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( for example , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why anyone could try to put a machine on System V in@@ it , without a re @-@ installation and re@@ format . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are in / etc . this folder called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local ought to be below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for this . you can also use r@@ c.@@ conf to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to run out something with the serial port .
the kernel looks for different spots after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point , you can throw a look into the second column , and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can fix / etc / in@@ itt@@ any of your hand . if you want to change it , then you will repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start the right scripts ? if you enter it -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no right files are located . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts it is written thus that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scrip@@ ting in the command line as follows :
this would hold the htt@@ pd Server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one comes , the script will stop using the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , that lets you run only htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running out . additionally , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not to say : drag a record from the field of availability for one of the six run@@ ways to start at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eln or move the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this will not occur if they pull out an entry from the field of availability system services .
note : entries will be moved if you select them in a new area . to select them only on a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range .
the sorting number of a single entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting boxes , before you can try to add the system service .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries , which have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different operating areas ( availability system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor keys to make a choice of over@@ - or below the previous .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level ( C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the tab button to switch between different fields . connect the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card changes .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ ard , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in individual use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual .
the way , how system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
in case you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are provided by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) just end up if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us more information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
in order to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the appropriate icon of tool@@ bar or entry storing in the menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user tro@@ users . to edit , select the desired users or the requested group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the user &apos;s dialog or group features .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have enabled extended system settings for users . only if you have enabled space constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will appear on which you can view individual settings , if Shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD uni@@ x .
the card password authority appears , if Shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD , are installed .
this card card appears only if for at least one embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , each user may change parameters , whereby the limits are subject to KB .
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the option of the file system .
the map menu provides information on the user &apos;s assigned service . the default group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the prime group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the user or group menu or click on the matching add button of tool@@ bar . to edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is similar .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove , remove , change systems , remove , change , change and more .
