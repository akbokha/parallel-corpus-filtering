<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations of translations are not dependent on the translation in advance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts can be translated directly to the Babelfish-page, where you can add-to-translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite its low size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & Conqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>

<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root tip of the document, for example: the documentan element, all other nodes are subelements of this root shield.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & Conqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text messages to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & fsview; consists in the form of a so-called Tree-Map graphically displayed. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the subordinated objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, fsview can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. to simplify navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over to color mode, can be either a depth for the slight detection of the flavoids or the picture of another file name such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify if there is enough space for displaying, or if the surface of subordinated rectangles is present, then you can set the relative position of the label in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of time algorithms for Treemaps the size should be adhered to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview; this goal is not always adhered to the size of the entries, and this framework will not always be provided, so that less space for the frame is lost when rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As an arrangement of the surface is carried out for the subordinated entries, the implementation is left to it. in this case, it is possible for the label and to avoid space losses incurred by the framework, that rectangles are created as possible. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns, or recursive second division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal surface of an entry on the menu entry view. instead, a pattern pattern is drawn into the surface of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are stored on data transfer by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission to the computer. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also use serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gphoto2 for communication with digitameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras are using serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers beyond the serial port. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will definitely need to find a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use this database as well as in the image files. if you don't even have quick search and secure archiving to access you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you want to build any of your system. you must decide whether you want to save it on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them on a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location. if you were able to organize your date in one year. if you have enough photos, then you will be able to use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files do match? the separation of file types makes stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option stored in & digiplug; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? for this, & digiplug is provided with them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you want to select each photo words, labeling and review. of course, you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now talk with keywords, keywords, as you are often called by other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you have cataloged images from another source with embedded sampling, then & digiplug; automatically setting the tree to the right place. the reversing of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling one subtree to another. the modified keywords are being updated by & digiplug; updated while there is the lower trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is cut, because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data consists of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to cataloguise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of you don't want to see most of your photos just simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe to arrive like your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! you can begin to dream, associations, the historic period is again present, you may even hear the silence of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer, to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">"" "" "" "it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with an inscription for themselves alone." ""</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can even export a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time. if you export your pictures to web-galleries, you'll have to tell the story so much for the publishing process no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the time before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before googleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train is already running with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalisation are innumerable. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your journeys with geographic information. so you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; using Google google maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice of copyrights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographers, e.g. to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then it can no longer be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author row): associated with the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of the photographer, freelance photographer, freelance photographer, or independent commercial photographer. as this is a note to the author, it must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who this photo offers. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, this will be shown here. if the picture is a stock photo, then here the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't offer any protection against abuse. anyone who has little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator. for individuals, this is only very important to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digiplug; will provide such a module for forklift processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record defects, record outage, blackouts, ECC, transmission error, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that you can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, these are problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics, which has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these can be treated more difficult and you cannot get more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that has a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your readjustment room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD covers are not more expensive than the cheapest, but they write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistake, even if you just have written a control box mechanism to protect itself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control cases. in spite of this massive dust they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster. it works with Windows and & Linux; but it's still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to get damaged disks of damaged disks, harddisks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus said almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is said to CDs and DVDs is also applicable to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in an unpropriated format. also read the media with a description, date & author license and afterwards protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discarcase retain their statistics for itself. your producergents include a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: disruptive study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly, discos will be at the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature control, this error may not determine the immediate imminent failure. some of SMART sends an imminent failure. these are especially readers and publishing companies. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a current failure, but these losses are normally recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices Powered not much, this can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes, complete data loss, hardships and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy heat absorbs and the rest grounded. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in. remember that not every plug-bar contains also an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should mind that it fulfills the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects against lightening and protects the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers can also provide overvoltage spills which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, they are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete outage. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unwanted data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a ruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting your devices, these devices can automatically adjust the power failure. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk to be exposed to your computer system and get rid of its security in power problems with the cost to avoid this. this is only a small price difference if you may concern your computer with it. at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar cost; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data across the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online memory services that are limited to photos. their free memory will not be available to you in the case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be verified only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol, and in the large companies offer backup and a partial memory. therefore, they are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you don't tell us if this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of transmission lusts, since they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable at low level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with his btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workload systems. for notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think. it is limited to lower damage, such as theft or re-installments. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for long.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigative process during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file has not been completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. the idea is that the technology continues to develop. sensitivity and characteristic characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixad sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteriorated for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras are your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk can be held today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for any data loss. so, if you do not have any other data loss after one plan and test this up before you do something dangerous like the re-installation of your operating system, make the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hit you if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster beats locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterbow gives always a non-local storage. bring your backup up the stairs, into the adjacent house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as stated above already is a common reason for a data loss despite ensuring the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">A complete backup: a complete backup of all files is to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup. creates a complete snapshot of two times: the full backup and that of the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. this backup will restore the original status at any time again. this fuse comes to a versioning system next with the exception that it is just sliding and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machine. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to DVD or another visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup yet with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for each month. every additional dilution should be done manually after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,...</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period of time you're really interested in you, because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies to be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider and reassess everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain wax. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or change open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to zoom in on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, if your new record has been detected by the system, but don't hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">& pedro; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC # Source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBB; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no longer exists, you can create this self. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. but it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is needed for a lot of administration, but not as many as TIFF. this format will recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression salggerm (deflate). a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful camera regulator is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe is introduced to replace his XML-based XMP technology; it is a mix of XML and RDF. it is a mix of XML and RDF. it is a mix of XML and quot; .xmpquot; saved the file information; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, but it records the metadata separately from the image file. it can be seen separately from the link between the metadata and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of application and business models. on the activities of DCMI communities, the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the reader or scanner. as long as you can use the pictures on the camera, you can use it as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert rough files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a very complex editing, you can use external programs. if you use the images back to & digiplug; then you should add the metadata back. these were cut off from other programs under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it to Webgaleries, code in mpeg, use in contact, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the section add a photo to an album, you can find a description as you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a pigmentary indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file access for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are shown on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a single entry and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information, which is internally saved from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras, all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this invites you to check all photos of their camera in a single album in & digiplug. in downloading the pictures will not be deleted and we will advise you if you delete pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; select the button download and then download the chosen selected. the button selected is as long as you have selected, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these pictures have not yet been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new images are selected with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, you will only download the new images.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download or download the buttons, select a dialog with which you can select the target album, in which the pictures are discarded, displayed as usual folders. the list of existing albums can be read in the section My Albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selected the finish album, press OK, and & digiplug; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all this by using the button delete all. if you only want to delete the button, then you must select them first and then delete the deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to rebuild photos that you have deleted from the camera. so, the photos will not be deleted at the trashcan of & kde; if you want to erase your photo album. if you want to erase them from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should take it over the camera name, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as a filename for the photos frequently. the filenames are usually relegated after the photos taken from the camera. this can be useful to double filenames in the same album. therefore, it may be useful to incorporate the date and time in which the image has been made to incorporate the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for data-based underage. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created each day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three additional options, which are done before the photos on the plate are stored. if you select this, the respective entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format as the standard format, can be used for example in the editing field the prefix Photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filenames, you have the possibility to change the file name in lowercase letters. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed under the name shown in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera window for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to prepare a automatic turn during shutting. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, the picture lets you turn off. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button enlarged and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has information about the date printed on which the photo was made available, and digiplug can be used on the image data. all images with the same date will be provided in the same sub-album. all images with the same date are available. in the section sidebar Meta-Data you can read which information that your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case saves & digiplug; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change this, you must select this option and select the option Dateline-based lower at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file extensions dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digiplug; you where the images should be loaded, select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and on a map. the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a browser to another & digiplug. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users can therefore want to document the location of the photos, or simply document the location data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 is a lot of GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map referencing. there are at least three ways to get this up. directly with the correct hardware, using the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire of & digiplug can be set on this page. however, some pictures have switched on this page. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, you can only get on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can switch the tool bar when using the screen mode in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">The image and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark or bright color in the picture. these colours are specified here. in the image processing, this approach can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for close explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression approach, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. here means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option, you can compress the deflate compression salggerm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not influence the image quality as the deflate algorithm works without any loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting lossless JPEG 2000 files you can freely save. even if you select the loss of loss and file size better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but it was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default imprint is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixels at ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grate pattern using the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white comparison of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white comparison is not set. standard, it is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps will get more details into the top-lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-light, so the parts of your camera are embedded in the settings, because of the inability of your camera show the top-light in the settings. finally, you can solve the illumination in various rosatönen. lastly, you can reconstruct a few parts of the missing information from the plants.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because the blue pixels in general do not boil as fast as green and red. & Ds try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of & digiplug; however, to keep the time for the demo icing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo application algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data sensor, which have many cameras and that creates a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digig; and Dcraw have three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. according to some tests, it was produced as if AHD Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity-directed) was the first algorithm to look at the edges. Bilinear is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution to acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you are carried out during the conversion rate.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and statements as they should be given. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information as the colour information of a colour space in the others are to be translated as precisely as possible.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should be done to the camera creators and model you are using. not all profiles are based on the same type. currently, dcraw Gamma does not have to convert xcrab Gamma not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the colour mapping.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof Profile, which you can emulate as your picture of a device would be given back. this is very useful before you print image, because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can be very satisfied, instead of changing to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is foreseen for them. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the file name, current filentive, enlarging factor and current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">One menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo, before you use File Save or the button Save out of the tool bar, once you have saved the original photo, once you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly produce a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it by file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the button restore or use the button Create button restore in toolbar. you then lose any change that you have carried out on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by using editing resumressions or restored by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the key abbreviation, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -Umschage-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; click on the back bar or restore button in toolbar for a moment longer, you will select a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions will be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the photo editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation bar in the toolbar, image below or the entries in the menu. if you want to make changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">In the picture you can zoom in and zoom in to Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or use the entries in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: extension factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full-screen mode. you come in the normal view, where you do not want to use the Esc key. normally, you can use this in the set dialog by & digiplug; you can view this from the & digiplug; main window. view the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, select the image file and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the Main Menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. whole screen pages can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar at the right hand side which provides important information and promotions for selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation panels, even in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can insert or insert the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC fields to allow you to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII-characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted to other applications. if you want to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the button users or simply switch to the next picture, the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section reviews shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written into the IPTC field. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a searchbox to filtering the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with the previously used in this & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword will be adjusted dynamically to the input keyword. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is very useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of sample words in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field of Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar code is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, sampling and search settings. if in addition, one or more sampling filter is used in the right-hand side, only the interface of these two will be displayed. all configured keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull down and lay down. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. as a result there will be a dialogue that asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on one calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on no keywords, and afterwards, a keyword out of the right keyword is drawn to the selection and put down there. a dialogue is asked whether this keyword will be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also get off-off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly addressed & digicame; s more specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one sets a colorized workflow, which is the colors used by your camera or scanner. with a colour-managed workflows, you can easily print the colors on your monitor to those of your camera or scanner which you can print or publish them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you enough background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed choices to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your imagery meets all the criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufei-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom Exente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to crack my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB color space, or not, you have to crack your monitor, because sRGB controls on sRGB format, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, comparative, automatic and contrast extending from the menu to correct automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaled down the whole picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest spot so bright as possible without changing its colour shading. this feature is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparison: this method adjust the illuminative factor of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity of the image is as flat as possible. in this way, the histogram of intensity of a picture, sometimes it produces just rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which can either produce miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the entire histogrammarea.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image due to postpone of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and may be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white comparison of & digiplug came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited because of a color space can occur with 8-bit color. if you can do so far from the original image, in case you can perform the white comparison to the shell mode, which in 16-bit mode, your options are to make the correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-balance sheet which is protected by copyright Pawel T. Jochs. they start with the menu entry colors white comparison of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target machine. if you want to see the original icon again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview photos features a red marker. the Luminance of pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram will appear as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum appears. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shadow, saturation and gamma off. the shadow Justierung lets you improve the shaded details of your photos or down here.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color-temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white comparison with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of pixels is exposed. this will display the combined result in the white comparison. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the definitive image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set, you can save them in a text file and later recharge.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets sets all the filter values back to its standard values and their neutral white balance. note that neutral setting can be shown a different photo than your original. when you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the Kodierunglasses per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this encoding is also needed for high-quality images. this encoding requires only for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for use of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles, you can rate the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color Toner correction. this tool allows you to save several color channels simultaneously, so you can also use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the correct correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; Tool Farbeet, offers four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantenfilter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar, also called Sabatier, a effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure, the delicate photopapier replaced the sensitive photo light. the result was a partial negative of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible is. another raise produces a negativity scene that is not designed to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and that has been processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation that it has a stronger contrasting effect, making the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted converse color film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth imaging structure. Velvet Mediaquot; and thus, the characterize make him a film of choice for wildlife photography. Velvet Mediaquot, but also some photographers, especially for which the hardly landscapes can be used.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide readings. in big pictures the filter can lave the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to adjust the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you're satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the inverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation. even in this case you can look at them. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukstrength / contrast / gamma is the tool to improve exposure. even if the dialog appears very complicated in this tool, you need for the purposes only in the field of sliding. concrete the three slanders below the histoprogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or of selected area. under the graphs, three slurers are clicked on into it and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to use it is to move the controller and take care of it, as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand you can view the original and preview of the image. the preview is dynamically updated, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is dominated by linear or logarithmic Y-axis. images of a digital camera is often dominated by linear histogram. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic setting is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle of the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, commonly called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic calibration.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values permit the selection manual values for each area. there are also two regulators used to change the output values. for example, the compression of output values can be used. for example, the compression of output values can be used as a background while something else is visible in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Laden: these buttons can be stored in the filesystem and later reloaded again. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pallets, the inputs are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and solar tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the original image to set the histogram program for red, green, blue and luminescence channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the intervention applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated, depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify which is altered by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols can be changed between linear and logarithmic view. for images that have been recorded using a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful. in this case, the linear mode helps a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a turpax for the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones can be corresponding with darker cutouts and the image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos a red mark is visible. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, is a suitable line on this line. create a dot on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and charging: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every curve that you can have created can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp Short format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipettes automatically create the control points of the turn, middle and solar tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the Luminant canal. shadow and sun tones were applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the colorings of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you look at the relative distribution and precipitation. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison to its own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you place it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to indicate the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction will allow you to change this picture. if you are able to keep the image, the channel blender will be able to create the image of great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes visible to a visible noise caused by farbrauschen. if that is the case you can easily improve your monochrome conversion so that you can reduce the farbrauschen first in each channel.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can save you later and then load. that used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator that means you will see the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the painted picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step, since color images can be easily converted on the machine. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford's 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Grüner: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all scenarios and pushes especially good to portraits against heaven. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orangter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic ascension effects and can simulate lunar fowls at the time period. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones in the shadow of the shadow. this is very similar to the process of a print and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digiplug; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture of image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and this changed under (2). relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative setting to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not easy task. to keep his attention it is a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier for the hiring eye. under the frame, the module can be started using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired cream type for your image. through a colored line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it leaves it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value area for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">"" "" "" "this is larger with the frame and the original figure will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before used." ""</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also depends on multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply specify text, orientation, color from color space and character set with its qualities as you need. you'll simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you select for your text can be changed before you press "OK" button. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digiplug; insert templates, you can insert a template on a painting.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template applied in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format. if you want to add your template of the & digiplug; simply send us an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folders in which you have copied the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for stencils has been added, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of stencil printer. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button magnifies the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the underlying picture below. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, check the picture correspondingly smaller. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the image below. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; offers three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Defsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitization process colors with only minimum differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when colours are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequent attachment as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, frequently a camera internal sharpening has been applied. images in the raw format, however, must always be poorer during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a hot filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by using a photo using the sharpening advertising suit. that can be correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But they should be careful, however, because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the rustle. in general, you can adjust it via the menu entry. you can focus on the menu entry. under Refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to adjust the image a bit soft, is much simpler than using the menu entry. use the tool for softer with the menu entry. the thumbnail on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mascise is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the deficife mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats are generated near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is showing how many pixels are affected on each side of a sewer by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiators. therefore, they should be best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the veritable picture which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this way you can use a minimal difference in order to avoid a sewer of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft switching between the plush and hence the beauty error in faces, Himmler and water surface is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mascot filter. the original picture is the (1) and the painted picture (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool Refocussing refocuses on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the protected Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to reverse a picture & quot; this is better approach than trying to shark. this is used to use a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. it is used to use a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. you can start using a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. you can start using a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. you can start using the same technique by using color refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fender works much better than the Gauß's Faltung. this mathematical result also depends on the source pixeln, which is far influenced by the original quel pixel. the FIR Viennese inverse is affected in most cases even very strongly from remote pixels. it causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular hook: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most images the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unsharp then should pay attention to icons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can assume values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0,03. a high value will still increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. however, that the module may produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hotness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any precinct parameters will be set to you, that will be stored for later and can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all encores, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries are not immediately visible, but leave later uncertain artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp mascms produce better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically speaking, unsharp mascting must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of infinity. for the Wiener filter it can never be at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better at processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filtering, on a small non-focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the methodology in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator pains the defsharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinplate allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark eyes, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The Tool Image correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can also use the tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even homogenous regions smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should be given so that no sharpening should be ordered retroactively. please note that the detailed posture always should be subordinated in the correctness.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly throughout all directions, while a value is near to 1 just in one direction. if you have a high value of wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are given best in a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p then define the relative smoothness. therefore, use this value for the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is related to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is exposed, because it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoil effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will go through. usually, 1 or 2 is normally enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle progress da [5, 90]: angular integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is choosen too small, it should also be chosen too small. make sure that small angles do a long term. so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale step span [0,1, 10]: integrational stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more about quality you will receive by selecting this option is only low. but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button departure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors have been removed with small artifacts. the module is taken on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact that caused by a bad film storage that the original image has been caused under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; lowering is a very powerful tool to reduce image robes. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensations from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of made images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">Pictured above shows a typical scene that was taken with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grains of noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the sub-window settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can shift the picture above the picture and the color in it gets glazed and therewith smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge of the filter. this value sets the pixel pitch into place. if it is increased, smokers can adjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or dirt takes place again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or smokers can occur. if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts, you want to lose without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illumination tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the intolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically more potable to increase. however, it also contaminated the shadowy areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, rushing and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. he can remove prey and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and Laden: these buttons are used exactly to this. all parameters for reducing the lowering that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected (2). the prereduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to diffuse the image a bit soft, is fortunately much simpler than a picture to shark. use this tool to soften with the menu entry. the thumbnail on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's, film licensed, scratches, compression, compression, and local errors as well as the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colouring and texturing. the texturing is done with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrei and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduces: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it produces some compresses & quot; - small standards that are visible in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. so, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Down below, you can reduce your photo with a smooth robbery. the module is used on a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that has been viewed using a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by the ScannerLighting and photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos that were protected by a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw material photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression may have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; light Pixelquot;. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will display automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to detect the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark picture to the correct picture. please note that the Wizard is reviewing the last dark picture and automatically recharges this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result. the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all locations.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to polate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: there is an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be used to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). they are then used to polate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pixelblock are preferred to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim) which is then used to intervene in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to charge a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which is then used to intervene in block pixel.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel-Correction on a color picture, taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetion correction is a tool for correct the fitting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the middle and large photo format, can frequently light up the entire sensor range. instead & quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by allowing the light to reduce the sensor there. telefacts show this behavior also.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the BlendenFilter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should use, also with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise impair effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and grey fuses of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter. the tool Vignetanimal measure turns the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetum correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of biggest density the filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, which means an optical filter with a blade setting of 2, entspricht.Increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vignetport, reduce it to a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstarch, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetum correction reduces the illumination of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to add a more subtle re-adjustment of the target image, you can set the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma-zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetum correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the original image in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a lamp and contraction correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but laugh at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The body-efficient Grades corrects the remote corners to the second ridge. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, toned-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values hoverted distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion. this value counteracts strongly to the edges as in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners Parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and thereby carries a correction first degree through. negative values may enlarge the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filtering settings, illustrated in the dialog with a preview of Projecting correction. the values you use for your picture will be saved and the next startup is used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or hoveric correction should be done before all encores or size changes. preferably, you perform this correction as all of the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then carry out a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you can find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. afterwards, you can fix the tonn- / vercraft-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">"" "when you correct a hovertible distortion, the resulting image black corners will be removed. you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu. you can remove this slide from the image processing or using the" "" "Zoom" "" "mode." ""</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonsilly correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from the front, frames and paintings, is to correct all angles in the image of 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonsilly correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGure.org website under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust two parameters of screening and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulators may simulate the grains texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controls changed the amount of film grain and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows will white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmic filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the image under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter filmmaker is an easy to use tool to reproduce movies on your pictures. this is of classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to enhance sensitivity of the films.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, the view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body. if you need more grains to ISO-2400 if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the screening effect on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that used (2). the used film sensitivity was ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and style are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five out. thicker brush are better for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the hingness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing size is marked with the (2) image size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth. 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intrantness gradients. the lines whose gradient is slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would have good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a range of 1 to 100 in order to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal vent filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filters engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important on content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by distorted effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by acuity effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Imsharpness: wipes the image along sterning lines going out of a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unsharpness: wipes the image by rotating the pixels around a centre. this simulates the imbalance of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: wipes the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharpness: wipes the image by horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photo shooting, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnkey unsharpness: wiping the image soft to the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütt-sharpness: wipes the image by random shift in pixels and simulates the imbalance of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent impetus: finds the color paddling in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool for doing raindrops to your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a great look. it uses a protected algorithm to use Pieter Voloshyn protected by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows you to change the size of the drip. as the size of the image is not used automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size of the drops. the number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of the droplets on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose between & digiplug; image processing is free of shelves. use the selection tool to select the area, for example a face that should remain free. if you start the filter, the area will remain free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filtering. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the painted picture (2) points a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it through mirrors or rotating in the right direction. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers rotating or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you invent a picture and how can you invent a picture? how can you invent the missing information? how can you invent the missing information? how can you invent the missing information here? the CImg algorithm can be used here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size using the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target value. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">To change the size, a linear interpolation method uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixel. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain the aspect ratio: if enabled, the size of the size is retained when setting up the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is related to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is exposed, because it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turkey effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as well as loading will be used exactly. any adjustment for photo can be stored as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast on what it does, but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of the photo bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly used operation, but also a often underrated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pick up the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you are moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview as your photo after cutting-cutting area. you can change the size of the cut area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you're satisfied with the random icon, use the button The Add-button of image processing in toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file save or save file in the menu to save the newly added picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the scope of view, you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool to cut aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in the format, the larger value of height and in the landscape is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool fits according to aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, incur or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog, you can set the Max. ratio button to cut on the maximum possible mode, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation, place.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the default values, these settings are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will be reflected and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of assembling aid allows you to blend Help, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonical divides are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-term rule, harmonical triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangle.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre. a composition that usually follows is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you compose a picture. these aids are mentioned below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"" "the Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-term rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition is the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flux." ""</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral. these rectangles are used to produce the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be in the focal point of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can be simply because of being without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Tritriangles are also derived from the above mentioned golden spiral. in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a uniangled triangle. diagonals on these lines can place a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame in order to place your frame of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">"" "" "" "the Horizontal mirror reflect and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonic stages." ""</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to fix the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are shot at an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose the Free rotation and adjust the target range.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slipcase are specified in degrees. with the button presets you can reset the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line to position the two lines. after you move it on an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is the function transformation process cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">Option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. however, consider the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed District.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed district.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes on the corners. one way to detach this is to cut the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">This tool is used to shift part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no turning, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformers Scheren.</seg>
<seg id="679">Push your image by using horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will appear to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help become a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the line tool to adjust the image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having conducted the shear, the picture will get caught a bit. for a single donation, this effect is usually neglected, but two swords produced twice as much as devastation and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After placing the picture, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of images with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a spare file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that have been included in the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, the coordinates are carried out in red. GPS Spurdata are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera data must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera ness. is the deviation below which data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate to all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have a suitable data. if you know that in reality, location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is located, you can put this limits here and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialogue can use the coordinates using a call to the next notice, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and increase it. in addition, choose the region concerned and increase it. you must always be selected again until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the amount must always be selected manually. the card can be manually changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG coding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG coding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG-Video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packets of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slides.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled on the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select the DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the disc DVD / XVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures you have to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can start the module with Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be chosen from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step you should specify a picture in seconds. the speed of image transfer is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt you should set them black. you can choose the name and path of the generated file, under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">In case you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start the production of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer, you can drink a coffee quickly or in all the rest of your computer, and enjoy the slides, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the button settings bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows several images to print on a sheet of paper. the combined images can also be printed automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. original version of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversions process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings will be used for the white comparison. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion may be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can save one of the three output formats and save the conversion outcome. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have preferred to process your images, or you will not be able to use the JPEG format because it only permits a limited number of operations before the picture quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are more adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use it again.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. if you are sure, for example, by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single pictures. however, they have the possibility to overwrite an existing file. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview of progress is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">"" "this module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix to start the grid and the timestamp of the item." ""</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the image size from the ImageMagick package. you can make the picture smaller or enlarge. these are four types of picture change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, chosen. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background colour, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images added. more images can be drawn to the list of images added and down there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After starting the module, the images window will be displayed with you from pre-elected images. add a picture to the selected images. for the last selected image, a preview on the right-hand side will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and original files in JPEG format, then the original exifications details will be added to sentimed images.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures after certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, Jesper, however, Anne Helene is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photophotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather try to try features, you have the following alternatives to this guide:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screen photos and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & chephoto album; and in the first dialogue you start with the demo, if you & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or pick up the menu entry in photoalbum; then you can download some sample images and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & Photophotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name implies, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>

<seg id="917">& Photophotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML Web pages with your pictures. the one is available in & photoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, you can create in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create about the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be shown on the viewing page. check out information about the export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select what information can be displayed on the HTML pages. so you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer. for example, all images are exported. you can't use this setting so that you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain views.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can set how the HTML pages should look like. most adjustment possibilities are unique, so that it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. by this, those need to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more pictures download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if it wants to see a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, you specify the different folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best choose a basic folder for all of your HTML files, and each subsequent proposition is a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folders in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and next time you can specify a folder, or a folder with a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they are all displayed for viewing. if you select any URL, after the pages have been created, the URL that you can define here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files created by you will not have to copy them manually. so that the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folders in which all subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described setting options have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will set, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & chePhotoalbum; you may need to use a HTML page for viewing the pictures, you may need to use a HTML page for viewing the images, reception location, etc., you must do with & chephoto album; you do not even have this job again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Photophotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others to your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it, whether the images are stored in the file or whether you can put all images into the file. the advantage of all images into the file can be stored so independently. however, this obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can import a .kim file from the menu Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, it will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches for the pictures, which are in the file of the .kim file. if the images are not found in the file of the .kim file, the images of the URL, which you have specified in creating the HTML files, this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for exporting images will be described, which you can export about the "Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to deal with internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you have to copy Manually near the .kim file you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the Automatically into the .kim file to copy and copy your photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures already have been compressed with JPEG image and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not worthwhile to compress the files. if you still want this, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximale image size. if you want to send images to your friends, you might want to limit the images in full size, as the .kim file would be very large, for example, you can limit the size by using the maximum of 800 pixels high and its size.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu, select your photo album; the exported database is described as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard for importing is made of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personified the category individuals of the saved file personer (if you are a domain), while this category is called in your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog window which are to be imported into the third dialog boxes and which categories will match these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can get the categories of importing file with the categories of your current database. an example for this you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch pictures: if you see images, you often want to watch images within different picture groups and watch mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps of (1) capture the information about your pictures, via (2) the search and view, go to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your images. but it has been extended and now also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about images, but often they also include videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Photophotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice, i.e., Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Photophotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and used to record them in future starts. if you want to read another database with images, you can start & chephoto album; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up in a window with which you can change the settings of & Photophotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can view six different symbols, with which you can view the previewing options and options for viewing. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described to you how to set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Please see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete members groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle class as declared.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setting options available, which you want to set up the list of members. in the list, select the category which you want to configure. in the left window of the list, a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modulation system with other graphic applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. please click on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the modules. the modules can be read and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can call through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with several applications, it can be tested that the modules have been tested with & a photoalbum; therefore, you should use new modules first with the demo database before using the command &gt; Photophotoalbum Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu Help. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photophotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications, which is also able to use KIPI, is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order doesn't support the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & chephoto album; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & playphoto album, the modules have to pass a list of albums. this is a photo album and a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & drop photoalbum; s browsing the contents of a category, for example, each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you use the category individuals, so do if you have chosen people to view and share this on the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are installed with & photoalbum; you can remove these from the list of modules. then start the settings dialog, and select the modules that modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a starting screen when you start & chephoto album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to see it from any other KDE application, you'll see the window with which you have entered the picture above. at the moment, you will not see any information about your images. in the section, you will not see any information about your images. in the section, you will not see any information about your images. in this section, please click on the picture gallery, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any image with remarks. this includes information about the people taken on the picture, where the image has been taken either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time. if shown on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen were taken.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in section. if you want to see these notes, if you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists using a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & chePhotoalbum; as you can always use it again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following idea is based on the shifting of images within the list: if you are for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures, the same 5-10 people are depicted, so that the names used to be moved up above are able to find them faster and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting off date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotation for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the preview of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, recorded then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture, you see a browser window that shows the US as a group. in order to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the dialog box, it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new overcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry into a category and place there in order to sort this entry into an subcategory. please note that you just sort your categories in alphabetically. see.</seg>

<seg id="981">You can also show up a frame completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then click on the window. see this in the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or any images if you don't have a filter. for example, you can view the size of the thumbnails, by simply downwards pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on your desktop background, this picture is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to erase and press in the Edit menu. now the window is shown you can see in the picture.</seg>

<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy them from the folders and copy them again. if you want to avoid trouble if you want to avoid the merge of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy you want to filter out the pictures so that you may see for others unaccessible in the menu. alternatively, you may also view all the images that your little sister may see, contests and select the menu entry All out of current view.</seg>

<seg id="1021">If you process a texture or texture of a texture, you can see a preview of your self-view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview of the self-definition view and a small example of the scene is rendered using the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture will be selected (for example a texture within a texture-map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>

<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store several window directives and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the temptation to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the temptation to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>

<seg id="1039">Any root mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the donated picture. if you only want to renders a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section to render into input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination quality you can select the features that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple paint and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the rationales can be found in the user handbook to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray pixel, different errors may occur. these images have often not displayed a moirè pattern or pattern effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are displayed smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature better look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, computed and connects & Povray; more than one ray pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because every pixel is further divided and adaptively because the recursion results are depending on the calculated colours.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference is calculated on a certain number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth of a certain number of pixels with super sampling, a grid of 4x4 is calculated on a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixels in 4 sub-pixels are shared separately, and the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted to the depth of depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the racing is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse of light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be computed by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams had no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>

<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & colpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply drag the source code in the editor and drag him to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also paste.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is renounced. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catching of the points on the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the switches separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values provide an accurate wire model, and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the detailed press for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the high detailed valuation for extended projections, all the camera features an advanced projection screen. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is hidden behind the objects. the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor underneath the objects are being rendered. the ground is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the shutting mode, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering scenes. you can adjust values for depth and swelling. in section Render modes you will find in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window directives or create new window directives. in section window directives will explain how to create and store window directives.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Standard window rules: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-hand window directives shows all existing window directives. a new arrangement can be created with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window order. new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with hatches you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and oblique on the view does not appear in the main window, but produces a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installs and now you want to start with no precise knowledge of the two programs. if you can create all steps in this guide, you should enjoy the ultimate but simple scene, very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that you are using only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't have a camera, no rules for rendering users can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything wrong, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation, so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should know the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view from the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the results of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the content of the object properties that find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, but please note that the camera in the view has control points, with which you can change the camera's target on one control point and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user button or press it, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result they look the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene, for example, insert a crossbar (insert end body loaders) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the button User. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the plain, although at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you want to watch out the object tree, you will see that you can click on the object + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon, just allow you to get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to place its material properties. there are many different materials, but in the moment you choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog, where you can select, as the object is to be inserted. please select your first object. the pigment is then changing in the object tree. you can see the name in your self-definition view (name = soil pigment), with one click on the button preview, as the pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the Pigments will only need to enter a matt black material, because you always have to enter the pigment's look at any time with a click on preview. also give you the colors to the pigment. again, there are many possibilities now, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the slide and ball in the preview, click on the button User and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color you need. here you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board colour list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each color and change the colors in the field of object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you have the basic working mode of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood. the ball can be just as easy as the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the button or button users. otherwise, the ball will float above the ground, as you have moved down the ground by one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering is now a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click "Ball Pigment, then select" "" "Color" "" "and set the values as follows:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the paste button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings splendor effect and reflection revealed some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is an Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracts a scene, the rendering of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that will render the scenes) through the objects and how atmospheric effects are reflected in the scene, and as atmospheric effects as for example, the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye when you look at the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be looted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual fildialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously prepared with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already stored the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you must type a name and memory.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reproduced in the last stored version. all changes have been rejected since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you haven't stored any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last updated command. this menu entry may only be used, if you have used editing them.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can type a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for setting up & cpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard abbreviation. you can change or add new commands to this option for & cpovmodeler; -commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to create the tool bars. you can add and remove the tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove them.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to detect rough surfaces without modeling on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then be processed further to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, using a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& snickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in your own window in size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1179">The button help starts the KDE Help with the & skanite; manual. the button Over starts the KDE dialog for & skanlite;. the button settings dialog shows the dialog for the settings and closing arguments to finish & skanlite.</seg>
<seg id="1180">& skanlite; is licensed under the GPL and the libksane Library, used by & skanlite; under the GPL. warning: libsane is licensed under the GPL with an exception.</seg>
<seg id="1181">& Amarok; used like all other programs keys-shortcut. below you can set up a list of these abbreviations and their function. the global keyhole you can set up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and select the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as & Amarok; -Shortcuts will work. thereby you make your keyboard to & Amarok; -Control Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarook has many general functions, which are usually used in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browsers, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, and scripts; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check your script if all required modules are available and use cdialog for the user to see why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin 'corundum' Resulum error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebinding V3.4 is REQUIRED for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / Templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions. they will quickly realize that writing of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with amarok. the simplest way is the use of command dcop; which should be attached to each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages facilitate executing external programs and commands. this way the function exec () can be used mostly. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts will regularly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should also ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to view the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data each script must take care of each script. if a script is launched, Amarok sets the file folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script might now be & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integrating between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuclicked: submenu itemTitle - Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be identified, so that the script can be used to create an own entry. in order to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amaroilpite (submenu itemTitle) to remove one entry again dcop Amaroscript removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & when the user stops a script, or when the user stops a script, send SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. storage work. for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with the Extended amarocscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main kript must be executable (+ x), the rest of the modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts side of & Amarok; for your entry to kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features, and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can easily move music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you are looking for a quite certain title out of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting browsers and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then, the playlist is just right for you. and if the decision is still hard to choose, the dynamic mode and the smart playlist will automatically choose the right music according to specific criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarook has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used as you want to listen to your music. Amarook is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Normally, you have to enter the folder folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automaker, you should not compile any difficulties when compiling any problems. if you encounter any problems, please report it in the & kde; Mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok, like most applications, has some options that can enable or disable compiling time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies have to be fulfilled, so that they can be used. for details, see section System Requires.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should not use full use.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; without effort you set up on the setup dialog. the setup dialog has multiple cartridges to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Player windows include the player window in addition to the playlist, or out. if the option is switched off, the playlists window will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Mood barometer: this feature is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar. the option switches the experimental function of the mood.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Voting full: this feature is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. thus, the used color scheme for the mood barometer is altered.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Music files can be compiled in case of music files. if this setting is activated, .mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files are stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; (normally ~ / .kde / share / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser needs to be launched by & Amarok; if a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers are using: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Playlist to save, save the current playlist automatically at the end of & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist when you don't want to lose the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths to manually stored playlists: if you activate this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use the absolute position of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The single piece of play make visible, that the playlists window will show up / off, to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context of the context, it automatically displays the context-browser, once the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The section shows you & Amarok; s appearance. the section is part of three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of various fonts in & Amarok. by marking of Own Scriptures, the otherwise gray-set menu is enabled. you can select fonts for the following areas: playlists, Player window and context-browsers. if you select..., you can select a font from the select dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection of custom colour scheme you have the source of choice and set your own color scheme. use it with it's activated colour selection for front and background colour.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback will continue to start playing, that & Amarok. after the program start, playback will automatically continue with the piece, which it has been stopped at the last evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The An On-Screen display window allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is checked, a preview of OSD is displayed, and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is font. click here to select... to select the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow ensures that the text is shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Our own colours use the option to adapt the OSD colours for writing and background. a click on the color selection opens onto the color selection. when used colors do not use, the default & kde are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The input text display provides the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholder and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen display is intended for Xinerama users. thus, you can define on which screen a multi-monitor environment is to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down selector. some drivers enable additional adjustment possibilities in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used for setting all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders chosen, the & Amarok; according to music files. to purchase a folder in addition to its name. this section includes also check boxes for adjusting, such as with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolder to search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Modifications: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders chosen on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted), and an incremental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Playlists import: causes & Amarok; all found playlists in your collection files (.pls and .m3u files) added to your collection. the automatically added playlist will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part Collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection. the combination driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySQL. if MySQL is selected, another setup will be needed in the subwindow MySQL device.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySQL device section will be used to set up the database for & Amarok; using the computer screen, on which the MySQL database is located. afterwards, under port: the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is made.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The flashcard last.fm supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces on a last.fm server and create music recommendations on the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your user name and password for your last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send off pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Similar performers abdicate: after activation of this setting, a list with similar interpreters to the played play can be heard. note: you can see the list in the context-browser. note: you do not need to use last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix Systems (like & b; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok requires only the kdelibs package and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs so installed (including those included programs, as & Amarok; needed some of them to be found e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small manual on how to minimize cdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD are predicting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. we try to prepare Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library for days. you can relocate the file by typing in ~ / .kde / share / paste / Amarok / collection _ scan.log and hang also the captured file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib as reading the meta-information from this file system crashing. please report these errors to the Taglib developer from bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is slightly more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of them have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has compiled but with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crash when editing the Meta-Information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off, if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or do not use at least a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace to us by e-mail (the email opens automatically at a crash). if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in Meta-Infos, but this is not as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0]; use MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($argv [0]); my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag; print" "" "$MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag, amp; UTF8);" ""</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be installed with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) can be easily forgotten in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bugs in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes, you can see the status disabled in grey and semi-transparent. note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this adjustment shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this mistake: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok is the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which catocapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are the easiest way by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or by developers. use this forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please only wear a bug if there is something on the limit of a bug in Amarok yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist will appear. how do you get music pieces there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start window into the statistic window was converted into the statistic window.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, you have to specify the evaluation column in the playlist and select the evaluation column. click anywhere in the new application column, to specify the review on a piece. you can also use the Shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, and then press release on your keyboard. or click the right mouse button to select, and then select from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Draw a playlists file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there, just as you would do it with other files. that's how easy it is: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar of the playlist, right next to the Add-button, you can save the playlist. click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Probably the program XMMS-config is missing. install the XMMS-devel package and install Amarok; new. also look for libations, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; used by a backend independent approach, so the actual question is that Gstreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / KDEmm?. as you see, we support pretty much every conceivable audio format. GStreamer can even code text and pNG decode!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It can be! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which will be provided by default no MP3 decoder (from patented legal reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST online update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & Amarok; play MP3's off: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-Sink, the device must be provided with a mixer. this can be done by a sound card using the same time and simultaneously. this can be done by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and help a solution. for GStreamer you might need to specify another sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This is done so. do not forget that media need to be decoded first. GStreamer is the best choice if you are looking for a deor with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and send the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, as well as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable the sound server with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of FAQ!). make sure that the swabs SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause stacked playback. read this error report. read the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead of GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably you use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver was greatly optimised for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound, sound system. the smaller the buffer. yes, this is a mistake, please help us to fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, rushes & Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer you must register all the components. run GST register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask the IRC channel # gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit anok previously!): - Download ffmpeg file, compile and install it. then delete the module folder with GST-config / gstreamer-config (you will find the module folder with GST-config / gstreamer-config) and run GST register again. start now & Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is as many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the Kdcop command line program, or the same thing more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the accompanying programs will give you a preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; you must make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have in common, supports & k3b; mostly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef ChateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef ChateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef ChateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef ChateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef ChentProject () DCOPRef ChentProject () void of the void Cdrw () void conatdvd () void convolatdvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively one can get a project about the command line using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurl (KURL:: List URLs, QString parent) void enameItem (QString path) void removeItem (QString path, QString newName) void tsumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioe; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; files in WAV files on the hard disk) and of many co-codes that support these WAV files (lossless compression) as standard. other coils may still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD are read, read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD;, is used by & kaudiogens; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this has not yet been installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggpre (for OGG) or other coachers have already been installed, so it is highly likely to be compiled for any Linux distributions. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation will not be needed.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Code is a small introduction about Kodierer, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (the setup dialog may be called up to a suitable configuration), after the daily handling of a & CD; this leads to the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) for an understanding of the slender approach of the user interface that you often stumble on at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setting dialog of & kaudiogrammes, with different flashcards (like Encoder, for arranging the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coachers and compression ratios, helping you in choosing the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both encoders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, it's still delivered with most distributions for free, but there are open licence questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High until very high output quality (with high bitrates) but compared to OGG lightly deeper quality for deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recording devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for the music of youths, portable devices and autostereossystems. but not good enough for hifi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand / used with & kaudiolies and the co-ererprogram to create the folder and file names and the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codierprograms, there is often a combination of program settings for the coachers and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodierern explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) to add when MP3s will be coded with lame and the title parameter of & kaudiolies; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiolies; parameters that can be used (= button name in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database that can download / enter the information so that all the others can download / enter the information rather than yourself. it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the translation) is not an attorney. however, no one can issue that you are publicly available on the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither artists nor the music can be hurt by a & CD; business, physical or virtual, can be preserved anyway.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiodrome; is actively used to select a check box (sending an address). in this kind of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (but it can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioxx; used to use freeDB, the geographical server should be used at the next level. this saves bandwidth from the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of reflections for the online call of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly generated) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that uses cdparanoia; those who want to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs; s. to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the right distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the saved WAV files, the encoders and therefore the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossable compressing for audio data) can be added to the setup of the Kodierers. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package must be installed from the relevant linux distribution, before the coachers can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codiers. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter of Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like lame-help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device number of the device number of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to retrieve both programs with a command line in one terminal. this might give a reference to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a step by step-by-step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsafe to do anything? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; read about MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. in any case it is not necessary to compile a search engine. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source file, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have screaming about it (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & kaudiolies; something which is thought to be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD, which must be repeated for any read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the decompression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). if we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to use the freeDB to download the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them in any outreading of a & CD; once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation is delivered to the program reading, so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or when more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / frod and an attempt with the there available entries of the device designations for CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of general settings. here you do not get much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything will be loaded / typed as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if inappropriate information can be requested, so that you will be informed when information about the witness of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card box CD; simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically can be downloaded via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while using the Internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection range is easier, becomes a & CD; associated with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filenames or tag entries, can be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, you can use freeDB locally in the offline mode, if you want to download the database before. however, if you want to use the database before. however, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first one. mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeDB for us. these are settings for the data-enquiry, for retrieving & CD; information from freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system learn how to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. use everything as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site freedb.org and look at a mirror-server near you. on this path the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server as though, as many firewalls date the protocol 8880 defaults, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transfer and transfer data to the freeDB server. the first check box should turn off.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your machine)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: when you cross this, then / must be specified in which the WAV files can be specified. if only space is available on another drive, the files will not be checked in the private folder. don't forget it if you want to make this folder with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All so enter as it is on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something has to be blinded to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo equipment. the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of generating tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be erased in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic set of & kaudiogens. this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wise, you never have to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure is described and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from freeDB to pick up. the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any inconclusive & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, displays the screen photos a bit differently than that for a & CD; you'll learn the & CD; data manually enter, instead of retrieve them from the web. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; identifies and can be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, search for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up by the freeDB, all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are also displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database record that your opinion matches best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query from freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can also manually release this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 2: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo, the title of the piece in the first line of the "Current title ', the rest of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist must not be entered in the" "" "Current title" "" "field, unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiacell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editors, so that you are not only starting with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiolies; this option is set up in the section encoding settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all co-makers and file formats. see the help of the Kodiers to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obviously inaccurate with the style of the chosen CD; this is not important, since we do not transfer the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap to find below Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data, which we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the book's items. simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typed all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed over the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button All pieces select at the lower edge of the screen to select all the pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "by clicking on the button select the reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. this allows to read out and coding parallel. please note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program is not found to suppress this behavior. the only thing configurable to submisuse this behavior is unclear. the machine used with a amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order in the queue of the Kodierers is. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window appears.</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu. it appears the usual file-dialog, with which help you choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & Conqueror; -window to the & kmid; -window will also work with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry slot from the menu or create the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the & kmid; (with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then play one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button, and drive with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or slowly playing, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the tempo Display, and so you can change the speed of the temp. to re-click the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar or select the menu entry in the menu, interrupts playback. enter the space bar while not playing, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in a music piece. some pieces use text installment, others use lyrics, others use lyrics. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & Cmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined to set up a song, so you'll need to manually setup the Karaoke text, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the entries text and lyrics. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that allows you to summarize. this section shows how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find this in the menu collection under the point organization.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the preferred footprint in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song in the collection manager. in turn, the file dialog appears where you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the option auto add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding is added to the collection, a piece can be added to the active collection by opening (using File Open or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied at opening. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on them.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the sub-menu game sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select any random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the record previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection box and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is stored at the leaving of & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are non-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Type Change Patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change Patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including AWE and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file of your hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. the requirement for that is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that one section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail, so that I can be in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are non-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM Patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all tones that use this instrument (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a rifle supplement. to do this, you can do the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (fabric shooting) it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, with which each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and does not represent the pitch of the tone of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sound on the Perkushima channel. take a look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchanging the first and second channel, simply make it easy to use in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, assembled according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is used on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must of course be defined forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the ussionist patch on the Perkushima channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch BenetRatio in which relation to Pitch Bender's events will be multiplied by it. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender Event with the value n, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to make no decimal definitive in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM exists that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch tool with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards do not need to play higher on your keyboard. in order to get the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of claviatures (one for every MIDI channel). on these claviatures, you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the button doesn't display green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (now) has two different views to display the played notes. view the Settings menu under the Point Canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed on which a song is played, the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the speed, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, such as a music piece has to be played. it contains the same MIDI file to perform very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have it done, because & kmid; without AWE support you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed that it supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror; select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before you check the option auto add to the collection. otherwise the files will be added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double the arrow button on the left of the Tempin LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; Desktop an & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way I want to play a file (when I play a karaoke file) or play a file, only in the & Conqueror; change the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding it to a collection, turn the option Automatic Add to collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection added by files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. just want to play the first file only. so, if you want to add automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this an MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or the postcard, encourage me to program further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I have not much time to take for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, a bug or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge delight, if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to receive a MIDI file, then you should contact me when I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; I have completely written down in my spare time and I'll point out that I am only going to programer because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameters MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will run as if you could have a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andselectable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed if there is information in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to select the preferred connections below the bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy stage. if you find an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the arranged entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct the editing of XML configuration files. of course, one can only do it if & kmplayer, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category clicks, therefrom the menu view and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the Edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode or a different group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and loading can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / kmplayable and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 observer option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer / intro.xml / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate through opening another source. however, this would end at the end of animation, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; smiles; & lt; bodybuilding; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodybuilding; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; In the source package of & kmplayer; are supported in the directory / some examples of SMIL the of & kmplayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer to configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here, the edition of mplayer is evident.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplaywc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swappradec mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages it is necessary to play the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog box of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is well known in a consoles and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a pre-given baking for a particular Mime type is taken (of course only if this was also determined), it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplaywc. for example, phonon all ogg files will be used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked, this will be used to use the used device and the TV channels. this can be used manually from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) the dialog in the kmplayer is to use the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports to be selected (for example, it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB package.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer only can use XVideo (probably this kind of playing video devices (probably the only one that works). this is why the videoforlinux extension works for the X server. therefore, for the XFree86 server, it is necessary to include the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentary, this dvdnavsource, tvdsource, tvées, tvées, source-source, source-source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Can there be hints as I can make my CDROM drive when I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is run as user root after installing the device. it is absolutely sure that / dev / cdrom drive onto the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly but why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1765">When using the rack-search, the elements of the DVI; -file is clicked on an item in DVI; -file was clicked on an item in the & latex; source code was clicked on. once upon a section in & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding site is executed in DVI; viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used with multiple files. using a Master document, working with other embedded .tex files will be simplified using the project. using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick structure: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File access: in this mode, the DVI cable -file is called "" "" -file "" "" and there is no call to & eyepiece; after the quick assembly. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1769">Looking at the Edit tool bar, the three large numbers should be used for the rapid integration of common elements into the document. the first selection range is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection range further is available for items such as tags, joints, or references. the available toll options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Designation: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for the reference to a fixed name (selective selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a list of selections is displayed with literary entries. for the editing of & BibTex; files are necessary Editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bib; -files can also be written in & colile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selector with the name GrÃ ¶ nā is used for defining the font name. it can be set up for the main text, the share of joints, etc., the following font names are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & colile; two selection options are available for publication: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and set of settings. 2. the document can be written down by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets in accordance with the command\\ 'folder class set the settings for command. (12pt]) defines the font. if the font has been set up, it can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the building and the button of bone.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & cile; will automatically remove the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, should be searched for errors. when using quick assembly & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the log should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font names have been created. the command\\\, {environment},\\ Huge and\\ the {environment} needs to be found in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The result is only valid within the environment (from\\) to {environment} up to\\, {environment}. there is no coating (number) for public depreciation within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to view the readability and usability of the document. for example, it can be added certain fonts, grease, italic pressure, underlining, etc., or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'always {emph}: this command is for the cursive strength and is long as long as it is closed, until it is closed with a\\ to {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. quotation begins with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\ to {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; recording language is represented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & colile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a little text has been entered, a few customization for the better reading of the document should be completed. a quotation, a few spots in the fat and cursive printing and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be turned back to the editor via Editor-View or Ctrl (with an external viewer). from an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document may print out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a remote file format (engl. D e V ice I n). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi issue such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -conversion or computer imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1790">To print a & DVI; file is the same steps as for creating the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, you can print the document using the print (in the viewer) (if the printer is correctly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is capable of converting DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion may start in the tool bar in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The priority claim to meet the direct jump from the editor to an open position within DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& hurry; offers a corresponding attitude for all & latex; -binary files. this only needs to set up Modern unter Settings Kile... tools for building-balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To locate the stock search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and click on advance search. the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI; viewer will then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; document the corresponding & latex file in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & cile; open and set to the appropriate lines. this text must be set as text editor (Settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should using quick assembly of the & DVI; viewer cannot be able to reveal a bug. if an error occurs, it will be shown in the log file, or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file contains the error source in source code. in the editor, the buttons will always appear on the error in which the error appears. in order to see the incorrect line, the error message must be clicked on the error, and & colile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the tool bar, a window to select the template appears for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document may either be rewritten or rewritten to the quick creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Controlled users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be created in & cile; created, stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document easier.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file has to be created or create a new file. & cile; can create a new template by offering an existing document and selection of File presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some string labels will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">In creating the own template, it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, they will be used as follows:\\ 'documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the help of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, its own template instead of the standard must be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will be created a simple way to create a template, should be searched one in the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers to read and emphasis on many different types of text files (including also latex; and & BibTex;). many editings for & Kate; can be done directly in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate and Kate; and to learn about Kate, the Handbook should be attracted to Kate. users of & hurry, can get there directly with reading the chapter of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& hurry; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called for the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a useful description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; you can find them as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with buttonter Ctrl key to extract the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\ has been selected for\\ or\\ any.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with a painted linker button, the chosen text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated conversion, parts of the source code will be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& hurry; has the ability to browse the different types of source codes and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include ski jump placements. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. this ski stamp is emphasized, so that this ski stamp is highlighted so that it will automatically be used in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; important functions are added in & Cauex; important functions for the writing of a & latex; source codes are added; special commands for their selection. under Edit Advices, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Will have a complete paragraph (group of lines containing on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning is not included in this text, such as tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only inventive cause in & colile; is thus that the sum of the text is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word is under the current cursor position. this choice also has an extended meaning, since this command is also possible & latex; commands to an extra star (\\) and an extra star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To listen to a part of the document may be removed naturally and by pressing the key Entf. & Kate; offers the key signature Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. under editing are the following commands to remove the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & colile; is included in the description to do installation.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & hurry; add more commands to edit environment for a fine, simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to join the close.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ 'environment}, becomes the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">During the input of many shattered environment commands, this command can quickly become lost. this command includes the last open environment, so that the reversing of the ambient conditions will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. under Edit Tex Group are a few key commands that correspond to the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is speckled in the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the resulting clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is speckled in the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is curated before or behind the hulled clamp of a & tex; Group #, will be injected at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many welded groups parentheses can be quickly lost to the view. this command completes the last open group, so that the disachute structure of the & tex; groups cannot be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two easy insertion signs are used in & colile; the sign "is used in & cile; the sign" is used for two easy insertion signs. "& hurry; know this case and for two close mounting signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic add-up of the double click mark can set up under settings Kile... LaTeX and will come out.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also possible settings (for example, ngerman or French) and so German or French hostnames are used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">During the shift of Shift; input & cile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), it is not only a row change but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a Tables environment, the current line with\\\\ has a close closing time.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & cile; is intelligent enough to emphasize the default & latex; - or user-defined environments. set up these can be added to Settings... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users can assign the columns to tables and thereby rearrange all Et-signs (amp;) to each other. if this tabulator is not the door to be added; however, this tabulator is not the added, for the columns of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; it has already been a good source code completion, it has been added to & kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;) it has been expanded to automatically set up different modes. all these modes can set up for different ways of working under settings Kile... Verily set up.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When beginning a new environment with the command\\\ 'environment}, & hurry; automatically add the command\\ to {environment} into an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the key bar is removed, the last letter of input is removed and thus, the list can be reduced to the complete list. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump-stamps can be found, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible, and the desired parameters can be collected then.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings; set up... kile; you can set up your attitudes to these lists. you can learn different Wages for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as to be washed out of the general language-used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not enough for the completion of environments. however, it is always used to specify a few letters with\\\ 's. on the other hand, the command will be used so often that & cile; a special mode for completion of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the fullscreen mode the menu will be automatically added to the menu or the keys to fill the environment automatically and it appears\\ '. afterwards, the environment can be made to the simplest way and can be finished by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is done, the environment will be closed automatically. once & hurry; know that it is a list of lists, it is even a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings, set up... kile; you can set up settings on these lists. this mode uses the desired list of the installation mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& hurry; supported custom lists of decreasing cuts, which are set up immediately by lacks to set up strings. as an example of a remote panel, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, is contained L =\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word has been done through the menu item Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large windows are not helpful for automatic loading. however, it has been found that many wanted to be written in a document more than once. thus, & hurry; the fuller is already written for everyone already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up a cile in the menu of Settings... Cile refusing. here, the swelling value can also be specified for the display of the fulfilment.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for public depreciation and re-ordinances of pages. if the PDF output is installed, the PDF-edition is rearranged and then to be converted using ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To pay attention to the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are grouped together in the menu creation, create conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the other conversion may be used by using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS-file and it can be viewed using Alt; 5 the PS-file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command, a viewer is usually invoked after compiling. if no inserted viewer should be used, each time it will open a new window.</seg>

<seg id="1859">The script function of & cile; allows the extension of ECMAScript -code. scripture scripts can be managed in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be seen in other versions of & kile; even more.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in & colile; a system-wide object (= kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions will be extended by a variety of additional packages. & cile; offers a lot of different help to support the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are delivered with many documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and another & latex; -reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">It is not only to describe a description of all programs (but a few key packages are described) but rather it is ideal for searching for a certain formatting. since it is a very large document, it is a very large document, it is divided into & colile; in three major bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; the finding of the correct document is not always easy. as you want help & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk provides a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and this for a graphic surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the desired advantage is the search for parcel names or whipped cream. by & colile, then only the results will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the options and borders will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it doesn't contain anything about itself.</seg>

<seg id="2027">The shortcut of this action. by clicking the user button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action, this text is inserted into the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are the quickstart dialog, or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified trails are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir / myScript.sh.In this way: global scripting folders: $KDEDIR / share / doca / scripts in their path: $PATH. there are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document's URL. in case of a local document file, file name: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods mentioned above, a script can input from & quantaplus; in the input field input may be determined, which is to send to the standard input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the printed application can be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal edition, printed on the default output; error messages should be specified on the default output. it can be specified as the default output is set to the default output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the Markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure promotions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and if the day attributes and you are planning to use" "" "edit" "" "dialog" "", "when available, enabling input to use the action possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignore! is it a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we & kiconedit; use of the & kmenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we don't need 22x22. to change this, select editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only helps you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view that the day starts, I have decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least release a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -Day in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be linked to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantilus; functions for tool bar, or it should set up this to better overview by some Trenner into several groups. open the tool bar and set out the tool bar. make sure that the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">"" "I want to choose the Trenner (left at the top) for my tool bar. after choosing the element, added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the tool bar." ""</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner does not support grouping. anyone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror could be the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after neweXML does not exist, it will be saved in the correct folder, but your toolbar should be saved in the correct folder, so that your toolbar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language. this is why this chapter will explain how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & monitors; -Repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. we need to let the first part to you, the second we deal here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path ad, relatively to this file, for documentation HTML files, e.g. php42 / # sections in Section 1 = Section 2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, day 1 = tag2.html-2 = tag2.html-3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the Documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation like something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 (PHP 4.2) = Table of Contents, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before getting started and Language Reference. it shows that it is about subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess setops (except by reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You can note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and in addition at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but look at & & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the area of docrc file that serves to display the context of context-sensitive aid. for example, if writing a & PHP; H for context-help the documentation should be displayed directly here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>

<seg id="2070">With & quantitative, you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places, there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others can be downloaded, and only available if our team needs them to be accurate and useful for publication, for what it needs to be a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case you have several keys (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the uploading will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can upload from the DTD DTD DTD (DTEP) menu, and upload tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantitative. in case of problems, and it can be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the name of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML language, which is currently not yet created by & quantitative. it can be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in everyday XML format. there is easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion may be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions row: the string, which in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning of the DTEP according to conversion: when activated, puts & quantile; after the conversion to the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative, there are some key concepts. to understand this and take full benefits from & quantitative. this chapter tries to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts, without whose understanding and quantitative. little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone who uses & quantilus, available. from toolbars about promotions, everything is selected as global, in the common order structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different materials, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will be available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personal.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns up to toolbars with special promotions. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the order tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The module Nautilus; -MDI; consists of some major areas: the editor window, the building views, the flashers with infos and the toolbars. please beat in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the box with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as close to the current, other or all cartridges, reload, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorarea to another context menu concerning the edited documentation, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), work under the mouse cursor or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor, the tool bars are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as a standard for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new features and therefore connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; if you want to insert the tag in your document, then you can insert the data for this just filled day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow you to navigate and navigate in the information, to navigate and pass through. in the presentation with card-riders are available for files, project, sample positions, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction intentions.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, uploading, or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantiate; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the information available to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit, or send email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an elementary proposition, the cursor is set to the position of the elementary proposition. by right-clicking a element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and evacuation of the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction intentions. with it, manquickly attributes and namespaces can change. the change of all available attributes with a few clicks may be made.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web-technology for your development. it can be downloaded and downloaded for documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be customized, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative easant; two cartridges at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information: the information window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about each in a quantum running script. for example, the current DTD uses the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, enter all error messages (so it is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitlus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate mill is the option to define own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar via email. & Quaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive to & Kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure them in & quantile.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of & quantaplus; for this, autoconf you can pass a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantum, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. you should also make sure that is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantilus; an independent, extendable Markup language editor would be? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now already far on the path to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. together, you can define it in & XML; then should & quantile; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantitative easing; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; Developer base is based. & quilt: it is not only possible to expand users, but it allows users and developers, & quantilus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative easants; allows WebDevelopers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). through self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation and toolbars can realize it. (more about this you can find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for rapid web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & qua; the original developers forsook the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of detail is to help with help: / qua (either enter this URL in & konqueror; enter or run as helpa help: / quantia).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list is changing every time, when you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. in the section above templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts during inserting from the clipboard, special characters contained in & HTML; file data, so that they are correct and cannot be understood by the browser as a formatment reference.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard in & URL, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to add & URL, s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a row number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not in. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Evaluation and switching of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main problem. the problem reporters is enabled when switching to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbols column from the main window. this column allows you to bookmark the bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries predicted or next, depending on the cursors's position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, according to the filenames of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantitative; -projects are stored with the extension of .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">A dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. this enables you to copy graphics files to your project folder or folder, and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Invites the files in your project to the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantitative; the project manages. in chapter & quantum, you can find the details here.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the tool bar type: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new tool bar. we just need to save the name. actions need to store actions with settings. toolbars are stored via toolbars or you will be asked when you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the view. that deletes it from your hard disk. if you don't have saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantitative; -Team, so the tool bar opens in the next release). the menu option opens a new email message using the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">The uploading of toolbars on the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own coating format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh of entities from the & DTD; it makes sense when the entities from the & DTEP; if this globally ist and write permission in the global KDE file is not available, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent paste of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion signifies that & quantile; using tool bar, if this day is refunded to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the listed menu points. click it. click on a activated plugin disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax indication for the current file. the list of available panels schemes depends on derate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate shutdown between different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries change sometimes time need or unnecessary graphics. recommended is the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for every open subwindow. with a selection of a paper, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Shuts down the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main windows.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog influences any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate there is details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars or which can add and follow the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the Mausoleum environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative information; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every Open Source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory, and should be completed by the top of the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be automatically set up with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">This is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webpra (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can use the server address of the machine where you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log will be used. depending on the remote computer, an adaptation might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and the default template. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change the static web content. for serverting scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">An employee if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be connected. if a project is reinstalled by reason, don't hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to credit.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks, by removing the bunny, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings, which can simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tab in the subwindow profiles or using the keyhole shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards possible), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option is listed above, including files that are listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded during the opening of the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be selected the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be adjusted to the options. in this case the debugging may be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles uploading profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, by hand an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as an mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, one can turn off event promotions and add these actions, change or delete actions. event transactions are executed when a previously defined event appears, such as the sighting of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens and quantile; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantitative, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave similarly, however, the entries are opened and open with... in the right-click popup menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in memory and forgot at the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog, if you change your opinion from the uploading process.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative information, many high load profiles can be generated and thus the project (or parts of the project) are uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your planing shaft, this is either a time saving function or a danger. if you have saved them after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu or project tool bar, accessible via the tool toolbar tool bar, open or erased.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own way of work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantile. best over the menu of toolbars. use and add to distinguish. adding tool bars will be covered down in the adding of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols on it can be set in either by context menu (right click on the tool bar), creating tool bar, tool bar, tool bar, which can be displayed in the dialog, where actions can be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries action will be removed and action edited that are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up set up in the menu with settings of toolbars... and set settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential document skeletons, code escalopes and files to link. you can copy, move, move or any existing system existing in the storage room. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you need for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantile; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are inserted into documents by shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the storage space under global templates. more information to the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. based on this templates, new documents can be created. normally you'll find a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises work in appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples may be found under global templates. see for more information to the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful, if not a new document, based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. some examples are found in the storage space under global templates. see for more information to the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for all sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure for you (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the storage room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn with pulling and shutdown on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a template folder. you can use all file administration functions to be used, such as pulling and inserting or inserting the file tree of Conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view onto a folder view and secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a highly targeted demonstration. you can set headlines and footer, or dynamic with & PHP; design, insert files or connected with them. additionally you can keep some things using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / templates / templates files. each of these folders equates to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text, or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as elterous attributes is vertipped.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all out of the ancestor in the system overview. if a regular folder would be set out in this path, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like Text-Baustein. if nothing appears, it is probably located in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for previous or introduced text for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines and footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip all templates for a specific project, and allows to equip all templates for a folder with special header lines / footer for a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have the context menu (indicate your right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative: offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which allows the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the Second divides the editor window in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor acts as follows: he recharges a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and edit the source code editor in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">In working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly using the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly using the VPL; it is necessary to edit this directly using the VPL; there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously runs, this mode is already active, the keystrosor is activated from a window to another, where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via adjustments (VPL;) you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set automatically after a click or automatically. basically, the recommendation can be set for quick calculator and a large pot for slow machines.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties, so as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. it serves as a new document with the VPL; this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons below or removed. one click into the list allows the amendment of the Inhaltes, for example keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing sites in the browser. you can add CSS rules using the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as with the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS classy setting by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as in a word processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. text can be used as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by typing or removed.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way via the toolbar, such as in the source text editor, which is inserted in the source text already existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, which is inserted with text, each other has to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the tables assistant or the lists-Assistent are disabled. later, they will be used later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists tool bars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and simultaneously changed the recirculation. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was showing me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no clues on the places where perhaps only the changes had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you wish to compare text quickly, copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way conjunctions will be fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently of each other on a piece of Kode and changes the original file. in this editor, you can edit the resolutions at the same time. in this editor, you can even edit the result at the same time. in this context, the display shows three source files at summarizing:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with the comparisons and merge folder. this screen saver shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and look similar to the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, this can be seen at a glance at a summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance when Nobody changes the return.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease your typing work by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse 3 folder 1 order folder kdiff3 Folder 2 folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 Folner1 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manually typing filenames, the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file for next time; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merge command will be selected, for B and C, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When interaction is crossed, the input field is active for the purpose and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file, but you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens up a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before you begin using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. in opening dialogue you will need to select the dialog simply by the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also pull pulling and pull off: pull a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file such as several similar functions. if you would like to find out how similar to these features, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to upload two relevant files, it in & kdiff3; download and compare them. now you can easily copy the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing out of & kdiff3; remove only the release of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drawing and put text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the Info line. the Info line contains the characters A, B, or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source codes are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color which distinguishes itself. if both files differ is the default color for this. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the gathering column. when differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful only to see relevant changes. (at C / C + +, B. are white signs only in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, separates files from the text, is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line will be displayed on the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparators) also has an Info line with the inscription edition:, the file name and [Gee] if you have processed the outcome, it usually contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, save is deactivated!!! (use the buttons jump to next dissolved / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, any difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlighted the current group. this group will appear with the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or manual editing does not leave any more line in the group; then it's only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; encoding process; appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the outcome window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you want to ignore the sources, ignore the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also covered as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the images and mouse, but you can also use the keys on the left, right, down, side down, side, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, siw like you can also use it from other programs. in addition to the vertical image line, you can also click navigating to Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the paste button, you can switch between plug-in and transverse mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the assembling columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as in the section summarizing and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-image Away / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up) or to the next / previous conflict as a conflict. therefore, soldering and unresolved conflicts has to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you will need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). however, this option will automatically copy and manually release the manual. be careful with this option but you could accidentally write the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in preference\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-line of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when the next startup. (menu Instellungen- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a lettering with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialogue also features variable width to choose which you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in recursive script. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be signalled. on these systems the button settings automatically creates an uneven colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, when pressing the tabulator button, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the one line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, every selection is automatically copied to clipboard. manually copy the clipboard manual.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">With the comparing of files & kdiff3; first, all identical lines can be ignored in the source file. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step, white notes will not be ignored. white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car-back string '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car backsliding mark, but then, files are treated with different sizes on the side-to-page comparison, but as a white character will be treated. during clasp, this option must be disabled. in default, this will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result the differences are still shown but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next unsolved conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Remove automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection). if you need this only from time to time, then use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in Chapter for scanning and execute a merge. check for details below documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already existing version exists, the original version is the suffix .original file. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and reboot, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is selected globally on the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if one activates this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice, which is the local encoding. (this can be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this is influenced as special characters treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file processed, you can define which encoding is to be used for storing files.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress emphasis added in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. according to selection from A & lt; gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed in addition to the normal information column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply blend the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to bring the files compressed into the merge menu, then, if you're using only two files. (if this function is used to start the merge file, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example to cut troubling parts or to correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command (see above), the output of the command is used only with the command processor. the output of the command is used only with the line of preprocessor. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable users to enable more flexibility when set the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases, or perl perfect.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this pre-processing command for line letters to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /\\\\\ 1 in the replacement string. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems apply some key words to automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $\ _ BAR _ _\\\ _ BAR _ _\\\ _ BAR _ _\\\ _ BAR _ _\\\ _ BAR _ _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _\ _\\\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _\ _\\\ _\ _\\\\\ _\ _\\\\\ _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. however, it's good as an example of a further preference command for line comparison. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Any indication between '[' and ']' is a hit, and every hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to carry out multiple settings at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate them from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of this, you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are given at perl some more details. where used\\ (and\\) requires Perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and guidance. the other operations only change the data that the line-off-algorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-pre-preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and compile complete folder with & kdiff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and simulate the simulated changes without having to perform them really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... runs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge single files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are combined, the folder 1 will be used as the basis. if no target file was specified, uses & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, do not select the merge, you must select the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about the actual progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder, it shows & diffuse 3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of all subdirectories. all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, this is visible in columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about any problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the colour is identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their total content is identical. then folders are the same color. with folders, the age is irrelevant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green then yellow and later, when it is old, red will.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types exist. as long as such flawed objects may exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types exist. as long as such flawed objects may exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders were specified. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: bring together and save the result in both folders. (the user watches as the visible filenames for the output file only B; right after the merger, and kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and select the newer file instead of merge, then examines & kdiff3; the date of files and if the files are different, but the date does not appear.. Solange such errors are not fixed, the merge folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During arranging, a file will be done after the others. the status column displays Fertig when the merger is successful, and according to other messages, when something unexpected is completed, you should make a final check and see whether the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in setup dialog, the file comparative analysis is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can compile either the selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfiles), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folders, then in the three-folder merges mode C, the target will be chosen as the target and when using synchronizing A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, check if all entries must be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through certain entries. check these options for avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all the entries together: select directory merge / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the keyhole): select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If any conflicting file types still exist, a message appears to indicate the faultless elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will lead to the Options, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you wish to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge one single file), then a merge window will open (see the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select a directory to run / continue, or press F7. if you don't have saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; you'll notice a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll find some error messages that help you to skip the cause of the problem, or solve the problematic entry. so you have the opportunity to solve a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually compiled, remembers & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and execute them all entries again. even if the meetings are skipped, these entries will be considered correctly. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern will appear in the original tree. you can enter the pattern with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the original tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the original tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files which also would be ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem, files have a disk attribute. in other file systems a previous score is selected as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links on files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to Folder: if the option is switched off, the links are compared as normal folders. if the option is switched on, the links to a folder will lead to itself. (note that this option would lead to a loop and dediff3; crashes.) This option is locked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Runs a full analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number solved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower than it does not contain text. (specify an appropriate Anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders via a slow network, it might be faster, only the change date and the file size. this speed advantage is a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this may be useful if copying the change date has been lost. please be careful with caution. this option is locked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, these proposals will be selected to merge that both folders are saved in both folders. this option is also checked in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, will be proposed to copying the newer file as an action. (this will be considered insecure because the other file doesn't change. you should check this in any case.) This option is default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version will be renamed. if an old backup file is already existing, this will also be deleted without further backup. this will also affect the complete assembly of individual files, not only the merge command. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folders-merge view remains visible to the merge of single files; you can turn off the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to share the main window in the window menu, turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file with double-click. however, in the directory menu, you can also select a single file directly, without having to execute the file, the status will be added to you and the file will not run again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders to open local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line uses a local file on a FTP server. the second command line uses a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively short or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, neutral &gt;% 20, etc.) for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23focal o% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link goal. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorizations or change date. therefore, the authorizations or change date from the original. (see this option only in local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reason for this purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDevc. KDevc first starts to launch the built-in differences. to use KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer, and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually required & diffuse 3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, & diffuse 3; the names of the original files from the patch file. if there is at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the patch patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if there is no original files. besides, the original files have changed since generation of the Patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparisons by folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Kompare) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I already use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by working in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone that way or let it go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are described first as the same; but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if IF, the next to each other, this entis cobra is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor appears for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. however, this key information is lost when the result is simply saved when the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can restore a certain version using a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lints; released and the text can't be extinguished. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight them. even more emphasis would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes you will find under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic subfolder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should not have any problems with compile. should, however, problems occur on the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-Remove) to clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position resp. replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program you need to relocate the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to exhibit the differences. this also causes that identical files do not contain these files in the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing following the merge. (the behaviour is probably shut down in a later program version.) This option is default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the outcome window (if the lines are already available), if the lines are already present, click on the button again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. Undershooting in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual space areas. it is quite practical to change the ongoing programmes on the workspaces, to stop them or move them. this works both in a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual space areas as well as the ongoing applications. applications can be selected and even on the desktop and to another.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both in a desktop and other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: when clicking on the empty backdrop of & kpager; click on the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. the commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only if clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is checked, window can be shifted inside the & shelf; s with middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager, the names of virtual space areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field can display the & kpager; display the numbers of virtual space areas. if it comes along with name, the names will be provided with ordinarily numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, running programs will be shown as small windows in & kpager; displayed. otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their choice.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol indicates a small viewpoint of the real program icon. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classic lets & kpager; like from pager applications in some other Windows banks; horizontally shows all virtual space surfaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with its content and move it out outside the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button inside & kpager; and you can set up a switch from the switch... letting the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. Falls, you must register as user root or address to your system administrator. in this file you must include the key windowTransparent mode and assign it to this one value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & kpager; part of the package, you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click at the same point. it is thought to help people who use the repetitive strains of Injury (RSI) syndrome and that every mouse click pains. furthermore, it can emulate the drag with the mouse. this also requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can cope with pain when using mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may find pain associated with the use of your computer so you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even though & kmousetool; pain helps in clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by using the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic agents, the result may be different for each.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & mousetool; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click away once you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift activated, makes & kmousetool; a break, after pressing the mouse button, wait until the end of the motion, before the release of the mouse button is done. this way, you can drag the bricks with the pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a bit of exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, this time must be silent before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the time turns is switched on (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the mouse button is waiting, before starting the mouse button, if there is no problem in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow move to the right and back brings a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but the first time has started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; to shorten the response time, go to Sound & Multimedia, select the Sound System and the tab General. there's a push-down sound buffer where you can adjust to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>

<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart shifting should be switched off first. if you have used to get used to the automatic mouse click later.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce antisks of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself conscious of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display undared reactions. therefore, you can park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is jerky, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse, but also the roles that get in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. however, it should be quick, if you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the side of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks down the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool does not allow the operation through the release of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this is reset by the status of & kmousetool; you can rework as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have him. but by pushing the mouse on a neutral field of desktop, if you have a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the tool bars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shift, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to run it into the clipboard, and to add it into any other action, but it will probably only cause problems again. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use intelligent shift, if you just start to use & kmousetool; lead to the end of the text area a mouse click, while keeping the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. by way, the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click is played. so you know exactly when smart shifts take the shifts. later you can use the intelligent shift without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you have to have the Xtest extension for & X windows; this should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers that are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; runs the mouse button once the mouse cursor briefly. this program has been developed for people working on RSI syndrome and where the people of the brightest pain is processed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button starts. in this way, drag and dropping can be performed using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The Edition of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will proceed to all other contracts. if the edition of the screen reader is read, the requested jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and ordinary text. these orders will be continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the messages. while you & cover; you can welcome someone who enters the room just. & kde; Notification is also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. any order, which you use from the map ticket orders, is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that have text applications. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders types are handled in queues, with the exception of the edition of Screen Readers. when a application reads the output of a screen reboot, while & ktts; just one such examples, this output will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text entries as well as on & kde; messages are applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and pass it on to the next filters. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future it can still be further types of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter fails to apply his rules, he continues the text unchanged at the next filters.</seg>

<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositivity filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, just remove anything from this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set of propositivity filters compare text with a regular expression of punctuation and adding a tabular signs (decimalcode 8) to the Sat.1 limits (tabulation Code) to the set of filters are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard set of marginal detergents may maintain the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied on & kde; messages (cold), warnings, news or the output of screen reproduction are applied.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & controlcentre, enabling the management of network interfaces, the route and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a set of system and desktop settings over a single, integrated surface. the & controlcentre; can be called by choosing K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network setting in the same way as other settings from & kcontrolcenter; create a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings at & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network setting (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting a controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & networkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical equipment and their drivers need to be operational and configured to be configured and configured to configure the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing and installed. network devices later added, the driver must be added later, corresponding to the following files, according to core version, are loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded when selecting network settings at & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network setting, this system is trying to detect the used platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release date. by marking the setting non-re-inquiries, this option can be set permanently. at the next startup of the network setting, the selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network setting is possible only in the system administration mode. in advance, all options are displayed, which means change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter the system administration mode at the right end of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode the complete functionality of the module is available. these are divided into three Reiter:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network appliances. all available network devices will be displayed. the following tasks are displayed on the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">"" "the settings displayed on network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button" "" "button" "" "button." ""</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button to view Advanced Options dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are brought from a DHCP server or BOOTP Server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings will be required for the system at the same time. the DHCP- or BOOTP Server will automatically send any additional settings. in the list box, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual can be made without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration must be specified. the input field IP address must specify the TCP / IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is checked, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values set in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in & console; you can determine if the required address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. switch on one-off network device is made by selecting from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub-network that mediates physical connection to remote networks and is used by default in the TCP / IP communication with computers in other backing.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS assistance will be replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses. if the computer uses http: / / www.ledomain.org, the DNS replaces this name into an IP address like about 123,45,678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator to naming the name's name resolution allows simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a application and execution or downgrading in the list with the buttons below or down under the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button to add... from the batch machine for naming resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button. the entry is inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the batch machine for naming resolution, select an entry and then click Edit button. it's going to edit the dialog pane.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known hosts describes machine name-to-IP address settings for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily with booting if no DNS servers will be available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of well-known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will support. this is still in the test version of IP to replace Version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">"" "enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click" "" "Add" "" "to add the dialog of the New alias." ""</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add. if the known host has multiple alias names, press the button Add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... Edit dialog box is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">One of the following tasks can be performed, then by clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, you have to be in a & console; the following command must be set off.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and to install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the install tool.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only recommend experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; you should compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; modified configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PCs into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 is expected to have no major distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the address to assign IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the network administrator to address a valid IP address or if available, the IP address can not be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts using the global (Internet) network. these addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its own use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard route, the second one is the loopback address (localhost = one's own machine). the default route is required for the IP transfer line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The netaddress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are being affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes change with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is any other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is completely sorted by scripts in SuSEconcage. another stand as expected can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trained the band and reads the pretension information of the tape. recognises & kdat; the previous credits are not, you'll be asked whether the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & kdat; the previous record, searches for the right index on your record. can't this be found, you will be asked if the tape index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes well, the icon is changing for the tape drive to indicate that the tape is bound. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to throwing the tape, the integration must initially be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by a change in the symbol for the band that the band has been resolved and displayed a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-cards must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not have to formatted with formatting up data. this process does not have to formatted before you formatted a band before using the tape. floppy disk drives are usually used to formatting the tape, DAT drives, however, does not use.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & kdat. all data on the tape are lost! upon completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the backup file, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a secure profile in the tree. only those files stored in the profile are stored.</seg>

<seg id="2922">This will create a secure profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder, where the backup is to be carried out. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected workfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For any folder that are listed under backup files, apply only the files stored on the same file system, such as folder. folders that are listed on other file systems. each entry is considered by tar irrespective of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The file name, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Release the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons & gt; gt; and lt; it was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-reformer version of the belt door.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & cdat before the tape is integrated, the command will be loaded to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary, before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option enabled, tried & kdat; the outlet to lock up the tape drive. probably this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched ON, the tape is cast off; automatically shut the tape. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tried & kdat; not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case, you need to communicate the blocksize for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The volume ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, the computer name of the full name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives created directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; features available, with their help the single protocol-lines of a protocol file can easily filter and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter on this manual.</seg>

<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a showless color as protocol-lines of the level note. the colour display of protocol rows can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command like for example to start the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>

<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage your subwindow. once you select a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a dedicated website to http: / / ksystem.forum-software.org. there you will find more recent information on the source of sources by & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; in addition, you will find it in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as & ksysv;) This section introduces a few concepts, and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init rapidly evolves to the standard for monitoring the system start in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (for example, because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is why anyone could try to put a machine on System V init, without a re-installation and reformat. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are in / etc. this folder called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local ought to be below / etc / rc.d when you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for this. you can also use rc.conf to / etc / rc.d when you want to run out something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different spots after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can throw a look into the second column, and probably determine that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can fix / etc / inittany of your hand. if you want to change it, then you will repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start the right scripts? if you enter it -l in rc3.d, then you'll see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no right files are located. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts it is written thus that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripting in the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd Server. init reads the name, and if the one comes, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way of creating machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-Runlevel, that lets you run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running out. additionally, I could also have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not to say: drag a record from the field of availability for one of the six runways to start at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runleveln or move the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this will not occur if they pull out an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you select them in a new area. to select them only on a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting boxes, before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries, which have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different operating areas (availability system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a choice of over- or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel (Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the tab button to switch between different fields. connect the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. default settings will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; restored to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runlevard, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in individual use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how system services are launched in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In case you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are provided by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end up if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send us more information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">In order to start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save them. either use the appropriate icon of toolbar or entry storing in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user trousers. to edit, select the desired users or the requested group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the user's dialog or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have enabled extended system settings for users. only if you have enabled space constraints (Quota) for users, a card card will appear on which you can view individual settings, if Shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password authority appears, if Shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD, are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least one embedded file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quotas group on the file system). here, each user may change parameters, whereby the limits are subject to KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the option of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map menu provides information on the user's assigned service. the default group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the prime group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the user or group menu or click on the matching add button of toolbar. to edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system, remove, remove, change systems, remove, change, change and more.</seg>
