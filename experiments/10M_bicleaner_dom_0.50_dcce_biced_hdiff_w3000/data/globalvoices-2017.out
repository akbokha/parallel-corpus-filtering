although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors picked up American authors and run its sports .
in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me , that I was a journalist , mostly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy by Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ student , which was the upper@@ most Federal Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming you can always be and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of same @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even wrote a very bad love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his tor@@ ch@@ iness .
he never holds behind the mountain just as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
yet people responded to his testimony and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the rep@@ ubli@@ can elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party of nomin@@ ating candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ots person ? I asked myself ?
I could not kill Tr@@ ump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alists , who took people from all over the world , a deep @-@ believing person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with the publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tr@@ ump Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who fights for their lives in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those by em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump hon@@ ed his way to the appointed rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a hold and the equivalent to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke .
maybe it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a race .
to order the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those who act and think of another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not considered in their con@@ greg@@ ations .
could it be that those voters think of which most of them have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country , which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ended the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ spre@@ e . : much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word play made of white in recording to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like sl@@ ing@@ ro@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones called exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what faith or background you always have , America is called everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise to and say : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rod , they say .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your United States ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; env@@ elop@@ ed the crowd .
&quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anybody who do not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ ump Country , said the news .
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
the music that is played in both places is not only changing the lives of children , but also a very tight connection ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds removed from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra which with their musical instruments have a possibility to overcome her surrounding poverty .
a school of 100 students has become a central interest for the parish of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth gave such a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the musical group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI believes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you will learn Day for day trumpet , trombone , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically located on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material :
music with prepared instruments , made of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycling line under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , C@@ elli , contr@@ abass , guitars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets and drums .
the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from the apost@@ asy .
today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from recovered material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste every year .
those who live with him and from him are the nu@@ cle@@ us - like people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work effectively fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the res@@ itu@@ ary occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this vessel had already been used to catch illeg@@ ally sea fishing , before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were so upset and slightly inc@@ lined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind of co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that were simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reveals Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crosses and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) was founded .
the members of this network are the six countries beside Somalia and Madagascar , which had then exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand each other in where it is illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to absorb it . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which particular habitats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem may harm a del@@ icacy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while actions against illegal fishing were hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and also by the Schne@@ ck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information in real time , the actions are happening in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange rates of existing licenses for example , breaking up @-@ breaking activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when moving on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in banned areas . even so suspic@@ ious road routes will discover that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such exam@@ inations can show whether the involved ships have a fish catch , where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can , based on this information , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours . and that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to figures from pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing will not be worth fin@@ anci@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales involving eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world . amongst these , even those illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishermen .
among these practices include actions , such as s@@ ails under false flag , counter@@ feit Lic@@ en@@ papers , specif@@ ying Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fish in reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and do not use the weak@@ nesses of a incomplete installation system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You should not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to conclude F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks which had counter@@ feit counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it wing@@ less ships and found .
based on its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing on large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to produce suspic@@ ious ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , also helps hide the illegal ships hiding them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO which deals with fisheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be used by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels . F@@ ISH will help you to find a criminal ship with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana . it offers a platform that can be satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to join the neighbors to get a better picture of what &apos;s doing - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to the study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on the global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system permit the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense crimin@@ als but they also put off .
ships which used to be used previously un@@ licensed , and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the participating countries involved in F@@ ISH , some 33 % increase in fisheries , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow networks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a student objective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined the West Africa Task Force so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , following the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia had its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used to tow the tow@@ ing nets , which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative work of the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the topic of the environment , engineering and nutrition .
her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , The New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in the centrally located north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute short@@ age of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the resign@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Contributors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and Ge@@ ot@@ tr@@ ate are considered to be the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine is considered to return the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture his institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators in the local cathedral pushed back to protect himself according to their own statement prior to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat state of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear sk@@ irts because you could see anything else , what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ograph@@ ics force the round , which forms the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

here is your ministry !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others utili@@ ze this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made a little bit against the devastating economic crisis and rather than to make critical voices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the fair@@ ers always take more incidence and intensity .
some vene@@ ers reported the media , they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or buying .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the big La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera proceedings in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined crimes committed during the Argentine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation then I thought that was ok .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ly , and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie official . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was born in 1976 to 1978 . he was a deputy commander of the intelligence unit 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the degree of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was friends who was fighting for combat .
all of them called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with an ERP .
pass only that they will not kid@@ nap you one day , and I will save you .

that is why he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be obe@@ dient .
I was 15 years old and I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers , who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university clas@@ ps , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda events , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ When the prisoners are over , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me in the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped p@@ ouch and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
and the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sne@@ aked in , and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on men .
she looked like a field of field and metal feathers .
later on , I found out that it was an end to a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just being folded there .
they seldom captiv@@ ate a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs at the bed , over@@ took it with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was sho@@ cking ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible to do a person with another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew that people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were hand@@ ch@@ ained and bound with wr@@ inkl@@ es .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilian which was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were facing down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and was killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms known as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed there a man and killed there .
( according to survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero who was also accused of death in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , whom the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was accused of death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this way and then have been tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the procedure .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; mar@@ spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all things stolen from home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that the yield of a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military characters , which you can attack an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could join with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal it all therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you looking for cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , beat me and cried :
when you go so far , then I &apos;ll find you and bring you home .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so was my father .
I have no one good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck pul@@ lover . both had my father out of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes at home .
back then , the defence accused me of being a prover@@ bi@@ al in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can load me to load what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos; .
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ent@@ ance .
I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you were ex@@ iled at people during dictatorship . but why should the bodies disappear ?
why do children kid@@ nap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families , to whom one could pass their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and anywhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but anything of course remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to put it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie even .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought , to show my father , was created during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience for him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was in@@ scri@@ bed and asked me why all the over@@ looked patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended was good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed awful crimes and you forced me to join them as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Now I told me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first display .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can imagine that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the Order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera proceedings ended between March 1975 and December 1978 and committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .

he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :

the court part is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations that have worked for many years of justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentin@@ ean organization , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial took more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial to be established there , which is now led by human rights organizations .

a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence in the last month witnesses of a particularly dis@@ mis@@ chie@@ fly translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on one shield the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( co@@ her@@ un@@ ten@@ sha ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps , perhaps also with the bad back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was published on electronic displays from 1 to 20 September in the lobby and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely divided in social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a member of Ky@@ oto , who was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ fecture Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had been reviewed by trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told us as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people were off@@ ended by in@@ sufficient correc@@ ting ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but certainly cause concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this means that her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fall in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors induced accidents in the same period .
the name was not named reporter in the article published in Yahoo ! article comments on light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors was given by the following comments :
- Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) does not mean the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So wrong the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not quite such comments .
why is the &apos; En@@ gr@@ ish &apos; spread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
to transfer you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in mother@@ ly language . in general , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the output language - mother@@ language should be .
thus , French native speakers must translate the French into English - not from the French into English .
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not deal with English as a native language , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost , or the relatively low number of English native languages that are Japanese to learn .
some companies who do not have foreign employees even support companies in the company . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge become the best , are made to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ rying and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through machine translations , show that this technique can still not replace a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the most strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used t @-@ shirts or pockets , are used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , from big companies or by the government which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in future the city of Kyoto uses a serial source of its translations .
Venezuela : take protests and z@@ ain@@ ties on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users used no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay .
other users wrote later that the internet performances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will not be accessible as well .
other online channels also covered protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positions groups that oppos@@ es the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court cleared the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s duties was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is connected and recommended the U@@ ber , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : enable your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ elan providers are again closed .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly at the reporting of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened with money and closure if they continued to report on the demonstrations , the Commission would continue to call this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is astonishing that it &apos;s still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IN fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay was accessible by a lock of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two further online channels . this also concerns the website , which transfers their meetings to the National Assembly .
earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local internet service can sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server en@@ quiries certain domains .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ding or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was hired on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ amer@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was arrested in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported to regul@@ ate the government &apos;s Internet connections : this means that the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage is always more difficult in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are becoming a slave to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collecting some other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of cour@@ ageous .
the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ eil que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lowing cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household in which she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from university , she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house filled with pride over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one calls in Paraguay the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her min@@ der@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , training and roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , however , is that the children need to work countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that may not lift up in the context of a contract that is not able to pick up .
this practice , referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations widely .
after completion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is generally still silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family , who have their daughter in the belief that they will complete their training , improve their position in society and can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do something out of yourself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who accepts the girl with itself , and justify their exploitation with the belief that it would give someone a chance that would not have any training , and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the so far relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the confin@@ ed in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of severe blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military camp Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the local community .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck down with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the young girl &apos;s life .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
she empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , the deeply rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go was responsible for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions live boys and girls .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil @-@ social organizations demanded a generous examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be a landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exploited not only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when her father worked , while her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work out to work on the street or on the market , sell money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that her time for learning was still alive .
she was at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she had finished with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the landlord &apos;s library as food out of the fridge . &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympathy of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a gathered in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
thereby , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although he did not keep she intelligent , but she did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke while he talked about politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were of the opinion that I would see there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ to home their mother tongue .
their Lord feared that they had the formation which they had made to lose , explains them .
she was , however , completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid for her hard work .
in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken is Mob@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ anas , to whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that anyone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , during the period where friend@@ ships develop , I felt very clear that I was not part of the group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and child care in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who play in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary members recently agreed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign regul@@ ators to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulation of use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is adopted by Parliament , user accounts and users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to be able to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is assigned to citizens to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users had to register on the website of the site with their correct name and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it failed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , who consists of six paragraph and is independent in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ ophone and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , as the draft law is to impos@@ e the regi@@ stry . un@@ clear is also how they are supposed to be able to register the user , who is not able to sign up for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ler , par@@ liament@@ arian and sponsors of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and a password from the telec@@ ommun@@ ications department , and a password , &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , blocked the Facebook . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall around the national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians , to access the network , to access the network .
but it is not known so far , that such plans exist .
experts and experts are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ olog@@ ous ( in German &quot; senior research schol@@ ar &quot; ) the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they control non@@ violent public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will be able to filter out a strong surveillance system to initi@@ ate citizens , which means an author@@ ization or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and to bring them to a law@@ suit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitu@@ tional Committee before the plenary deb@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement has been successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament in whose minds should be maxim@@ ized and ensured that there is no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ Hawai@@ y proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crimin@@ als in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those intended to be found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural minister protects the Persian Leop@@ ards from the war in Iraq

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq , the animal minister H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation of Nature Iraq have decided to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly chess le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that mat@@ ures through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and because they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards important ?
as Raz@@ a shows up in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild way is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera team , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as educated Bi@@ olog@@ in , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of their country , which exists not only from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is setting up that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region will be set up .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , responsible for the North American Japanese , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , established the progress being affected by the &quot; three @-@ way disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ologically pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , both of which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ hoods of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , as the tsun@@ ami had all the coastal cities of the map .
even though the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , but that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress of six years later , in order to re@@ build the local life of local societies .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building and survey results of the concerned itself .
the residential construction work in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ in@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings ( in charge of charge , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
with the biggest success amongst the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was experienced , 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima made its final light with 70 percent .
even six years after the catastrophe , they still ende@@ avor to be evacu@@ ated by recept@@ acle , evacu@@ ated by recept@@ acle . ( local charge , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the Thir@@ st catastrophe , almost 80 &quot; 000 people were forced to live in shelter workers .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such sho@@ re@@ ments .
nearly 40 per cent of the Hung@@ arians living in Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ if@@ ications , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ates had been evacu@@ ated after the disaster in shelter , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ oc@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , re@@ opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the airports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , only 30 percent of the fisheries in Fu@@ kus@@ hima have resumed its operation .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident resulted in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land @-@ wide .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 acres of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened well again .
tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can have only 75 per cent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native population prepared to the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper led many surveys under the native population and below the evacu@@ ation . she question@@ ed them concerning the status of reconstruction and as well as you have changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more information about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population who took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in cases of disaster prevention was done .
as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung increased its attention also to the situation of the evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was a witness of the worst , dis@@ asters caused by atomic dis@@ if ever experienced in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated buildings from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , which had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement homes .
after 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the evacu@@ ated cities are getting older than 50 years old . they are known to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is the project &apos;s project projects that will be part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our Podcast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , however , one often recogni@@ zes that a more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention when they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to anyone on language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Crime is talking about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ ar@@ asa gets aware of how the love of music has been found in rural China ; Adriana Mac@@ ia says about the time she has worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b is looking back to his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations by the police
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer fought against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest march .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a brain trau@@ ma and suffered several frac@@ tures .
doctors accredited him on this Saturday and then put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly throughout Brazil within a few days .
there is also the face of the police officers to recognize , who attack with a barrier . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of an investigation by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he beats in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten up by a protest@@ ers and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the whole oppression would justify it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video from Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and to divide several par@@ ame@@ works shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus over the 50th second .
now , for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to un@@ cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police forces . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was accused of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira there , after being attacked by a police officer , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , who struck him on his face .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday came to brutal police approaches to protest@@ ers .
polic@@ emen were sitting in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker announ@@ cements on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian Media logs have sli@@ pped the focus by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted glass windows specifically to create their cover pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window , than the protests of exchange people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this is necessary to recognize , if you are stri@@ cted against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are sli@@ pping from head@@ lines using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the lost villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba included the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - unknown , regardless of that there are no notable sugar@@ cane on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar cane factories .
after excav@@ ation , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually remained in steel and concrete .
about 272 workers had to invent themselves ane@@ w .
some changed the work .
other re@@ signed and com@@ mute daily to factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a solo @-@ ste@@ amer , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ bs his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane plants in the east of the region , after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remember that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stands the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , lack of administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest@@ ing has been no more curiosity .
why was the Cuban sugar cane turned off ?
the old railway st@@ iff of the church looked at even better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
initial idea was to focus on production on most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motives which lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the sugar prices rose from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and agricultural organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come down with certainty in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as a soldier is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory is the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion , not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus , they formed a full time - working group .
prior to the first year of success , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents which were removed only regarding the parts which would be removed , the address sat and the date .
they were all signed by Ul@@ an del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the tac@@ kled factory for two years and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operating sugar cane . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the feeding of the factory , whose construction he helped , involved .
each part he dismant@@ led , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut talk of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has only extracted heavily by grinding .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the People &apos;s community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane was closed , or better said than they began to remove them , they also listened to the asphalt road , this also dis@@ advantage other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production doesn &apos;t even serve for the supply of the commune .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , yet he gives the lies which one told him not .
they have been tor@@ ment@@ ing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is working in pension with 65 years , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations @-@ you@@ ths use hip @-@ hop to express itself and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young@@ sters of First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of travelling workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour since 2014 , workshop manager mobile Ton@@ gy@@ ms bring directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in discussions like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ Cal@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street stage in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared , or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to conv@@ ey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of glob@@ alization is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters have not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young@@ sters involved here were helped by Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop group who gave them a rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be displayed close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( public , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers see this plastic dishes , and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo District of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce the plastic dishes which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually so usual that they do not even notice them . a new trend , however , trans@@ forms its current cell phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin @-@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic coating , decorative cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , cooling disease mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ wering cool@@ ers for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food items is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile @-@ cell support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
this part is also made for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple who holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there somebody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic coating can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile support has the form of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ ards from dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which will focus on the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the ver@@ mi@@ sts and rum@@ ours regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect at all not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looking at the people or for the churches who have learned to live with pain .
here are behind each corp@@ se , behind every bone report in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico wrote the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to live with drug trade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which told these victims and told stories of people who were moving in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when doing business , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ickers , and whole communities have to travel many kilometers to buy something like milk .
pain of the victim
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks out secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which was lost only one day to her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have tried to go and go to graves , according to men who loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electro@@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship .
there is also my mother , who is with me too .
at the moment she has no revenue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they demand a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I now know disease and sensation of journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass through newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology , or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is attached or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he will become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the off@@ ences , when they go through the streets .
for me , it is as if they mo@@ urn for those who have lost someone and those who have fear them so much .
I see our weakness when stories to be bare numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of man is incredible for me when death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upright &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main urban district : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a family with threats , she describes money from her business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their family had torn apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
pain is not running away , trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
it included her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to dec@@ eive or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these terrible days , if I would dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Bryan is an orph@@ an and he tells us to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes s@@ own , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood was ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who had been shot dead bodies of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and entering into the soul of the country .
only few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; founded the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr user Nikl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages he linked are linked to which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about raising a rum@@ or or un@@ mask a fake .
but what is the years after the first time emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pers@@ ist on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his first publication it was used to have mis@@ guided trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker wag@@ ons the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war Africa had been neglected the second largest country for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of blo@@ ws that were difficult to drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to victims .
administration officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of homes , including a movie nearby , which was full of people , that watch the World Cup .
houses burned down and burnt corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident are the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of hollow body , rising on the ground during persons , watch them .
but the story doesn &apos;t end here .
for the years the same photo was exp@@ elled several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , and in fact , real @-@ time not related to the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what was happening in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the isolated Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
witnesses reported dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bus@@ hes .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count the corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were torn , shot or burned .
only from satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army gun in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military in Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am military ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this dis@@ mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image has been presented as a proof of measures .
one step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange came also in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were killed , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi @-@ Arabic news page that in 2012 was said to have participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to His testimony , but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide operating range of false data
traces of these false cre@@ ws go back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information limits can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the Tin@@ Eye search engine has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images that are very similar to the picture taken from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private site , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded wrong reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have bor@@ dered examples of the abu@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they had been published , so we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
many of the countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other ) can have several examples of abu@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now become fully ins@@ ulated ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country samples of false cop@@ ulation of the picture from DR Congo to Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries indicate pages or servers which are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in Grey are examples , which are available through the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably counter@@ feit banknotes .
as a memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

one page , which leaves rum@@ ours to appear in question , shows that the said photo Christians were killed , that were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only ren@@ ame the mis@@ carriage , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as related questions about the int@@ enti@@ ons of persons in the DR Congo ( DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in north @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica newspaper , is identified as the Christian part of the village .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , used to illustr@@ ate the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genocide against Muslims continues to be silent in Myanmar , peace of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article does attention to the continuing hard@@ ship of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but cited the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express did not contain this image .
Greece , 2012 . &quot;
there was a public offering , wei@@ rs , the local community of Bosnia Herzegovina . &quot; warning ! &quot; ( warning !
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the image as a proof that Muslims sl@@ ay Muslims .
this asser@@ tion was ref@@ uted by a Greek Fak@@ ten@@ check @-@ page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency of N@@ asi@@ m and illustr@@ ative the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the Old Town Hall Pie@@ dic@@ ast@@ ello dis@@ sent this message to his page to express his solidarity with the massacre of Nigeria in Nigeria .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo of the DR Congo was a proof of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public debate .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an abu@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , and on the other hand a blo@@ gger , who are pursu@@ ing sympathy across the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand the attempt to talk to Roh@@ ing@@ ya , as the photos of these were abu@@ sive .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar published an amend@@ ment to what it referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate news and photos , the international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision , published exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ feit pictures of rum@@ ors that operate H@@ ate Speech and spread by extrem@@ ist groups , that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , states that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page , however , claimed that the President of Myanmar Trust had agreed to be in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release , the image will continue to include .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students , who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catho@@ lic@@ at news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture was not from the k@@ illings , but it claims that it is a similar d@@ Shi@@ a Shi@@ a attack .
when the picture was later moved in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , signed with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , who were suspected in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was am@@ used as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were connected with that were not addressed in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to set attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos - on the Nig@@ erian massacre had been put in circulation , we translated discussions like this one here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the Embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Martos was born .
there are further examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date est@@ amps exist on the web cra@@ wler and collec@@ ts them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which had only been published clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture probably carries a proper description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( blocks ) that pass through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to larger discussions about the silence associated with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued by a European or French life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth discussing how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer offer these images longer .
with social media , there are millions of people who are un@@ intended to have the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ - and Fal@@ sch@@ y , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and for@@ ts the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that it is with@@ drawn from images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images of readers and viewers dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate and take the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which sought to help others to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss non@@ violent depic@@ tions in the news media , fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologi@@ ans are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will have to re@@ think about situation , in which a picture is something suggests , but it can also be replaced by the context or in a fully ab@@ rupt manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any examination of false grants should , however , consider how internationally it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ transc@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transc@@ lat@@ able ( for example ) tries to offer lingu@@ ists a selection of words from the whole world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inde@@ cent words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to an easy translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to precisely understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transc@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - En@@ joy your parents in recognition of how to make you ende@@ avor to your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ v@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , you feel after you w@@ ander in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they de@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thought and ar@@ ous@@ y our curiosity .
sometimes you know how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page you want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaker of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Jazz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment of the worst flood and land@@ fall disaster in this decade opposite .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually in late May , rivers include rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country over the shore .
according to an opinion of the disaster centres of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely missed hundreds of people because of the floods and slaughter lights .
more than 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 secure residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the rivers in some areas went slowly .
health and hygienic conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas in the affected areas .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the scale of the flood catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ arius crisis , save the Children , after further rain falls on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the floo@@ ding , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was flooded during the yesterday super@@ imposed water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Luftwaffe made five air@@ planes available for rescue actions , and another five are made to transport emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and food necessary for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; High Water Aid &quot; button which allows users to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they introduced an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key which included more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat activities for flood and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka can be fully exploited for several social media platforms , residents in need in need of safety and help help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka &apos;s long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

use authorized t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour in love and loving girlfriend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute , we call for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next step , we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of um@@ bre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others , slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things are not affecting you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already done this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people of whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that has built up in their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look alike .
we practice different religions .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , in different kind of art . but somehow we will all be put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is designed well in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , could be mus@@ li@@ gently .
to be con@@ stru@@ ed
I do not stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western show , the Rum@@ is religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , which had colon@@ ised Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman who should be saved .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was the story behind these pictures .
but these images carry out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rati@@ ves domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows the reality that have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women must be prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women forced by their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ass@@ umes his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is also clear that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought to slave vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has deeply occupied our collective imagination and faul@@ ts that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become anti @-@ milit@@ ant attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or using alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to gras@@ p the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation that came from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents lived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian in Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan was thinking the Sky@@ lines of the World , my parents were un@@ touched Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ touch@@ ingly Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I do not eat pork , I say - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or to put my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims are dealing with - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all the hand@@ bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight far widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ decorated Islamic fin@@ alist machinery , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ y , who is already a defective picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who breaks the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as an Muslims , but was born in a Muslim force when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious lives , they rely on the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbors , my rock in the surf that I could see Muslims , when they could look through the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the omni@@ pot@@ able ritual with my daughter when I held them in my arms and her Arabic verses to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ts are called .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , evil that can be seen and evil that is not able to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grandmother is the image of my mother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters ; as she will win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi over decades ago .
it &apos;s the picture of you that I see my eyes closed : nano , surrounded by their perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a hall@@ mark with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that it can be complex .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers , which she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be to be Muslims , as she taught me to relate to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people , which - over centuries - was founded - through an &quot; Empire &quot; colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; by the name of Ehr@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my dear grandfather is weeping .
meanwhile , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ touched about his family in the India of India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , whose families , as in my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as the game &apos;s risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to know that in the past two centuries , Europeans have had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped out of a century above a Muslim country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ ful sub @-@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since he was the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it means that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over every continent , except Antarc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie among the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be aware of an American Muslim means that the suicide rate has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy goes through the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story is reported for four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means that four@@ teen years ago , the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel as people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black lives .
an American to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multiple hy@@ phen , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the scar of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is shown in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are er@@ ect on this pair of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is established in the Muslim regi@@ stra@@ ins , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .

it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the visor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars which we lead and the bombs we shed in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from the North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in the evolution of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep into being a Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we come back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ t@@ less and dangerous times that we cat@@ walk in our news editorial offices .

there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years before it had not yet given them ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am worried about the real@@ ities and history that I was not aware of , as I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but I have made me a dis@@ astro@@ us Muslim today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things I have left behind here like a cr@@ isp@@ y lane in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ts that makes our humanity , a story may listen to someone else &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find conven@@ tions under the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves of un@@ comfortable questions according to its role , deliber@@ ately and un@@ consci@@ ously put the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the employment is to have a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , as he already capit@@ ulated countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among others made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban diversity
telling stories , by Flickr user Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with somebody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , the founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to receive and dig@@ ni@@ fy the language variety of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin , in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be passed to the born children there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we have to create towns , the diversity - secure rooms , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often is linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to make , build . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers do their story first in their own language , or translate them in English .
although the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their presentation make sure that the audi@@ ences are inter@@ cep@@ ted .
they call laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of tales for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Be@@ ak of the Rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after expl@@ aining the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it speaking to a public that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of inclusion &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . everyone who insp@@ ires by the project can engage with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA Neu@@ sti@@ pul@@ sion of the State Schools

she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( mayor for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the State Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ate of new debt of debt also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives arrested the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he did for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference of the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of Books from the Book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ situ@@ te ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year , was released and licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it is called :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would educ@@ ate how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected to which this is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on site to see through the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acc@@ laimed Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted in the A@@ dra @-@ Pr@@ ison directory , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives a voice to his friends and his family , who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was taken out of the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bas@@ sel referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by people on 12 November 2015 , who used himself as an in@@ si@@ ders of the Assad administration and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in spreading access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently trans@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of bas@@ ing cultural prototypes were more pre@@ dominant than the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this tri@@ pping into digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel was not able to close this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with him , to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually stopped in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a trial , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together for the book a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .
cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sank in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the spi@@ der in the moment we embrace us ,
that each of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I cut into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion ,
when your eyes say farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to recover all of the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I &apos;m talking about myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
during the course
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
bas@@ ing story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( the Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ .000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer had died in prison according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption , Principal Con@@ duc@@ ed following provisional release once again
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique was re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , with which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , which was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants , sentenced to 22 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds of Mos@@ ambique from Mos@@ ambique before the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good leadership and demanded immediately his re @-@ setting in the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with an opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which took the request , there would be no obstacle due to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to acquire its old post , since the company had no discipl@@ ines after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not give the action good .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we notice is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ isation process against the listen@@ ers .
however , the firm seems to have an adequate legal step for the application of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well and considered the case as &quot; contra@@ dic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had eaten .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could consult and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company which he helped to inf@@ lic@@ t damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ tory !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science says in Brazil , the director had no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ulted him , I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already been so massive to the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks the mor@@ ale and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served himself to the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand it turned around an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself , this man is we@@ ary , charged and ultimately condemned to a long sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , l@@ apping and - inci@@ dentally , Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions when he confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of all , also the f@@ ather@@ land for its amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from its amb@@ itions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a more ambitious human is criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he was 10 years off and escaped .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or age @-@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the grid because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook addresses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ Ã© in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely decre@@ asing con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alist as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat H@@ ass@@ al in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on his platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself calls not automatically calls out H@@ ass@@ al .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have been discussing the use of the Word or have doubts over the use of his usage as an expression .
beyond that there are several bur@@ ial words with different mean@@ ings which have the same book sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ ese , also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ages ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on spiritu@@ ous way , if they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by playing a p@@ un .
the proposition ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles a rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ alls is the opinion that they decrease H@@ ass@@ al radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it del@@ eting all posts , which could spread across the suspicion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook cle@@ ars the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automation will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ ility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should happen instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( age ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these tri@@ angular nation@@ alists , spreading the H@@ ass@@ language , get a pretty good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the promotion is able to send a strong signal to all the h@@ ass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of cat@@ alogues often becomes a cat@@ fish and mouse game , with the users to use social networks simply to use a new word or alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung &apos;s My@@ at described as Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new guidel@@ ine from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not slip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or just try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ ays radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asked for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words are to be called only more hatred within the different communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without any local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even as they found out , they did not have mistakes , they did not try to rec@@ ti@@ fy the fake posts .
if they were just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would make them big sales , it would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has ensured for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among the users .
instead of taking it serious , users now make fun of Facebook and consci@@ ously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of h@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook po@@ sts , which won &apos;t contain any h@@ ass@@ als , but they have been removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
post : when you &apos;re a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ideology and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence increased .
among other things , H@@ ass@@ al should also heat the violence in the mun@@ icipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his failure to bring out H@@ ass@@ ling har@@ ass@@ esses to his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply getting the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have worked better , rather in context than on code concentrated and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s care
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s work is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament approved unanim@@ ously a law which aims to forbi@@ d that practice , so that the age of marriage is now at 18 .
there were some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered together , that the state would not inter@@ fere in the state that the state was not best@@ owed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has a contrac@@ tual partner to UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined by min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 were already married to Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the official central office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media moves that ende@@ av@@ ours were to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s before , followed on the base and were rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition was in fact un@@ complicated to tension , and sometime , in some point , doubt , whether the opposition would agree at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained him in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , so that he would have a simple majority to make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ located Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against Child &apos;s before was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 voices and none to them .
after previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws had been modified for children &apos;s care before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who lined up a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk needed , but you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was so happy that the day had finally arrived :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 against it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who li@@ stens to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society , which openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law said :
the Holy Spirit of Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change to commit adul@@ thood was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all members , who were opposed , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ sag@@ a .
many thanks to all the activists who have taken him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our ME@@ Ps .
but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj promised his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said that Mahar@@ aj was contrary to the law , the most social media users would wish to change the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposes :
dear Sat , if we are instead of talking about the discussion so generally , in a way that we could talk about the state in our bedroom , simply specifically to talk about it , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ sigh@@ ted men who are against them in the benefit , &quot; would you be willing to carry on the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not about a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial process against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations is legal or the norm , although there are laws , which they say .

screen@@ print of the message posted on Sunday early on the website of the state roll@@ er@@ roll by the district Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that fall together with the day of Russia - the Russian national day , the site of the state roll@@ ers of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was chopped down . h@@ ack@@ ers left behind a wit@@ ty message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned mot@@ if@@ s and balanced colors .
the motivated person even motivated him to wear and try to damage the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als , ende@@ av@@ oured to bring the international stage to the international stage .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that di@@ vert attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class position in his work helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I started to tri@@ ck@@ le pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look .
and he should know , because he had already stood at face to face :
a tiger cannot be b@@ other@@ ed by the opinion of sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately follows us and he star@@ es me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make in Bar@@ dia National Park Pictures from Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as a part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care to express the name of their husbands , or even of older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns , saying &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give women to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should be ab@@ used for the norm to maintain this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ U@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and exp@@ elled from their family and village community after having responded to a married family .
the tradition of wives also do not name their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to fear , if any , they shouldn &apos;t come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff , and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly to the main inter@@ viewing theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the fin@@ es of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is involved in the removal of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ amera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s homes up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS in@@ fest@@ ed , and heads this club .
it tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and they simultaneously have made amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in its discussion group was women who do not call their husbands by name .
it has decided on this issue because they wanted to open the interview about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem where women can easily identify with themselves .
the name of their husbands don &apos;t say al@@ oud , is a custom that they all have fully invo@@ ke and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition relates that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t holding this will be regarded as a mist@@ y , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought of this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , had never called upon the name at home , as it runs at home .
she showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected mainly girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they want , that they may not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries old tradition , in which married women never allowed to speak out of their husbands &quot; names .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy , that she was just before the whole exercise ; a different one decided to leave the whole early fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in adren@@ aline pump@@ ing over , with an ancient brilli@@ ance , the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home .
and they held their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when her mother in law she was star@@ ed , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participants was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , indic@@ ating the status as :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the cin@@ o@@ ber@@ red point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laughed only and I heard him to carry him .
the other women have not stopped complete with it , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose him in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip on every discussion club .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not want the women to make up those who hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and spoke about things which they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have been linked to some things , for example like our ident@@ ities on our husbands , never said to be honest .
it feels great to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have carried only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is that okay , but some wanted to carry a sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dreamed .
after a lot of conflict and discussion about the advantages of his own coat @-@ choice , the mor@@ ale connected to the sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a while they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they are going to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the rolls :
so far , we have made small steps so far .
some women tested it a couple of times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women are now carrying Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in a discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the rush order to reach more freedom of movement or his own coat @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realize they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives everyone of us confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks in the club and other people about it what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to leave the Japanese .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here is quite fast that they didn &apos;t have any other choice when the Beatles was receiving with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a new system of ab@@ duction of gl@@ and@@ able persons for the Organ@@ iz@@ ers , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has called for a number of operations in life to stop the pract@@ ition@@ ers .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and taken in a row that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been exploited .
there is a local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a man @-@ headed man &apos;s gold may bring ancient or wealth , the police leader of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia is the BBC .
it is the first time that the following attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
another group , the purpose of murder , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission that the UN launched a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have prepared to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are traveling by Mos@@ ambique men in Mozambique are the aim of ritual attacks , the Muslim police war@@ med up the latest murder of three gl@@ atz@@ ins of men because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the murdered victims were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Ad@@ amo , a student and resident of the city of In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane located in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police came in the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of the hypo@@ critical men .
the prosecution and assassination of gl@@ ac@@ eous individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ ov@@ bal@@ a district , has been commissioned by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans , which also claims that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power , the riches of riches .
in the last few days three men were murdered with hair loss in this part of the country .
as Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which indicates that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique to go out to take sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation in which people would not vulnerable to pursue their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os could be ch@@ ased or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that aim to reach fast riches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the serious correc@@ t@@ ness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor had not missed .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under the Global Vo@@ ices partner agreement .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o did attention to the international community after his lawyer was announced in late June that he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver canc@@ ers in the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( citizen of state ) after he participated in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to aband@@ on the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , po@@ et@@ ess of Liu X@@ ia , to release or allow him to permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , other countries are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should have pressure to permit Liu in foreign countries .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government felt that this ultimately won &apos;t do anything with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year , Norway . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to go back to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope for a conditional release to the expression and invited Liu a to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to receive his prize .
during the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us to the release of Li@@ us as they announced in a statement on June 30 :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are at the same time that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits , which they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that Americans would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar it is with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman by the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message to release the Chinese authorities , not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia freed from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ integ@@ rating of the U.S. Embassy with@@ drew a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ing of the State Department , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to settle down and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to medical supplies of his choice , based on them according to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to impos@@ e Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o without un@@ condition@@ ally release in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German actors of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin hoping that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency Reuters that China had great concerns , if the vort@@ ex had been over@@ l@@ ayed by Liu the visit in Hamburg .
Canada : Canada
on June 28 , Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for a reasonable medical care for China to provide the opportunity to provide him with his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P that Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to preserve the rights of these rights .
France , France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info told that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information that France would eventually take him up .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release Liu &apos;s release and demand a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful funding to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us being well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took and had been punished for it to a more harmonious , more stable , more prosp@@ erous and prosp@@ erous society led to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and concerned citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city .
this remark in the blo@@ g@@ osphere has triggered a debate .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting in the international branch of the State Association of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised Domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he support Singapore to be considered as a city .
... No one asked if New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people commit a mistake .
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian propor@@ tions of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ ed to create this valuable country , we hear that we are not able to be a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a must @-@ bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; because of what he inev@@ it@@ ably appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York alike , equal cities that are permanent from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the Th@@ ames , the good old ly@@ re appears of the author@@ itarian rulers , who pret@@ end democr@@ ats , the dist@@ orted logic , as it fits better to her power .
in the end , the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
for appropriate questions , he clo@@ ak with non @-@ responses of r@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country our city belongs ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take up the effort to stop this point where he was paid highly to be part of the city of Singapore .
by rele@@ asing his comment on the blog , he tells of the reviews that you should begin to read the full address of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the testim@@ oni@@ als of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to Singapore is a city and no country .
read the inscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ even important , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these towns looked for decades a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice said to Singapore very much ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which is expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and consci@@ ously is what he is defending .
the TE@@ MAS@@ EK Review de@@ compos@@ es the vulner@@ ability of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; ben@@ evol@@ ve an error &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der spokesperson ?
when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabin , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of major importance .
why do the Singap@@ ure@@ ans pay their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister In@@ voice ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in addition , the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade ten@@ ds to the affir@@ mation of Singapore , and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence appears to have anno@@ yed a lot of Singap@@ ure@@ ments ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hear the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute can@@ adian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked for recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuing line , with the rum@@ ors to be revealed through certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thompson , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication then the default answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadian cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly in rage when they are held for Americans , but me does not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their ruck@@ sack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American , however ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian have always worn small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gay donkeys are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we clearly say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t make me sense if you would exchange me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; means to be sk@@ e@@ zed in essence - such as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , soft , but trag@@ ically significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double devils ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
being harmless , is in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things going around a around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major issue of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ si@@ ders are as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just a bold courtesy .
Canadian do not often talk about the fence .
us l@@ acks a warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I meanwhile connect to my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are . our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
musical video of a Pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video showing the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and re@@ plen@@ ish the civil government despite their promises , the country will continue to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules make him his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the uploaded Video 1,@@ 254 times was shared on Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; has been blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists enter@@ tained the public to watch this video .
the video you can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it is with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that have continued to pursue Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision making important national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amend@@ ment of journalists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people , viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image above reflects the adoption of the law on computer criminal , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules often are used by the authorities to unite activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was created , who supervised the online content and to people who have accused of sl@@ ander@@ ed the monarchy .
Thailand puts a strict conflict against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that continue to pursue the Jun@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts war@@ med it , that the purchase is unnecessary and waste of control .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before entering into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison because they are supposed to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and use Internet users to anger the monarchy for long time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; the Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who already had been using by Put@@ sch &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests .

post@@ war society re@@ covers only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , mainly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic War was officially ended , but his scars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the basin of wast@@ es .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , am@@ ort@@ es , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called violin @-@ capit@@ als in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these populations .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the area was 16@@ ,000 people , after having hardly risen above a decade .
about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ floor living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ka , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ atri@@ ated and very seldom they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to end him .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why speak ?
nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with all @-@ sized spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived in this place and have contributed their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , meanwhile have left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mara , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v kas that can accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes at the balconies , where it is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover myself with the camera in hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the District Administration is free of charge and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cchini &quot;
some ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mara to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in South Asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial support from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t constantly do this - everyone has his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour will appear on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls for A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to help you . &quot; they said we could install zu@@ cchini .
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s dialogue partner Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds himself of the village before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone , they didn &apos;t have the chance to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will take a little more &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is getting around $ 9 kids for every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage pit .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their fears .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy feels over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him .
he plays with the ball , which then rolls up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that provide an ind@@ ran@@ ce in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink blood frame and golden earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name M@@ om Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans that are on transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she wants to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she buys them medication that they can &apos;t pay , they mas@@ ked them with a bal@@ m that exhausted them from long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has recently arrived .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yoghurt @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move direction north .
the family had heard from other followers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that the Afri@@ cans are already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go back , &quot; he said smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests send their often text messages if they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling by tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and noted that the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on floors on the ground but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the Gobi and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work place in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he has fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail them without having a plan .
in Bra@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all@@ rounder , offered him its roof .
a few months later the family lives still alive and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers see their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests , much of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who gone .
like a proud grandmother she lives in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair st@@ ains that you made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs , she laughs , while she introduces her .
&quot; Ya is fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they are gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication units in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ Us@@ ers .
residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the District Government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is preventing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities can also use the app for more than the com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app in short time having exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app and the distribution of the terrorists would establish and track the distribution of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures in control of digital activities in this region .
while messages via digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , ad@@ orable ethnic minority regions , such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet de@@ preci@@ ation .
the media out@@ let &quot; Images from the China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; showed photos from a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen agree on how they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by way of growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( forbi@@ d ) , which has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the data acquisition requirement of a Windows operating system and with that un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to minim@@ ize the instructions of the city council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government branches , authorities and associations , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating its computer and communication units . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; by the local police register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is apparently to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a range of other possible progress , including those that relate to a peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything sh@@ outs after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you are looking at and make sure that you &apos;re completely alone on a place where everything is important .
everything went down and dis@@ b@@ anded ; the truth is revealed clearly , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to her name .
one who has reflected in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions failed to allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you look back the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and anything cri@@ es out after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubt solve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is on the axis of the disaster . you are clear that you have been tra@@ pped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to be stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been arrested for me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Chief of Security Studies it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he exhibited his power over us by destro@@ ying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , un@@ condition@@ ally , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city , which is fed into the arter@@ ies with national security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had some cal@@ ms down after the power supply in the quarter had to work .
I broke through the silence by crying out several times &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contra@@ dic@@ tory through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we lied to a magnificent picture that fully met my expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in such a moment , you are aware that you are free from the lamp , but just don &apos;t care in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after you have caused them all the way to the office of security from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ able enough , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ati@@ ful eyes stood up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are gri@@ eving you to look at the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity : perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I have never stopped to look to you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret my word from what I said .
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father at the same time . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months .
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I look forward to all details , before I cared for the room .
unlike else , they have shared a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and I can immediately sit without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old and tried communication method : to strike your f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ain@@ ees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a rep@@ utable man of middle age who looks like me and &quot; the doctor &quot; is called .
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized , and physi@@ cians do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers connect its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black saw the colour of the cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the 13th sands of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this was the secret to protect and prevent the state security before us and prevent the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their den@@ omin@@ ational black@@ mail and locked the close view of view of its world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the crime of their cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cared for the audit@@ orium and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is so afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can begin to close it with your life when you &apos;re coming to protest and protest against protests , who will soon find an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really tell more exactly when ins@@ ults and beats after a friendly talk has become an ordinary communication agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened , was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me told me that I had to get used to it , must be punished if I didn &apos;t do anything to earn this penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably st@@ ems from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker appe@@ ed to your cry .
give him pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry f@@ lowed not enough for him , why they cast out the tube by a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked previously as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had been inter@@ tw@@ ined by four wires in order to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed from them , while I was still in the series .
I had lost everything in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to crying .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down and didn &apos;t really favor that , why he &apos;s next to a electri@@ fied rod .
electricity passes my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect head of power .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
for a few hours that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must make a terrible wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoke a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the bulk of his time inside ; he l@@ ur@@ ks to his canvas , to his computer , and again to his couch .
what to leave , however , is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ st@@ ained lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in whom Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a ke@@ en activ@@ ist since the last six years , the conservative majority is transferred to gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian fav@@ ors , he also calls for the nu@@ cle@@ us of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that range from Damascus until the whole of San@@ aa .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can have a sense of people with the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he doesn &apos;t open it openly , it turns against the US foreign policy a special dis@@ like .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing of the second generation , &quot; he states themselves , even if he was born into Jordan , and never before was in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life@@ times , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs there in water for two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has been to do little with protest against Islam .
in principle the cor@@ ds speak very warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette into the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries .
hence , it simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in public during the Ram@@ adan water to land in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan recently cancelled one of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila again , for the second time .
some par@@ liament@@ arians who support the Islamic policy of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert is to be contra@@ dic@@ tory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MPs and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also asser@@ t the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which en@@ quiries the un@@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila comm@@ ons the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to settle for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply conf@@ using rhetor@@ ic , but actually an increasingly clear reality reflected in Jordan which clearly occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b worked traditional gender nor@@ ms by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women that vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen have sex .
the image shows a skel@@ eton of a obviously lower unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ ours &apos; has increased in Jordan .
according to Human Rights Watch , according to its climax , the number of hon@@ ours in 2016 reached its cul@@ mination ; however , that Jordan is missing its institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder , or domestic violence , to the appropriate manner .
according to a law on the frag@@ ile control in 1954 , women , who are exposed to the danger of internal famili@@ al violence , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to rever@@ t back to topics , which are long t@@ aboo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but dre@@ aming that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it att@@ itudes towards sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was initiated by politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and every other one is . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; this can get what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cen@@ sored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , later to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored by his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only an ordered version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not speaking to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory due to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks herself , if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , Why can Jordan not be able to do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government anch@@ oring attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian secret service took several former government deleg@@ ates and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they would have been critical about issues in social media that are deeply ing@@ ed with corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a permanent give and take . Jordan has now managed a gig in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes are happening by day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is becoming a real and fundamental op@@ enness in the region using music , art and literature - and not by bombs , stre@@ et@@ ables and artificial nature . at least he hopes this .
until it is time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b becomes more ra@@ p and therefore also resist@@ ing resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war pu@@ ppen are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus and were taken out of a period , in the army &apos;s armies mar@@ ched to the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big the parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are currently visible .
however , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fortress was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the Fris@@ ian .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where road noise and illegal drug trading are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - as many other medi@@ a@@ - and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports fans like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ men that can im@@ itate these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts against each other , to show who you can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks you can see in the following video ( other videos for current cont@@ ests there is on the public Facebook profile bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people of making her weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in hair@@ style art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ quit@@ ous ways dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
before the school year started in March , school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the borough of which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contri@@ buting &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this entry will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel ej@@ ected , bring affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged letters to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , its land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guer@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered the signat@@ ory of peace agreement as important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in front of Colombia , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ov , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war of war and carrying their arms around the clock , they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred compared to gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles , they have to record them in their ranks and support them during a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian would have joined together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who should be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for the reconciliation of the reconciliation originated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were able to talk to Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters , but those who need to need more necessary .
he plane , he told him to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent assur@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former com@@ bat@@ ants of the F@@ ARC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I would never have thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC emerged as they had done before in order to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they were not given orders , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s amazing how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
having handed over the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down , because next to him there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gren@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos; a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life someone has written something like this , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him , and sat down beside the Gren@@ at@@ cher .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I &apos;m sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything from life than war . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a society without the open arms waiting for us .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now wherever peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the opening , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as war and the F@@ ARC stayed in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC proclaimed the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and given insight into their views on the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this mag@@ n@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never heard so far and no election revealed , and to recognize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hated even people with beautiful feelings , who have turned around by their life@@ times and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality where the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who are killed and so much harm can bring us something to give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colombia has been proph@@ es@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament , peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities will always give people who are ready to gras@@ p himself and protest to their rights and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terr@@ ors , activists in the last few months have witnessed across the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and spoke to us what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q &apos;s legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya won several months ago the international news has been published after reports published the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and they entered into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , her was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safer place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced the sex administration of her country@@ woman , the hunt for Sabrina opened .
fear@@ ful for her life she moved to the United States last week .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , I told me that someone took my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate these shame . &quot;
then the photos from my documents went through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to catch some shopping bags from the seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still de@@ file the family , do you bra@@ id ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently , some women had received everything and started to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ utes in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which case , were you placed - in men &apos;s men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there &apos;s my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me for the women .
I am very grateful to him for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he will be respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I got threats from last February .
they called me , wrote me - relative , strange , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
we asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they showed absurd demands : some told me , I have to prove it up through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad things , and Photoshop .
I have gra@@ ins size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once talked about my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which is not only your family , but the whole republic has cor@@ rupted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she got a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window plates and a number plate was put on it .
after the third time happened , I realized that something was lazy .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them , without registration , without any identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I managed the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are using . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex administration , this is a t@@ aboo subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still bear in me .
I also wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier I can &apos;t overcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person , which she re@@ minded of her past , so on my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed behind ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed recent information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who had taken one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through blood flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now still gay men kept in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says there is not so many .
if , in particular , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they are kept there to present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Should they perish , they will show their bodies in television and asser@@ t them that they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people simply wouldn &apos;t simply have disappeared , but targeted specifically to radic@@ alize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison , after having grown their beard .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they have simply taken them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken .
until now , they were not introduced as band@@ its , but there were no reports to date . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why else could it not allow this man to shave ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings be heard of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ vil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately dropped us into the stone time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were kno@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
for me , the Department of Security of Sh@@ aria has never broken me on a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never ins@@ ulted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children , when they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes closed before you , because they believed they were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never hun@@ ted , and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came up with the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on TV about mor@@ als .
he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started in the city to change .
who had laughed and laughed at once , consider yourself with suspicion .
at the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the republic always wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I committed them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ tial Arts .
I don &apos;t read p@@ enny .
I discovered these people myself , when I per@@ tin@@ ted a refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to proph@@ esy with foam before the mouth , that there is no b@@ umps with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is annoying to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting until Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think in tran@@ si@@ vity of men who love men , and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a matter of action .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and do not feel ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all , so I know I &apos;m now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ moral within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the last few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ moral .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : used with permission .
a man &apos;s self @-@ combustion of a man called Jas@@ sim Mor@@ amaz@@ i , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab pedi@@ atri@@ cian community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , who can open in@@ ability for his family , as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken into the Tal@@ eg@@ alese hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ th@@ azi minority , and activists on site warned that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab pedi@@ gree was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and under@@ took great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy over the whole Iran .
there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region as well as some of the most experienced and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the locals gain only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime refused to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a multitude of dem@@ ms , water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
these dam@@ s have led only to waste the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate under the Arabian A@@ Hawai@@ ian young@@ sters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian CEO of co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , finished school in primary school , 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , said Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ moral amongst the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more serious . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will share access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who need to hide their pre@@ - and sur@@ name to be able to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ azi and not toler@@ ated as Arab name at the workplace , for speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , if the world is w@@ aking up and taking knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is an revised edition of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions came out .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be a femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women in spite of equal education still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation if it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that the cultural and social standards still ensure that women fall earlier or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced of it and I do double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ ders women , on black women in LGB@@ TI@@ Q @-@ community or on black women in LGB@@ TI@@ Q , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raise their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that there are an institution@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , that we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or that , women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with a migration background are often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black sp@@ ears and women with migrant background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all men of any kind of skin having the same rights ; on the other hand I cannot consider myself as a black woman , who ref@@ uses to consider in@@ justice in their mind as well as on the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented Sp@@ here which always has rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner accused 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join forces , which also absorb our customs and customs to promote their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to lay white women on the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to anim@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded in order to be a home to women from different femin@@ ism and alien@@ ated from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it to resolve me fully and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is ha@@ iled as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and join us into the spher@@ es that are created for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana bl@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ on@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) , in which we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed by the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called Separ@@ at@@ ism and mar@@ gin@@ alisation , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognised as part of this para@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither ski@@ pped nor ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
as part of a Content @-@ Sharing agreement , this article will again be published here .
again , Maikel Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission is target@@ ing people to realize the importance of clean waters to present and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of the pollution in its church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; explains Mus@@ a .
scientists from the whole country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - that relies on them and to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ s up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia von Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq @-@ based documentary filmmaker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filtered and edited .
the focus of their work lies on pursued , little notable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ operative video and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed churches , their stories to tell their stories .
Paraguay ays Women and her tou@@ gh@@ ty fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain about the women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region to express their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kurdish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # har@@ assed ef@@ smoking ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said , their statement would be laid down to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed that , because of mis@@ cre@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also useful .
a few days later the second woman went back to their ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women need to display at all once , they do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all of the prosecution authorities .
In@@ tri@@ 1 pun@@ ches and St@@ ati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible acts and a legal system that has nothing under@@ n@@ imm@@ ed imm@@ unity laws : good approach , lack of conversion and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to asser@@ t how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various information and reports which , however , show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the At@@ tor@@ ney General of 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % it went down to violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace . 86 % of ads added here .
in the ads , 40 % of women were physically treated , 55 % of women were talking of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen female minist@@ erial Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are also actually shown . &quot; on every woman who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ cre@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who are ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s mur@@ ders in Paraguay are not a criminal off@@ ences , the prosecution agencies have not documented appropriate , how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violent crimes by men .

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she was going to . this should always regret .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and has no longer been working with Carlos . but for two years , they en@@ du@@ red mental violence at the same time - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that I would be victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I read about it earlier , I thought that only women are happening to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana requested social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ic if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
the other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen from Carlos , and left him not before .
it almost seemed like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner is har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) that consists of women , all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities stopped with no result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed into an op@@ aque legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it went mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay ays La@@ ws : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of missions is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a member of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the use of laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 a bill of law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ sie ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ inv@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter sponsored by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law is looking to explain fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crimes and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points , so that the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law must be paved for de@@ preci@@ ation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , and can be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill had intended to cost the most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) proce@@ eding to carry out the victims of violence by themselves , if they just want to receive a safe accommodation , to impos@@ e a safe accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law should not be effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here a change must take place , so that violence is no longer viewed as a normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ ity and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will run away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to make so long ad , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed however . in this case , parts of the law had been changed , which was a passage in cases of domestic violence to be reconc@@ iled .
opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a huge set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after pro@@ hibition of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website has been locked out due to a decision of the information minister , &quot; on the official website of Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a sentence of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later returned again .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after he had killed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the chief offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of Defence , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of State and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persist@@ ently efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic intelligence , including press freedom , restri@@ c@@ ting and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , inti@@ mi@@ date and to be imprisoned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights , also activists , to express their views on public matters of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its founding in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief of Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties to the courts &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . in this , Cor@@ ruption , Cor@@ ruption , went into the judicial system and the import of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report government officials were accused of having committed judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in a her@@ ed@@ itary dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial department , was invited by the Special department , and was arrested by the security forces when he arrived .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took Deputy Chief Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who moved to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is as Chief Editor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed on in@@ definite time after the information minister had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; buried by the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a public ban and sl@@ ander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es at the level of 3000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one year &apos;s pro@@ hibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) , after completing the use of a information network to spread material which could be a risk of public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic troops ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set at the end of August 2016 and was released on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing held on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the jail term of his six month prison sentence from the central prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also picked up the decision of the ministry of information to conclude the newspaper A@@ zo@@ am@@ n .
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n to admit again , the newspaper looks after attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister asked for another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to establish its operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the acknowle@@ d@@ gement that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to make an end to the substantial injury of the press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Asian authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their job .
3 . protect the freedom of freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman ensure their righ@@ tful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of emergency measures , including directed ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully and solidarity , supported and protected against them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Image takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is seldom mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of health education , many medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have more serious consequences in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , the research that is carried out by African scientists will be able to develop their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Central Committee on the Research of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
when Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on HIV @-@ Virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I also star@@ ed a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion on the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers , instead of his own cre@@ ators .
the solutions that we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or come back here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water , and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public opinion about science and acade@@ m@@ ics in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very lim@@ iting understanding scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need for special science training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and security access to scientific expertise mentioned here .
the system that journals make articles access to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seeds will change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding a salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ din , the first plant grown by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was performed only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many sal@@ ut@@ ons he can get , limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t continue to use them for breeding .
patents contain not only for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to illnesses , a special red or green or cro@@ oked leaves .
over the past few years more such patents have been registered on more plants like cere@@ al or cart@@ ridges . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on always breeds salad , but he still needs no longer because its work is always more difficult due to its work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like I would lie in a river a cliff around which I have to ride . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents have to go far to Sal@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand in front of judgment , no one can breed a new sal@@ ut@@ ty , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes them as good as possible and tried to isol@@ ate those features he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a move that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source lat@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space Station in ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at in the &quot; glas@@ sm@@ shaus &quot; of the station . there we have been tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was initiated in life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bre@@ eders can be committed to themselves that others can freely use the seed @-@ free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , however , does not mean that they can &apos;t continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not allow you to cross it to become so own varieties , and it is not immediately ob@@ sol@@ ete - two aspects , which may be prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si management board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seed plays a role in greater inter@@ acts like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter , not only little by using seeds with natural resi@@ li@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why we want to buy control over seeds in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered for example to produce good , locally and sustain@@ ably producing vegetables , it should also know that the way that the vegetables is cultivated , such as the vegetables is bred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nutrition sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative undertake to provide other their seed @-@ free to their disposal . therefore , in contrast , seed and plant features are to be patented .

Os@@ si supp@@ orter argu@@ ing that the future of food supplies may be endangered because of the most numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available limited , un@@ ce@@ able shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , whereby it can be used for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aged plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots .
a question of view of view
plants are bred so far@@ med that they have purpos@@ eful features - of such , by which their taste or colour improves until such , because of which they th@@ rive in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders decreases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson , Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ ban@@ ken and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property restri@@ cts other bre@@ eders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the Protection of Plant Spec@@ if@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result .
such protection thus in@@ hib@@ its innovation not , but promotes it by providing the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants , which have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , you have already lost the struggle .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general pract@@ iti@@ oner , and it also should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on does not distur@@ b itself to the concept of using plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics ourselves .
plants are formed by themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea of how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large hum@@ ps and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation , her@@ bi@@ oci@@ des are needed to expand into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very gent@@ l@@ ent . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such companies move to international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents ) , there are most smaller seed companies , including without patents - either reject it or for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant of plant Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant patented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like me to produce new products , stronger than companies , the patented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog as I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a couple of years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent for 20 years , you can easily make it pretty simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads rapidly around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Center for Sustainable Agriculture Organization ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties , meet certain demands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell your own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for the bre@@ edings differ from country to country , absent for the Os@@ si obligation not just to be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November , 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , she speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventional plants .
one explanation is , however , no law ; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the Patent Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , is that the organization is currently launching a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official start .
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity around the world , to publish a seed map , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ es - a Associ@@ ate of relief organisations such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - representing the possibility that farmers may have the opportunity to share and improve the seed &apos;s supply to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report also the importance of a variety of local food supplies with seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection that the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods is particularly respected where and how much is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock the content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported about them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also never so important to impos@@ e this goals and to impos@@ e a vote in this part of the world , so it was never so important to overcome these targets to overcome the lock . we ins@@ ist to meet our task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first zen@@ ge website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera Network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to HR@@ I , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog was introduced to circum@@ vent the scep@@ tre of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider who also is home to Zi@@ adas blog , is still available .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces while he reported on the student reports and recorded a video as the police had trained physical violence against two students .
his article mainly revol@@ ves around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself on the lock by the government and reflected what it means for him :
the , blogs to block is very old , but has become a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been successful to give me the feeling of an executive board ; an arrest , an attempt to murder , un@@ loading blogs at the National Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other web site that I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have blocked it , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave are going through the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , inter alia Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the lock of providers driven by internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private brows@@ ers , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the lock of websites , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter them to filter to the Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is further wor@@ sen@@ ed that the deci@@ ding decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against justice against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the residents argue .

day reports in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures .
some of these lines are as follows :
14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ie@@ ves rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
at the heart of the economic crisis and in a sharp financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations .
reports , such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; That &apos;s not normal , &quot; in which it was not normal , a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any big city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex break , etc . everything , what happens by the civi@@ lized standard and what only happened in Rio , will call our way &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that , as journalists did not complete our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , said that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that didn &apos;t know the war .
the same video is a journalist in the newspaper , that according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 regions , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is aware that a war dis@@ course if it is dist@@ orted to be confused as well as the police , who only shoots , and then ask questions to disgu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it profits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to design@@ ate the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as showed extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with adequate investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ious negle@@ ct of public service .
for remembran@@ ce : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro is considered &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available .
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we see the murder rates per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to this safety policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police bombing .
at first , this led to a decline of violent deaths . for a few years , U@@ PP was able to protect against the poor con@@ greg@@ ations and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor mun@@ icipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux wrote from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio , as a war , raises profound consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this is calling on the state to use funds and paths that are typical of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her fact , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , is located in Damascus and surroundings , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib at present , around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons increased by hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition states , based on exam@@ inations concerning the United Nations and other human rights organizations that massacre resulted in the massacre of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2013 , these by rebel control areas outside Damascus have stood outside of siege , which led to the inhabitants of local or through tun@@ nels and control points of mu@@ g@@ gled foods .
by the years of block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat have become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food source &quot; food source .
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi do not belong to the traditional food @-@ planted foods and are only extremely rare in Syrian cuisine . however , her food makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we opted for cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for this project for three years , and expressed its relief out that it is now more and more to gain popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge about the plant@@ ing of mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 but will continue until Monday , 04 . September 2017 , will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel short@@ ages , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards she planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have mushrooms all over East G@@ hou@@ ta , free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute to the people for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self catering by food lef@@ to@@ vers ( e.g. paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for winning new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to insp@@ ect people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese : demand for justice for the victims of the 2017 Br@@ oth@@ s
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which were as@@ simil@@ ated in the next week in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires bur@@ sts that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o is a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite images , alone in Portugal alone amounts to about 500,000 acres of forest - a surface of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there are no fire in 4 districts .
Portugal is fully burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017
some of Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread across the web and show pictures that allow a better look into the happening :
the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to con@@ strain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al , the Federal Government of Portugal , declared the P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did this Sunday , nowhere : there are dozens of streets of open roads enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy like in June could happen again because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits are payable in locations with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extensive proposal on the Wal@@ lo@@ form which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , ended by the mun@@ icipalities which saw the new rules as barrier for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the government led an eas@@ ing of the law which allowed the construction activity of the case , when the applic@@ ant could be built into self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val succe@@ eds in the same article by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups who had defeated the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
at this time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at supper .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she couldn &apos;t see her son a long time - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Communist Party of Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly vulnerable .
the Taliban on the Haz@@ ara &apos;s well @-@ known Taliban came together ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself back in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his minor reward , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than he himself , to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ vo@@ af re@@ minded himself in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we worked on .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon from the open window so that we wouldn &apos;t be spo@@ res at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ vo@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and went ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k went to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ vo@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which shared twice on day food in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for the past asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation of the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording centre , if they officially put an application for asylum , which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ moun@@ af .
but his uner@@ ring life , A@@ shar@@ af , helped to free himself from these conditions .
after several years he had made different work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af hid his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast pac@@ if@@ ice .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated company , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of the Orient Experience , where the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals are far far beyond the Italian food industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave for a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same options like any others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also ador@@ ns plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their appoint@@ ments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
development to successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afghan people in this way .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : bills from Egypt allow control of social networks Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan and has been in custody for more than 900 days .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , protest@@ ed against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament will examine a bill which fore@@ sees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to use to use social networks , register within six months after the successful draft law at the website of the authority , subject to their complete name and ID number .
whoever failed this step would be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or penalty of a criminal payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty member members , is currently planning the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy commander filed a legislative proposal in which the tou@@ g@@ her pen@@ alties for the president or officials would be introduced .
Egyptian law is pun@@ is@@ hable by the president and state treas@@ ury . under the bill , such a reality would be pun@@ is@@ hable by prison and fin@@ es , so right wing experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would become a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been at risk for many years .
one striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who had been demonstr@@ ating violence against the military coup that led to the military coup led by the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan had waited more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison line led to human rights groups to bring the accused of the prison in the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups are unanim@@ ous regarding arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was given the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ un@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties for the journalist Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were arrested in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to perme@@ ated documents ce@@ ases
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chie@@ fly to a thorough action plan . Bes@@ ides plan was supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali by the corruption offered official am@@ nesty , unless they give away all un@@ just@@ ly preserved funds .
this document issued on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the formal plans to support the legislative template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources under article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press releases which journalists safegu@@ ard the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the Tunis District Court on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China force social media to submit their identification ?
according to new provisions on the State Council &apos;s information office , the users of social media in China need author@@ ization before they write or share news in social media .
in addition , the rules will also be specified that registration will be required with full real name .
analy@@ st claims that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments will be reached within social networks within social networks . it is until now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese network citizens have proposed this provisions only sel@@ ec@@ tively to protect these regulations in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state c@@ ens@@ orship dis@@ closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register on the state government as &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services that enables the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make them responsible for removing content and to force them on demand for user data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently owned websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ tre@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court locking Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish dish made the Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English speaking articles , the indications that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked , because it works to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to initi@@ ate a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop turning around
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation on increased surveillance powers , the internet service provider would force to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install Backdoor programs , the data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government has cons@@ ulted the telec@@ ommun@@ ications company and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation will remain until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
