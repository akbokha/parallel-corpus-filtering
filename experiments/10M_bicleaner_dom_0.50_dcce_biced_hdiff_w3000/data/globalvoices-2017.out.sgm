<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors picked up American authors and run its sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound impact on me, that I was a journalist, mostly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy by Julia Roberts as the Jura-student, which was the uppermost Federal Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it as if it's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming you can always be and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of same-minded people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very bad love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his torchiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain just as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet people responded to his testimony and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the republican elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party of nominating candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigots person? I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not kill Trump and his voters in line with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalists, who took people from all over the world, a deep-believing person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump Weltanschauung did not agree with the publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr who fights for their lives in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by embodied values deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump honed his way to the appointed republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the equivalent to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared either his racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as a race.</seg>
<seg id="34">To order the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and suggests a inability to understand those who act and think of another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes are not considered in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters think of which most of them have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country, which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commended the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Ospree.: much like" "" "White against all other ethnicities" "" "; word play made of white in recording to the White and whiplash, which means so much like slingrotrauma), as it was the great Van Jones called exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what faith or background you always have, America is called everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the white America's promise to and say: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rod, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your United States?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" enveloped the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anybody who do not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trump Country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places is not only changing the lives of children, but also a very tight connection...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds removed from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de Música (music bande) plays in the community: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra which with their musical instruments have a possibility to overcome her surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school of 100 students has become a central interest for the parish of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth gave such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the musical group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you will learn Day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located on the largest landfill of Asuncion in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with prepared instruments, made of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling line under the direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, Celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets and drums.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez recalls a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from the apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from recovered material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the nucleus - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork effectively fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The resituary occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this vessel had already been used to catch illegally sea fishing, before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset and slightly inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind of coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that were simply refused," "" "reveals Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crosses and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing) was founded.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries beside Somalia and Madagascar, which had then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information and stand each other in where it is illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to absorb it. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"" "" "" "due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which particular habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem may harm a delicacy." ""</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the Schneckentempo, with the information in real time, the actions are happening in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange rates of existing licenses for example, breaking up-breaking activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when moving on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in banned areas. even so suspicious road routes will discover that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show whether the involved ships have a fish catch, where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "" "" "countries that are against illegal fishing can, based on this information, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their harbours. and that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to figures from penalties, as in the case of the Premier." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing will not be worth financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales involving eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. amongst these, even those illegitimate fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among these practices include actions, such as sails under false flag, counterfeit Licenpapers, specifying Phantasienames, fishing protected species and fish in reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and do not use the weaknesses of a incomplete installation system," "" "Long." "" "a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say" "" "You should not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and exactly this legal loophole tries to conclude FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks which had counterfeit counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and found it wingless ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing on large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help the FISH-i to produce suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, also helps hide the illegal ships hiding them.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Head Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels. FISH will help you to find a criminal ship with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana. it offers a platform that can be satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "to join the neighbors to get a better picture of what's doing - that is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to the study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on the global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system permit the tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals but they also put off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to be used previously unlicensed, and hardly to reckon with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the participating countries involved in FISH, some 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tow networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

"" "security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia had its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used to tow the towing nets, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "take a strong sign with the take of measures against Greko 1," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano that was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man Quijano said now in the frame of the big La Perla Ribera proceedings in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined crimes committed during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folly, and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerie official. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was born in 1976 to 1978. he was a deputy commander of the intelligence unit 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors, who is charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and abduction of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the degree of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who said before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child, and how this child chose a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I was friends who was fighting for combat.</seg>
<seg id="217">All of them called it "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely divided in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a member of Kyoto, who was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Prefecture Kyoto apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had been reviewed by translators and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To transfer you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in motherly language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the output language - motherlanguage should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, French native speakers must translate the French into English - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not deal with English as a native language, the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost, or the relatively low number of English native languages that are Japanese to learn.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who do not have foreign employees even support companies in the company. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge become the best, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic sentences, which arise through machine translations, show that this technique can still not replace a human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulations in Japan, among them also the puzzling prints, often used t-shirts or pockets, are used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, from big companies or by the government which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In future the city of Kyoto uses a serial source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIN filtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay was accessible by a lock of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two further online channels. this also concerns the website, which transfers their meetings to the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local internet service can sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server enquiries certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked channel, was hired on Thursday, 6th April, when the VPITV-ameraman Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was arrested in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been reported to regulate the government's Internet connections: this means that the Venezolans of access to multi-media coverage is always more difficult in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household in which she was not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from university, she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house filled with pride over her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "those who have become something" "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one calls in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money gives her minderage son or her minderold daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange the child receives food, training and roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, however, is that the children need to work countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that may not lift up in the context of a contract that is not able to pick up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, referred to as Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations widely.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completion of her studies, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness statements, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, as the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated the Criaditas, is generally still silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "the family, who have their daughter in the belief that they will complete their training, improve their position in society and can" "" "do something out of yourself" "" "to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who accepts the girl with itself, and justify their exploitation with the belief that it would give someone a chance that would not have any training, and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the so far relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the confined in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín arrived in the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of severe blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military camp Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the local community.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck down with a stick to Marín until it suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the young girl's life.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She emphasized that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela, the deeply rooted practice of the Criadazgo was responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which conditions live boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil-social organizations demanded a generous examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina Marín could be a landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when her father worked, while her father worked, bankruptcy had to register and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work out to work on the street or on the market, sell money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that her time for learning was still alive.</seg>
<seg id="462">She was at five o'clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned up the living room, polished the furniture and desinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she had finished with learning, the more leisure time she had.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal minister Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation of Nature Iraq have decided to protect the ghostly chess leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards that matures through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and because they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows up in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wild way is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera team, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As educated Biologin, Raza is passionate about another side of their country, which exists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has also been a member of IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is setting up that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region will be set up.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the North American Japanese, Kahoku Shimpo, established the progress being affected by the "three-way disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a prefecologically prefectures in Japan's northeast, both of which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbourhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, as the tsunami had all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even though the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, but that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress of six years later, in order to rebuild the local life of local societies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding and survey results of the concerned itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction work in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shino-Zeitung reports that up until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings (in charge of charge, saigai kouei juutaku) was completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">With the biggest success amongst the three prefectures, Miyagi was experienced, 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima made its final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, they still endeavor to be evacuated by receptacle, evacuated by receptacle. (local charge, kasetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the Thirst catastrophe, almost 80 "000 people were forced to live in shelter workers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such shorements.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the Hungarians living in Fukushima still live in notifications, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuates had been evacuated after the disaster in shelter, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahocu Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the misfortune, reopened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the airports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, only 30 percent of the fisheries in Fukushima have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident resulted in the three prefectures of agrarian land-wide.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmland from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima happened well again.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima still can have only 75 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared to the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper led many surveys under the native population and below the evacuation. she questioned them concerning the status of reconstruction and as well as you have changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more information about the tsunami consciousness under the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local population who took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in cases of disaster prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung increased its attention also to the situation of the evacuate from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was a witness of the worst, disasters caused by atomic disif ever experienced in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated buildings from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, which had been resettled in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuated cities are getting older than 50 years old. they are known to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this is the project's project projects that will be part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba included the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - unknown, regardless of that there are no notable sugarcane on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were lame in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After excavation, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually remained in steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo-steamer, which is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not robs his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane plants in the east of the region, after a long inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remember that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstands the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, lack of administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvesting has been no more curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stiff of the church looked at even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on production on most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">"" "" "" "the motives which lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market." ""</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar prices rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and agricultural organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as a soldier is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory is the word that he repeats most," "" "fraud" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion, not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the first year of success, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official documents which were removed only regarding the parts which would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">They were all signed by Ulan del Toro, only the minister was able to approve each withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the tackled factory for two years and he was one who received letters. "the country had no money for the still operating sugar cane."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the feeding of the factory, whose construction he helped, involved.</seg>

<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut talk of October 21, 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youngsters of First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of travelling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour since 2014, workshop manager mobile Tongyms bring directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in discussions like" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptable" "" "or whatever comes into mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of KitCalkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street stage in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared, or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is recorded, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved here were helped by Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group who gave them a rophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan the strophe is available in transcription, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow, and just like our youth.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, will be displayed close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (public, "" "" plastic models of the dishes "" "") from each dish that is served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes, and decide whether to enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo District of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce the plastic dishes which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually so usual that they do not even notice them. a new trend, however, transforms its current cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual twist with the shokuhin-puru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic coating, decorative cell phones, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitschy collective objects, as in this case, cooling disease magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few showering coolers for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food items is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile-cell support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also made for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple who holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there somebody who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic coating can also accept a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the form of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handyards from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurrile plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to know more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which will focus on the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is attached or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he will become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people listen to the "heroic deeds" of the offences, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is as if they mourn for those who have lost someone and those who have fear them so much.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to be bare numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the insomnia of man is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighboring village that they were" "" "upright" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes sown, tortillas warm and "chichi" for babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood was ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, who had been shot dead bodies of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders for public safety and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and entering into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories still live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>

<seg id="842">Many were torn, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army gun in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military in Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram military (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the count of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to receive and dignify the language variety of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin, in Australia, or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages will not be passed to the born children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we have to create towns, the diversity - secure rooms, in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often is linked to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "to appreciate, to make, build." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers do their story first in their own language, or translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Although the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and their presentation make sure that the audiences are intercepted.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou conates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of tales for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Beak of the Rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked," "" "How is it speaking to a public that doesn't understand your language?" "" "he shares his sense of inclusion" ""</seg>

<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who inspires by the project can engage with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, published last year, was released and licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book would educate how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected to which this is connected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on site to see through the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted in the Adra-Prison directory, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives a voice to his friends and his family, who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was taken out of the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown site.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer of Noura Ghazi, reported that" "" "military police Bassel referred to as" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who used himself as an insiders of the Assad administration and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in spreading access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently transvershadowed the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of basing cultural prototypes were more predominant than the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This tripping into digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with him, to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually stopped in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a trial, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together for the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the spider in the moment we embrace us,</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (the Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65.000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, at least 17.723 Syrer had died in prison according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, Principal Conduced following provisional release once again</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique was reacted with anger on a corruption case, with which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of Mosambique from Mosambique before the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good leadership and demanded immediately his re-setting in the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which took the request, there would be no obstacle due to Cambaza, to acquire its old post, since the company had no disciplines after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not give the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we notice is that the company should have a disciplinarisation process against the listeners.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm seems to have an adequate legal step for the application of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well and considered the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had eaten.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science says in Brazil, the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already been so massive to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morale and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself to the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a hand it turned around an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man is weary, charged and ultimately condemned to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, lapping and - incidentally, Prophetic Redner.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the grid because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" "" "Indian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook addresses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Kalar" "" "as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hassé in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely decreasing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalist as a hate speech against Muslims who pose a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to combat Hassal in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself calls not automatically calls out Hassal.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have been discussing the use of the Word or have doubts over the use of his usage as an expression.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Beyond that there are several burial words with different meanings which have the same book sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written to Burmese, also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spages), 'Kalar Oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooky Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on spirituous way, if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by playing a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - resembles a racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Halls is the opinion that they decrease Hassal radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it deleting all posts, which could spread across the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook clears the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "the automation will not understand what you are writing on Facility." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should happen instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(age)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "the good thing is that these triangular nationalists, spreading the Hasslanguage, get a pretty good lesson." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "while the promotion is able to send a strong signal to all the hasslanguage, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proved that the censorship of catalogues often becomes a catfish and mouse game, with the users to use social networks simply to use a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung's Myat described as Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new guideline from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "" "Facebook Community standards did not slip." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative intentions, or just try to show their opinions against the Hassays radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asked for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "such words are to be called only more hatred within the different communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started this without any local context or technical support and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out, they did not have mistakes, they did not try to rectify the fake posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they were just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would make them big sales, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured for a lot of ridicule among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it serious, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hasslanguage to see if their posts are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook posts, which won't contain any hassals, but they have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his failure to bring out Hassling harassesses to his Burmese pages under control.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as a part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care to express the name of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns, saying "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give women to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should be abused for the norm to maintain this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of OUa by a pseudo-court and expelled from their family and village community after having responded to a married family.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of wives also do not name their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear, if any, they shouldn't come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff, and housewives, a unique club and were thus quickly to the main interviewing theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss and discuss the fines of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is involved in the removal of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working with the help of her videocamera at the discovery of practices, such as children's homes up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infested, and heads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women, and they simultaneously have made ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in its discussion group was women who do not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided on this issue because they wanted to open the interview about Patriarchate with a problem where women can easily identify with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands don't say aloud, is a custom that they all have fully invoke and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition relates that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't holding this will be regarded as a misty, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought of this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, had never called upon the name at home, as it runs at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "". "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected mainly girls and women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked them all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, that they may not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries old tradition, in which married women never allowed to speak out of their husbands "names.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that she was just before the whole exercise; a different one decided to leave the whole early frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in adrenaline pumping over, with an ancient brilliance, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law she was stared, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, indicating the status as:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would bear the cinoberred point if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped complete with it, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip on every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I do not want the women to make up those who hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last few months she celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and spoke about things which they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have been linked to some things, for example like our identities on our husbands, never said to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is that okay, but some wanted to carry a saline-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of conflict and discussion about the advantages of his own coat-choice, the morale connected to the saris and much more, smuggelte Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa while they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they are going to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a couple of times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now carrying Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in a discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the rush order to reach more freedom of movement or his own coat-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realize they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks in the club and other people about it what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo did attention to the international community after his lawyer was announced in late June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancers in the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (citizen of state) after he participated in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year, Norway. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to go back to China, since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee brought his hope for a conditional release to the expression and invited Liu a to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to receive his prize.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark in the blogosphere has triggered a debate.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting in the international branch of the State Association of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised Dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... No one asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "turning the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian proportions of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, we hear that we are not able to be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a must-breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons made by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' because of what he inevitably appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York alike, equal cities that are permanent from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the Thames, the good old lyre appears of the authoritarian rulers, who pretend democrats, the distorted logic, as it fits better to her power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">For appropriate questions, he cloak with non-responses of rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country our city belongs...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take up the effort to stop this point where he was paid highly to be part of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his comment on the blog, he tells of the reviews that you should begin to read the full address of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the testimonials of Shanmugam better, according to Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven important, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these towns looked for decades a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore is not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Minister of Justice said to Singapore very much..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which is expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and consciously is what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the vulnerability of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam "benevolve an error" or was it a Freudder spokesperson?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabin, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of major importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapureans pay their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister Invoice?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In addition, the journal Journey of a Decade tends to the affirmation of Singapore, and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence appears to have annoyed a lot of Singapurements...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that often as" "" "hear the defense of the country, especially" "" "etc., but this is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification then the default answer is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadian cook perhaps inwardly in rage when they are held for Americans, but me does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible on their rucksack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American, however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1768">"" "first: as" "" "nice" "", "means to be skezed in essence - such as the benevolent, soft, but tragically significant figure Ned Flanders from" "" "Simpsons" "" "(which has its own Canadian double devils)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, is inconspicuous and ininteresting to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from the things going around a around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a major issue of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral-pink blood frame and golden earrings in a teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication that they can't pay, they masked them with a balm that exhausted them from long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has recently arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move direction north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other followers of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together and that the Africans are already speaking on WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go back," he said smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests send their often text messages if they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling by tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and noted that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on floors on the ground but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the Gobi and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his work place in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmail them without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Braachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an allrounder, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still alive and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers see their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests, much of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she lives in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair stains that you made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="2070">My cry flowed not enough for him, why they cast out the tube by a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked whether the investigators had worked previously as a garbage collector, or if it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had been intertwined by four wires in order to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside; he lurks to his canvas, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What to leave, however, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year, in whom Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Hdaib has been a keen activist since the last six years, the conservative majority is transferred to gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian favors, he also calls for the nucleus of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus until the whole of Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can have a sense of people with the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he doesn't open it openly, it turns against the US foreign policy a special dislike.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian" whispering of the second generation, "he states themselves, even if he was born into Jordan, and never before was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own lifetimes," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he pours there in water for two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has been to do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle the cords speak very warm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette into the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it simply avoids basic things to do - as in public during the Ramadan water to land in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan recently cancelled one of the band Mashrou's Leila again, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic policy of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert is to be contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MPs and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "" "" "many also assert the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, which enquiries the unproven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila commons the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to settle for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply confusing rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear reality reflected in Jordan which clearly occurs in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib worked traditional gender norms by giving his vision of the fate of Arab women that vorehelichen have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows a skeleton of a obviously lower unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honours' has increased in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, according to its climax, the number of honours in 2016 reached its culmination; however, that Jordan is missing its institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder, or domestic violence, to the appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fragile control in 1954, women, who are exposed to the danger of internal familial violence, "and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to revert back to topics, which are long taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but dreaming that he is his music that is full of explicit attitudes towards sexuality, freedom and expression of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was initiated by politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other one is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "this can get what you want" - be faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgram Roya, later to memorize that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only an ordered version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals is not speaking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory due to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks herself, if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, Why can Jordan not be able to do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government anchoring attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian secret service took several former government delegates and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they would have been critical about issues in social media that are deeply inged with corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent give and take. Jordan has now managed a gig in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes are happening by day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them that" "" "they are experiencing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is becoming a real and fundamental openness in the region using music, art and literature - and not by bombs, streetables and artificial nature. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is time, Hdaib becomes more rap and therefore also resisting resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war puppen are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus and were taken out of a period, in the army's armies marched to the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where road noise and illegal drug trading are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - as many other media- and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports fans like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressmen that can imitate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other, to show who you can create the eccentric Looks you can see in the following video (other videos for current contests there is on the public Facebook profile batalla de Barberos).</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contributing "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel ejected, bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged letters to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, its land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatory of peace agreement as important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "but in front of Colombia, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakov, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war of war and carrying their arms around the clock, they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred compared to guerrilla struggles, they have to record them in their ranks and support them during a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian would have joined together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters who should be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of the reconciliation originated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian were able to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters, but those who need to need more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told him to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent assurances.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC." "" "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "" "they say." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never have thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC emerged as they had done before in order to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they were not given orders, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's amazing how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having handed over the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him there was a MGL-Grenatcher, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It 'a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone has written something like this, so I answer it. "then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him, and sat down beside the Grenatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I'm sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything from life than war. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the starvation. "I would never have thought someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without the open arms waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now wherever peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the opening, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war and the FARC stayed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC proclaimed the history of the organisation, their ideals and given insight into their views on the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never heard so far and no election revealed, and to recognize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hated even people with beautiful feelings, who have turned around by their lifetimes and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality where the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who are killed and so much harm can bring us something to give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombia has been prophesied that after the disarmament, peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities will always give people who are ready to grasp himself and protest to their rights and that is completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and spoke to us what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ's legal situation in Chechnya won several months ago the international news has been published after reports published the deterioration, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, the suspicious queer men and they entered into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>

<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitutes in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case, were you placed - in men's men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there's my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he will be respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats from last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relative, strange, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">We asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They showed absurd demands: some told me, I have to prove it up through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad things, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grains size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked about my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which is not only your family, but the whole republic has corrupted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she got a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with a darkened window plates and a number plate was put on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time happened, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without registration, without any identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I managed the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are using. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sex administration, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">I also wish to overcome this seelic barrier I can't overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"" "" "" "I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person, which she reminded of her past, so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed behind?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed recent information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had taken one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so that I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require evidence that the so-called" honor "has experienced" "" "honor" "" "through blood flow." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still gay men kept in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says there is not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, in particular, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to make Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are kept there to present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they perish, they will show their bodies in television and assert them that they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people simply wouldn't simply have disappeared, but targeted specifically to radicalize." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison, after having grown their beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports to date. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings be heard of people who heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately dropped us into the stone time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">For me, the Department of Security of Sharia has never broken me on a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't be over the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, when they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes closed before you, because they believed they were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted, and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on TV about morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started in the city to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had laughed and laughed at once, consider yourself with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">At the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel like the situation in the republic always worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacreffs, gatherings, I committed them to hospital and help them to get Essential Arts.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't read penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I pertinted a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there is no bumps with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which cabardiners have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it is annoying to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting until Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transivity of men who love men, and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a matter of action.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and do not feel ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all, so I know I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of self-moral within the impoverished Arabian ancestor community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the last few months there has been a strong increase of self-moral.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">A man's self-combustion of a man called Jassim Moramazi, the desperate situation of the Arab pediatrician community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, who can open inability for his family, as Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was taken into the Talegalese hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahthazi minority, and activists on site warned that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab pedigree was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and undertook great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy over the whole Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">There are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the Ahraz region as well as some of the most experienced and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the locals gain only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of demms, water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to waste the devastation in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate under the Arabian AHawaiian youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian CEO of cooperative, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who completed a job, finished school in primary school, 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, said Global Voices, that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-moral amongst the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become more serious. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will share access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">"" "" "" "this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who need to hide their pre- and surname to be able to hide their affiliation to Ahwazi and not tolerated as Arab name at the workplace, for speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activist alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, if the world is waking up and taking knowledge of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said, their statement would be laid down to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed that, because of miscrement, Ada Báez was also useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman went back to their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women need to display at all once, they do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all of the prosecution authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace. 86% of ads added here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women were physically treated, 55% of women were talking of psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen female ministerial Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are also actually shown. "on every woman who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychic miscrement, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Image takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of health education, many medicines and vaccines, which cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious consequences in the poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, the research that is carried out by African scientists will be able to develop their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the Director of the Central Committee on the Research of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water, and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of public opinion about science and academics in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limiting understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special science training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and security access to scientific expertise mentioned here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals make articles access to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddin, the first plant grown by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was performed only by his own ingenuity and the question, how many salutons he can get, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn't continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents contain not only for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to illnesses, a special red or green or crooked leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more such patents have been registered on more plants like cereal or cartridges. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton always breeds salad, but he still needs no longer because its work is always more difficult due to its work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like I would lie in a river a cliff around which I have to ride." ""</seg>

<seg id="2638">And when they stand in front of judgment, no one can breed a new salutty, because all the features are already patented. "he makes them as good as possible and tried to isolate those features he wants.</seg>

<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, whereby it can be used for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist, but experts like Luby suspect that massaged plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so farmed that they have purposeful features - of such, by which their taste or colour improves until such, because of which they thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto's spokesperson, Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four genbanken and co-operation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "she contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, since" "" "patents and the Protection of Plant Specifers" "". "" "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection thus inhibits innovation not, but promotes it by providing the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow on plants, which have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, you have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general practitioner, and it also should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton does not disturb itself to the concept of using plant features: "we do not create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Plants are formed by themselves and as breeders, we have no idea of how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large humps and monocultures, for whose cultivation, herbiocides are needed to expand into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very gentlent. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such companies move to international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents), there are most smaller seed companies, including without patents - either reject it or for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock the content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported about them.</seg>

"" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first zenge website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page of Mada Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera Network because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to HRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt on the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog was introduced to circumvent the sceptre of the Egyptian government, even target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider who also is home to Ziadas blog, is still available.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces while he reported on the student reports and recorded a video as the police had trained physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly revolves around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself on the lock by the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to block is very old, but has become a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been successful to give me the feeling of an executive board; an arrest, an attempt to murder, unloading blogs at the National Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other web site that I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked it, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave are going through the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), inter alia Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the lock of providers driven by internet censorship and private browsers, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June we noticed how the lock of websites, which VPNs, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">"" "" "" "such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter them to filter to the Egyptian users." ""</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is further worsened that the deciding decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against justice against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The residents argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army is used in the favelas in Niterói, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day reports in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">14-year-old shot in school, "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered," "Thieves rough pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">At the heart of the economic crisis and in a sharp financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports, such as these are daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the Editorial "That's not normal," in which it was not normal, a new category called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any big city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sex break, etc. everything, what happens by the civilized standard and what only happened in Rio, will call our way "war in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that, as journalists did not complete our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, said that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that didn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video is a journalist in the newspaper, that according to data from the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 regions, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "us is aware that a war discourse if it is distorted to be confused as well as the police, who only shoots, and then ask questions to disguise." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it profits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued to designate the violence as "war." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as showed extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with adequate investments in personnel, education, and a historical and self-complacious neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">For remembrance: the federal state Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro is considered "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília false: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most recent data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Globo company, the largest media company in South America, such as Cecília, has repeatedly been repeating the security policy of the State.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To this safety policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, was to capture a favela by using a massive police bombing.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At first, this led to a decline of violent deaths. for a few years, UPP was able to protect against the poor congregations and repressions against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux wrote from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio, as a war, raises profound consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this is calling on the state to use funds and paths that are typical of a" "" "enemy" "" "in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and to the object for" "" "collateral damage" "" "and" "" "confused balls" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her fact, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week now, it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the favela jackarezinho to take revenge on the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident was made headlines: a fruit seller then died as a result of shots, which had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon from the open window so that we wouldn't be spores at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Avoaf left his life without papers in Iran and went ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark went to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Avoaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which shared twice on day food in need.</seg>

<seg id="2902">So it was Amounaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unerring life, Asharaf, helped to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years he had made different work in the construction industry, Asharaf hid his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast pacifice.</seg>

<seg id="2920">Ashark's goals are far far beyond the Italian food industry and retail, and aim back to the country that he had to leave for a teenager as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
