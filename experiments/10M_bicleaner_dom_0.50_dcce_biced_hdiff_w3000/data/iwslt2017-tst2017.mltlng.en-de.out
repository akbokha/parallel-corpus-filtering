that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone had heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it spectac@@ ularly published that the NSA report@@ edly heard illegal teleph@@ ones by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service operation in which the CIA had literally translated the Iranian dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapters ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the design of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and spy on journalists .
according to First Constitu@@ tions , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen , they will cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government compet@@ ed with R@@ isen , he did something many cour@@ ageous reporter had already said before him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused , and said he would rather go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , even though they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can still hide less .
instead of failure and aw@@ nings , it might also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and thus the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got worried about his telephone calls ,
just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its lending , and even travel links with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and risk to condemn .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower when he joins . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convicted than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as ge@@ heim .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to journalists .
so we put the pres@@ ume on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more possibilities to share all .
but just as technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can record it from the moment in which they receive contact , rather than in the after@@ math .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source conversion system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet famous , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working recently .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency access .
so the government cannot get information secretly , and many of the information they would like would not be available .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new es@@ pi@@ res technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it &apos;s time to ensure that not only technology makers such as Edward Snow@@ den have one way to deposit iniquity . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the excess of abuse during the supply of soldiers were modest and reported by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm will be poll@@ uted by Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data sheet of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &apos; Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; dis@@ covers that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge money should have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; This week we were asked by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag@@ ged Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sad Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that an associate of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others giving nervous on the next release and wait for the next release documents .
it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping away from you , my ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is , when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , global wid@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from a few few are used to hide their assets , to veil@@ s -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ k@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company has a firm in another company , in another company what it is almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the US .
probably because so far there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
could we have a datas@@ he@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US States to get less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children .
it has allowed bet@@ ams to zoom in particularly an@@ di@@ ly inc@@ ru@@ sion .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does this work ?
so we sent out a covered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister , the suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions on a lawyer &apos;s lawyer , how he could move his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ occupation . none of these lawyers accepted us as client@@ ele , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but this is the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer , with our covered investig@@ ator proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not about a single leading politicians , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change rules to make this kind of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as though it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen forward transparency to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind this .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress which we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy , who rise up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparent laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da would be landed .
a day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he got the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
&quot; &quot; &quot; what am I doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to be kidnapped in the luggage boot of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Do you like me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the blanket and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild horse sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I was afraid that I got out of bed , on ti@@ cking tips to the door , and my sleeping door shut down .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me , is now on his classroom today . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view@@ point .
perhaps people , who were sold as a stranger in childhood , were actually friends who were waiting just to be discovered ?
to host people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us make a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create it , fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have gu@@ essed what we could deserve . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I switched on .
did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ mer , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly posts and their bedrooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closed when visiting .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild@@ foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but they did not act .
nobody who is still at comfort is allowed to invest in a business , the strangers are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we learned , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one gets on the things you can well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , what degree do we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet An@@ gles of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only so , who now has Al Go@@ res &apos;s cell phone ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is the President of the President ?
you can now return mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have imagined once with his name ; if he had told where he is coming , how his dog or his children ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you should have 150 figures that are all saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can hold up really well un@@ locked cell@@ phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ thought feedback system , trust strengthens the trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative ratings .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their permission before being online .
we discovered something new last week .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are related to the age and living area .
little surprising we trust the people most , most like us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ sur@@ ised .
it becomes exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out com@@ mon@@ alities .
so , the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ference .
in addition , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you give away .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you tell little about how &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great artwork in your home ! I &apos;m doing my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to create it with design , create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of text area to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips on which themes have to write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers .
with which we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third , a need which had not been covered before .
the shop is just very good for us .
of course there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests , who were not allowed to celebrate parties or homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I got along the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts , if I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the aller , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves .
fortunately only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million remained a problem .
for people trusted one another .
if trust works , Wonder@@ ful may arise .
one of our guests did vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to attack heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you drive a hospital in your own car if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer , without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay starts .
but this relationship behind the pure money transfer are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions combined ?
it is a economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply not just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself open , and that changes everything .
if one travels nowadays , it is possible to compare fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if trips were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be , if at any place you visited a group there would have been waiting to be thoroughly ref@@ illed and to show a pub pent@@ at@@ our neighborhood , which one has never heard of ;
or when cooking could learn from a five star chef ?
nowadays flats are arranged according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would have thought of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , has already been started . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
are now residents offered . students who were looking for a stay there ,
were medi@@ ated in people whose children were moved out . there were incub@@ ators started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host .
the idea does not seem so crazy as it was taught us .
we have not invented the wheel .
there was a lot of hospitality before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has just worked our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it amaz@@ ingly amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da drives me over .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a credit@@ or ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay on the security angle at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are making people look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met another Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker - double Espres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am an pract@@ ising , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head @-@ cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist independence declaration which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents only .
I have with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and eventually believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion , deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you completely understand and yet love ?
it feels like that .
later I got married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and living in the essence of the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Express . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flo@@ ats in buildings , people jumped out of buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into indig@@ nation .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u turned the actions of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat and I was afraid to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , and I read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be deceived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims are gathering at prayer .
and again the warnings again : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , and killed them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
but something really felt right .
because people who attacked this land , attacked our land .
I pushed the anger of people into the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain itself to itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can really hear people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is located as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our just under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are like all other Americans , not tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the inventor and teachers , el@@ es@@ el@@ ers and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque brings people to consider other faith toler@@ ant , and major citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are being radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even by her family , so that the extrem@@ ist groups may believe that terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establ@@ ishes its brut@@ ality with the cor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sac@@ red Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
a prominent Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only put them in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that would make sense of their anger , it was a major target for the instrumental virtu@@ alization that you promised a solution .
this Im@@ am introduced the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear changes every day to our democracy ?
a study , actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one considers test messages , in which neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they were more likely to vote on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims .
that is not just a academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the lead of Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of public in order to offset the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurt us all .
with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only meant to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both were going to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did such a young man have become such a sealed young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne in her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had arrived in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he enjoyed eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism cannot be fatal , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not easy decision , because it was because America would leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we opted for the mosque .
we went to the mosque with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw I would stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to help us .
at that moment , I broke collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go safe to number ?
or you &apos;ll connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you are saying to those who may say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thinking with deep immersion , such an exception , and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m usually as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever running study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
if people appear as an exception to the rule , then usually the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to be a billion dollar store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air package enters into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six @-@ metre tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting connecting flight machines high speed and acceleration to close space .
they can also build self @-@ abra@@ sive structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react to natural laws .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
to work autonom@@ ously with a system , it must know collective accus@@ ation , where the mobile objects are in space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors , to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest layer . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other rac@@ ers it is efficient , efficient , more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most rigid gl@@ ers it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the plane no matter in which position can be reg@@ ained and improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract questions to the core of the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest number moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts , which accum@@ ulates to hurt you .
decades ago , pilot controlled pilot flying pilots could fly , which had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est air@@ man . it was invented recently .
it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bar , no other actu@@ ators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter . to bring it to fly , I have to do it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it right correctly , if everyone looks to me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in the event , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this Trans@@ lu@@ ence ?
they see that he is not symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the au@@ sp@@ icious capability ,
moving into space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even like rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be displayed in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our daily , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers aircraft .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise
and the others against clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also constra@@ ined .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines Syn@@ thetic Sch@@ wär@@ me .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we commerci@@ ally available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as it &apos;s over , wants to become a fle@@ dged lamp@@ shade hanging on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the salary in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , as wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that it allows creative , smart tastes to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you .
around 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes traveled in a very far away galaxy so much more quickly , they turned into pure energy in a t@@ enth@@ s of each other in pure energy .
for this short moment they radi@@ ate bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we &apos;re talking about black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time awareness and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us examine the events at first time .
just before 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has brought a lot : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God is standing by -- even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector by a huge laser detector , which arise after gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , that arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people stopped them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation was financed by its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometric monitoring Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the recognition output enorm@@ ously .
therefore call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by several smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ ared the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that , what I had worked for , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been resear@@ ched for 23 years gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , such as lig@@ o @-@ measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a sp@@ itting of space and time .
when passing through the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched out into one direction and thrown into the other .
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ turers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead a really warm dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on 14 September , for example , each one of us stretched out the waves and thrown out . the strain of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of this , the Lig@@ o employees declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s just absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of a nuclear strike right . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text above Gra@@ vit@@ ation
by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are huge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists have been fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to be Lig@@ o &apos;s more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical . because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by allowing you to perceive the light around you .
in killing it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks &quot; Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stup@@ idly Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we can &apos;t make any easy pictures of objects in space .
but by listening to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are available for Lig@@ o .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear the universe literally .
the gravity to listen , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ates simple : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cu@@ ffs with an additional sound change . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu wu !
it is a kind of movement set , st@@ amped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No one who knows what he must hear , this is as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold sun @-@ mass , which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : we &apos;re thinking about what this means .
two black holes , the most common body in space , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it , because we &apos;ve heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to study the universe as it was never possible .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- virtually or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about everything .
but the exciting physical events take place in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see through , as these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine will shine through its own glow .
through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
indeed , Lig@@ o found the same thing in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the suction bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to achieve a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and l@@ ur@@ king the noise of the universe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is time of great dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I for@@ cing myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that which I feared , removed my fear .
my fear , to keep speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah , which changed my life deeply , on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me whether I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on , I swear to play with them , as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wherever I go , I say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am driving very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sessions saved my career to play with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things , aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible to carry out about 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , time four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
in the world , my series in 256 regions will run for 30 million viewers in 67 languages .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments I created myself , and not only produced , so still pure . I must find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to tell my fans about the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV shows , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world .
do you know who else does this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of you who work so hard on whether you are now a company , a country or a classroom , a business , or a class@@ rooms , so you understand that I am not only on the computer and fant@@ asi@@ er , and it &apos;s true if I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not going to dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is when I set up troops , as painted on a canvas .
as a dream one has a high tone , then a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically and inspiring , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working is going well .
a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sound like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people suppose I told them the Sum@@ men , that I speak about writing that writing is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I started to work and work with television production , when I began to work and work , build and cooperate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the Sum@@ men !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the Sum@@ men is music . the Sum@@ men is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t strive for size .
the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ men .
or perhaps it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not for failure , and I only know I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it in question .
to make a clear question : the more con@@ sign@@ ments , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work is , the more things at the same time , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , right ?
the land I was sc@@ ary , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the great sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the Sum@@ men . I am the Sum@@ men .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Listen , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum of the engine was speech@@ less .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the Sum@@ men did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing Titan ,
everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ p you , stupid author of the author . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a girl who knows what the Sum@@ men feels like when the Sum@@ men stops when the Sum@@ men stops , who is then you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song ce@@ ases of my heart , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
it &apos;s no longer calls &quot; swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ ers . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I hate it , when I &apos;m Titan and my Sum@@ men bet@@ r@@ ens , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters to@@ ast , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and absence of Sum@@ mon , I can &apos;t do anything except to match .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country that I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist any more .
everything that exists is sticky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , al@@ tim@@ acy and the song in which to let go lot , or whatever the girl is released in &quot; The Queen &apos;s Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I &apos;m at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the work h@@ um , the Titan@@ ens@@ um , that is just the substitute .
when I ask you who you are when I say to you who I &apos;m when I describe with the broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the Sum@@ men is not a force and it is not unemployed .
it depends on the pleasure .
real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum is the current , which comes from life &apos;s desire .
true sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are at the experiencing tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s back .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me not just like working , like working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at work as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , as what kind of man is rather working than being a home ?
well , yes , me .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of it is .
we move around in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we blown soap bubbles .
thereby I feel mostly st@@ iff , absent and confused .
always mature after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask : why have we stopped working with playing ?
you can too ! tell them always then yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me na@@ ï@@ ve for a meeting .
well , you are right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and speaks my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes with me , am I mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no longer need it .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no linen , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children will get ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ feeling , my world . it is not the children to feel , to feel a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out it and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I am th@@ wart@@ ed and I triumph@@ ed . friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training as I wanted to exceed even more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
works not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it has changed its way back to new ideas . I use it in full swing and love my work .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men isn &apos;t me ... no more .
bubble and sticky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just part . and so I am so grateful .
it is me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem is playing .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in a grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I set up , the marathon which I run , the troops , the linen , the sum@@ s , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ m@@ men , the Sum@@ men of Life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , disgu@@ sting , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things off , I wake you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us , Neu@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures .
surely , they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; low@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; it im@@ plant an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with something help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was Senior Consult@@ ant and working day and night in the emergency room .
often I supply patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that brain trau@@ mat@@ a perme@@ ate the brain and inc@@ lined the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save lives , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted cells to grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
leaving cells from a tissue growth is comparable with very small children who will be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to th@@ rive them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from be@@ aut@@ ology that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active - they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called the Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ rum block cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain behind us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells exactly cultiv@@ ate how it did Jean François .
and then , mark them in color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we planted it on the decision of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ spl@@ ant -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are allergic to these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are feeling the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they would go back home . the space is already occupied , they will not be needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added an injury to and anti@@ bodies exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
here , of course , we could not stop .
can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets of one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we spent the motor mot@@ ic motor in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recover up to some degree , just like a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , you see the monkeys that re@@ covers spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we planted the cells , the same monkey , two months after the mature plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us .
since that time we found very much more about this cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance at Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain does the means to heal itself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatment and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you must re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his major im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a th@@ ri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is van@@ ishing with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ introduced Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not imp@@ acting the austerity policies that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for a true democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of mis@@ belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without democracy , our societies are reported to have our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies .
as a matter of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently endangered our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one peak is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , who throws its long shadows about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt mountain ,
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest it , where it would be productive and income , which you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that hum@@ ank@@ ind is urgently needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro , 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office building , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars might be compared to a lot of money until it was compar@@ ing to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the ex@@ changes and to rub the real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds within the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not be investing in which they could kill him . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus &apos;s father , who could kill him , that his son would kill him if he is growing up ,
un@@ will@@ ed the circumstances suggest that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my Ha@@ ze with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely lav@@ ish article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of community in which the Free and the poor serves as a majority the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy in course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these clas@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and it was not only the right to freedom of expression , but it is more important and crucial to them that they have the right to political participation with the same vote in questions of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is burned down quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , the liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for Herr@@ sch@@ ende .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , while the economy - so the world of corpor@@ ations -- a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , and the economy gradually inter@@ mig@@ rates and em@@ ailed them .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about being able to be in the government today , and still not in power because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a flock of prey , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they are feeding , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the politics grows so far beyond the self @-@ created economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of corpor@@ ations grows , political goods will be exploited , the economic situation is growing , and the business management of corpor@@ ations are to be fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well@@ being of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintain control , such as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ian left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing the low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure we have a unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ on@@ acy which leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he has brought forth -
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the human being in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines will serve human beings , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ean &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would you need to look like , this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; novel utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to mention some examples in the future .
in the company &apos;s area : ask for a capital market , where you work and in which your capital is to you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter who you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all income from capital and revenues come from er@@ ections and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those who belong to those who are not working there , and employees working there , but the company does not belong . no exchange between investment and sp@@ ears , and ultimately no big g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ears , and ultimately no empiri@@ cal twin summit .
in the area of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free variation on exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the whole world trade is acted in this currency -- call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that is equivalent to the trade deficit or the national surplus of the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are stra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a unified politics and business .
the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ate where she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marx@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the garbage dump of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar to yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
in your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , the technological development will generate a massive decline in overall demand that Larry Sum@@ mers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long term stag@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly working .
BG : actually , and now we are probably too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who told you . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers have said you very clearly what you are keeping from the view of the West in China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy in politics , whereas the area is where most of the economy - a completely democracy @-@ free zone .
in a sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to that of the 19th century England .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was especially scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what to do now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now preparing to do what the West has done in the 19th century is a massive , to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very dis@@ appointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial line proce@@ eded by the Eurozone , and continues to cross the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
right . unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European Group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try an economic system that is not viable to get life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism a while , but if the change enters , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what transformation do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone is not a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est juice ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims that he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of credit@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they just wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ver@@ ification proce@@ eded by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of credit@@ ors who imposed this policy imposed on us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from somebody who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , they are demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have a cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences alone for Europe but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we plan to introduce ourselves to a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able to the future of Europeans , as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select anything .
he must find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that turn right on this bend .
this curve is the application arrangement of over 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; The Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows you &apos;re ad@@ di@@ cted , where , after you che@@ wed a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are you more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what about this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to submit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle aging , the average television -- the shows that are neither good or bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so , he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something that is why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online , where everyone can see any of them for free .
and if Amazon does free stuff , you guess it is correct ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know they will be observed in watching these shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts you start ski@@ pping and look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average but not just what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of an event , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , whose course they like , etc .
then they use these data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x ended up having a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this bend . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , personal data sealed .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic fails that it should work with everything .
if you collec@@ ts millions of data for a decision that is hit , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
one optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste which one can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so it is somewhat fri@@ ghtening , because we live in a time in which we are living more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the TV .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software ever in contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here and for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data diversi@@ fied firms are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can predi@@ ct data analysis of flu , bad way -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news . the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publishing in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are self @-@ tested firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data flows through life - at the workplace , in case of law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genetics -- an area where some very wise people can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatments
&quot; &quot; &quot; or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized some samples via the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , you cut this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the items back together to put a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the pieces again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think , was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for what else they would not have been able to put together all these parts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and making it a show like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that does not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas then they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision , because they always could say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better choices but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll find it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more expres@@ sing , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic setup .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this than encouraging news , that despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks to enter .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
