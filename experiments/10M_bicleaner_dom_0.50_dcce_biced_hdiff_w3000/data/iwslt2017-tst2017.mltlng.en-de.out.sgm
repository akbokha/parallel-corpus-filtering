<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it spectacularly published that the NSA reportedly heard illegal telephones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service operation in which the CIA had literally translated the Iranian drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapters?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the design of the government, whistleblower to condemn and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutions, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen, they will cost.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "so when the government competed with Risen, he did something many courageous reporter had already said before him:" "" "he refused, and said he would rather go to jail." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">So, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they were for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and awnings, it might also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus the investigators, without his consent, got worried about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its lending, and even travel links with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower when he joins. but instead the judiciary has more convicted than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as geheim.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result that a whistleblower went to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the presume on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more possibilities to share all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to circumvent rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can record it from the moment in which they receive contact, rather than in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source conversion system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet famous, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working recently.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot get information secretly, and many of the information they would like would not be available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new espires technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's time to ensure that not only technology makers such as Edward Snowden have one way to deposit iniquity. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The excess of abuse during the supply of soldiers were modest and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm will be polluted by Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data sheet of the history was published.] [the 'Panama Papers' discovers that the rich and powerful] [huge money should have been hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make a statement.] This week we were asked by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mosbagged Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossad Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an associate of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others giving nervous on the next release and wait for the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, my ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, global widness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens from a few few are used to hide their assets, to veils -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryokkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has a firm in another company, in another company what it is almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because so far there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a datasheck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US States to get less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed betams to zoom in particularly andily incrusion.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent out a covered investigator in the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister, the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that everyone could make suggestions on a lawyer's lawyer, how he could move his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preoccupation. none of these lawyers accepted us as clientele, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but this is the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer, with our covered investigator proposals." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading politicians, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change rules to make this kind of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforting, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as though it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen forward transparency to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at the national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress which we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy, who rise up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparent laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally stop the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He got the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "what am I doing now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to be kidnapped in the luggage boot of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Do you like me?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was in bed, I stared to the blanket and thought:" "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild horse sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I was afraid that I got out of bed, on ticking tips to the door, and my sleeping door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me, is now on his classroom today. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people, who were sold as a stranger in childhood, were actually friends who were waiting just to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have guessed what we could deserve. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I switched on.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharmer, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly posts and their bedrooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite wildforeign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at comfort is allowed to invest in a business, the strangers are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we learned, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one gets on the things you can well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, what degree do we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet Angles of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who now has Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined once with his name; if he had told where he is coming, how his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine you should have 150 figures that are all saying:" "" "he can hold up really well unlocked cellphones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-thought feedback system, trust strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative ratings.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their permission before being online.</seg>
<seg id="176">We discovered something new last week.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are related to the age and living area.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pressurised.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So, the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you give away.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell little about how "Hi!" you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell a lot, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- "" "" -- the request will not be accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great artwork in your home! I'm doing my family vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text area to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips on which themes have to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests, who were not allowed to celebrate parties or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I got along the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts, if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the aller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately only a fraction of the 123 million remained a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, Wonderful may arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests did vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to attack heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one life, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a hospital in your own car if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay starts.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationship behind the pure money transfer are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions combined?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is simply not just" "" "rent industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels nowadays, it is possible to compare fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if trips were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you visited a group there would have been waiting to be thoroughly refilled and to show a pub pentatour neighborhood, which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when cooking could learn from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are arranged according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korea's capital, Seoul, has already been started. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now residents offered. students who were looking for a stay there,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated in people whose children were moved out. there were incubators started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was a lot of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just worked our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the stock of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it amazingly amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda drives me over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A creditor? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on the security angle at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are making people look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met another Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>

<seg id="280">I have with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and eventually believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion, deepened with every reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you completely understand and yet love?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and living in the essence of the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Express."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes floats in buildings, people jumped out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into indignation.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu turned the actions of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, and I read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be vigilant," "" "stay in well lit areas," "" "Don't be deceived." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims are gathering at prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings again: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, and killed them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I pushed the anger of people into the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself to itself.</seg>

<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is located as a whole and a benign tumour just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, not tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are the inventor and teachers, eleselers and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque brings people to consider other faith tolerant, and major citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are being radicalised in their cellar or in the bed front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even by her family, so that the extremist groups may believe that terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at them, they do not drive on what they read in their" "" "Sacred Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only put them in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that would make sense of their anger, it was a major target for the instrumental virtualization that you promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear changes every day to our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study, actually several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one considers test messages, in which negatively reported about Muslims, they were more likely to vote on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">That is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulation of public in order to offset the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurt us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only meant to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both were going to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did such a young man have become such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had arrived in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be fatal, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not easy decision, because it was because America would leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We went to the mosque with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you are saying to those who may say that you are a TEDTalk, a thinking with deep immersion, such an exception, and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I'm completely normal.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to the rule, then usually the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists, is about to be a billion dollar store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package enters into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France live a six-metre tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting connecting flight machines high speed and acceleration to close space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-abrasive structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens to deal with turbulence and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">To work autonomously with a system, it must know collective accusation, where the mobile objects are in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors, to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest layer. e.g., "start" and land. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other racers it is efficient, efficient, more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most rigid glers it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">Limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the plane no matter in which position can be regained and improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "during our research, we often introduce fundamental abstract questions to the core of the cause." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest number moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts, which accumulates to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, pilot controlled pilot flying pilots could fly, which had only two moving parts: one propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest airman. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No claps, hinges and crossbar, no other actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. to bring it to fly, I have to do it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right correctly, if everyone looks to me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in the event, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this Transluence?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the auspicious capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving into space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even like rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be displayed in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our daily, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propellers aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also constrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines Synthetic Schwärme.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as it's over, wants to become a fledged lampshade hanging on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the salary in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, as wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it allows creative, smart tastes to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">Around 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes traveled in a very far away galaxy so much more quickly, they turned into pure energy in a tenths of each other in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they radiate brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We're talking about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time awareness and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us examine the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just before 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought a lot: coral, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God is standing by -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser detector by a huge laser detector, which arise after gravitational waves, that arise through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people stopped them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation was financed by its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometric monitoring Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved the recognition output enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by several smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves roared the two collious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that, what I had worked for, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been researched for 23 years gravitational waves, such as ligo-measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a spitting of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing through the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched out into one direction and thrown into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for the theory of relativity often lead a really warm dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each one of us stretched out the waves and thrown out. the strain of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st of this, the Ligo employees declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's just absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of a nuclear strike right. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text above Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">By Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are huge.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists have been financially and with the support of public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims to be Ligo's more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can produce a picture or a map of things by allowing you to perceive the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wave length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks" Alice. "</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupidly Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can't make any easy pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by listening to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are available for Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulates simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very quickly, you hear the same circuffs with an additional sound change. that sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement set, stamped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender sound] No one who knows what he must hear, this is as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold sun-mass, which rotate around as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we're thinking about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most common body in space, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it, because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a completely new way to study the universe as it was never possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- virtually or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about everything.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical events take place in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, as these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine will shine through its own glow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Through gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, and of whom we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, Ligo found the same thing in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to achieve a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and lurking the noise of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "we need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of observatory on earth and in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible to carry out about 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, time four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">In the world, my series in 256 regions will run for 30 million viewers in 67 languages.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments I created myself, and not only produced, so still pure. I must find time, really stille, creative time to tell my fans about the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV shows, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world.</seg>

<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>

<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard on whether you are now a company, a country or a classroom, a business, or a classrooms, so you understand that I am not only on the computer and fantasier, and it's true if I say: I don't understand that it's not going to dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops, as painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream one has a high tone, then a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically and inspiring, funny and disturbing, clinically and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begin in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sound like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people suppose I told them the Summen, that I speak about writing that writing is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- when I started to work and work with television production, when I began to work and work, build and cooperate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the Summen!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summen is action and activity. the Summen is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Summen is music. the Summen is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summen is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not for failure, and I only know I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear question: the more consignments, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work is, the more things at the same time, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, right?</seg>

<seg id="638">I need the Summen. I am the Summen.</seg>

<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned.</seg>

<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single worker.</seg>

<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summen did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps not, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, Neuchirurgen is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely, they have heard of one of the most famous, the "lowenhirnstimulation." it implant an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was Senior Consultant and working day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supply patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain traumata permeate the brain and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to diminish the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Leaving cells from a tissue growth is comparable with very small children who will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from beautology that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active - they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called the Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebrum block cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain behind us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then the cells exactly cultivate how it did Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, mark them in color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planted it on the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are allergic to these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are feeling the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they would go back home. the space is already occupied, they will not be needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury to and antibodies exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here, of course, we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we spent the motor motic motor in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hands anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recover up to some degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, you see the monkeys that recovers spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we planted the cells, the same monkey, two months after the mature plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found very much more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for instance at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain does the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatment and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you must reprove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is vanishing with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I reintroduced Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not impacting the austerity policies that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of misbelief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are reported to have our future gloomy and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">As a matter of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently endangered our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" twin "" "" paradox. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="916">One peak is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, who throws its long shadows about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest it, where it would be productive and income, which you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humankind is urgently needed, for example" "" "green" "" "energy." ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office building, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "3.4 trillion U.S. dollars might be compared to a lot of money until it was comparing to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the exchanges and to rub the real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds within the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not be investing in which they could kill him. just like Ödipus's father, who could kill him, that his son would kill him if he is growing up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwilled the circumstances suggest that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haze with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "its extremely lavish article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and particularly to finance the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of community in which the Free and the poor serves as a majority the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy in course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy due to these clasps.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the judgment of the Athenian democracy was, and it was not only the right to freedom of expression, but it is more important and crucial to them that they have the right to political participation with the same vote in questions of the government." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is burned down quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for Herrschende.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, while the economy - so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, and the economy gradually intermigrates and emailed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is about being able to be in the government today, and still not in power because the power is migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a flock of prey, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they are feeding, decimated that they are starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics grows so far beyond the self-created economic crisis." "" "the power of corporations grows, political goods will be exploited, the economic situation is growing, and the business management of corporations are to be frightened to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism is the" "" "demos" "" "of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wellbeing of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "maintain control, such as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing the low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we must reshape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure we have a unified area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocronacy which leaves the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Therefore, the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievement that he has brought forth -</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the human being in "Star Trek," in which machines will serve human beings, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenean "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would you need to look like, this "Star Trek" novel utopia rather than the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to mention some examples in the future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: ask for a capital market, where you work and in which your capital is to you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter who you are currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all income from capital and revenues come from erections and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to those who are not working there, and employees working there, but the company does not belong. no exchange between investment and spears, and ultimately no big gaps between investment and spears, and ultimately no empirical twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a free variation on exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the whole world trade is acted in this currency -- call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and every government pays the sum that is equivalent to the trade deficit or the national surplus of the respective country." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are strar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a unified politics and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe to you is at the same time liberate where she prefers privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the garbage dump of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar to ystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">In your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, the technological development will generate a massive decline in overall demand that Larry Summers" "" "long term stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am perfectly working.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are probably too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who told you. BG: in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers have said you very clearly what you are keeping from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy in politics, whereas the area is where most of the economy - a completely democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to that of the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What to do now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preparing to do what the West has done in the 19th century is a massive, to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to self-complacency, and the permanent denial line proceeded by the Eurozone, and continues to cross the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Right. unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, within the European Group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try an economic system that is not viable to get life through political will and authoritarianism a while, but if the change enters, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what transformation do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone is not a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest juice...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims that he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of creditors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the verification proceeded by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that turn right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application arrangement of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bath," The Game of Thrones, "The Wire" -- all the shows you're addicted, where, after you chewed a season, your brain asks: "where are you more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what about this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to submit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle aging, the average television -- the shows that are neither good or bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something that is why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online, where everyone can see any of them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon does free stuff, you guess it is correct?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they will be observed in watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you paused, which parts you start skipping and look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of an event, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, whose course they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to figure out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix ended up having a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this bend. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, personal data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic fails that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data for a decision that is hit, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste which one can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so it is somewhat frightening, because we live in a time in which we are living more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software ever in contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data diversified firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can predict data analysis of flu, bad way -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news. the success was culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publishing in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are self-tested firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data flows through life - at the workplace, in case of law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very wise people can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatments</seg>
<seg id="1109">"" "or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized some samples via the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated." ""</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you cut this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the items back together to put a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the pieces again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think, was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "they use data to better understand their audience, for what else they would not have been able to put together all these parts," "" "House of Cards" "" "and making it a show like" "" "House of Cards" "" "that does not stand in the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas then they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision, because they always could say," "" "This is what the data say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better choices but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll find it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more expressing, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic setup.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this than encouraging news, that despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
