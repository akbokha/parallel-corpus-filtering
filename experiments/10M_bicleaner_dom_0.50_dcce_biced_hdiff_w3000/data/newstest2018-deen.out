Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your ga@@ ze to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are going to meet today .
a tomb which is now being dug out for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers produce the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not current .
everybody knows this , who had to get an exciting one , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed up a green meadow instead of a re@@ b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer by Ge@@ op@@ ort as Bavaria of the state government , are everything else but current - yet very interesting .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then how cities and con@@ greg@@ ations have changed in the area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas , which is not equal to such .
in the large over@@ sight card , detailed maps , so @-@ called primitive data leaves , were incorporated .
these were produced according to the Bavarian State Administration Management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and replaced the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
their client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition of war with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
eventually , when French troops returned to Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 1801 , there were the neighbours of today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische survey@@ ing Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the certificate for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is how all others can be found on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the country &apos;s capital .
the city expanded in all directions and has grown together .
for example , the send@@ ling is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map , i.e. 1877 , in the district of Munich .
today the w@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where is the West@@ park today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : during the view a smaller piece with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written pre@@ ju@@ gs from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
there are no small par@@ c@@ els there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of the send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since the 18@@ 10 stage of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal leaf , one reads only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ ights .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Irish &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ens . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der headed the facility - the psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and finished the chains of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who employs an exhibition with An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients first place was first place , and later was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district ir@@ ren@@ facility in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s , has been there since 2006 .
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet up in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order bought a building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth centre with vocational training .
west is the TS@@ V Munich football pitch , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built into architectural shape on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big one remained until this day - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ber chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day will take the pre @-@ work and take place on 5 April 2017 on the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn sign .
with the shooting eg@@ ler the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Union to fo@@ ster Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people who are due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks in the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who have to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a series of frag@@ ile , ra@@ ci@@ fied inci@@ dents occur in the entire state and listed here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which crimin@@ alizes people to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the State that aim un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group to publish the travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have injury of civil rights , people happen .
they are stopped or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard nor heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has exhibited for a state in the USA .
the group organised inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after having no longer had any fuel during the journey through the state and was accused by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without having a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black motor@@ ists will be more frequent in the state 75 percent more frequently than whit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring along the money , or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ break in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation program of the FBI , which levels the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel warnings is also an answer to a new mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after immigration authorities have adopted immigration authorities to ban people for immigration problems , according to the AC@@ L@@ U on further race pro@@ filing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent years , stak@@ eholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the dec@@ eit project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn@@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will be continued coming next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU out of the CDU and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac issued a picture on @-@ site .
at the right @-@ excav@@ ation of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the fishing Federation of CDU met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ demann best@@ owed an insight into his company where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as well as many k@@ ittens and accommod@@ ated in five flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him of alternative marketing issues for the milk of its cows , so swi@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday building only regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary pro@@ ar project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; elementary pro@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not be able to generate steep faces .
the green space for a lot of work , much needs to be processed using the sense sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the topic of top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and used them without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ lizers , even if he does not perform a bi@@ ogas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
you hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of surfaces could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thoughts about how they continue their farm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in cr@@ iti@@ que because of promoting
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants .
the open surface area is 40 hectares that cannot be hosted until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of € 71 was promoted by half over leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
consequently , the farmers stopped 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ er@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land ma@@ i@@ dens it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape @-@ care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of inc@@ iner@@ ary .
the aim is the closure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR collected funding is essential .
in addition , the fenced area may not be worse ( slopes over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
currently , the request of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the closing area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack these statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic tom@@ t in a h@@ it@@ ty dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ ters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators had laughed at him when he had done it .
but it took their importance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta replied , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which en@@ light@@ ens the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tly right , but how he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance to the rebel@@ li@@ ous words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the nu@@ cle@@ ary of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your troubles , your poor , and longing to breathe freely , to breathe freely , / the end of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; falling waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - were very good that they had completed a high political action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it long from the right wing .
the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative , that bring the American flame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is said to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not to light up the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ nai@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the true sense that the world is looking for people , seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue spoke to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but the hatred that is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
championship 2017 : Neil Black is pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the UK Teams
Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle is re@@ minded of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish con@@ sensus in the world championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will contribute to a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develops something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak with people in the Scottish institutes of sport and think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m , while Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ dh is quite modest .
her captain &apos;s talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that Ei@@ li@@ dh produced quite naturally were magnificent . &quot;
the Com@@ monwealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has set five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , one after a great season , which included victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships , as the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the men &apos;s capit@@ als says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team but in some cases even at the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about team capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , who belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as cap@@ tains ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking critics over Facebook : throw you not for a public post , if you do not have to fuel up elec@@ ting voters
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers beat him because of the Dom@@ estic Policy up to its political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ s in cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he has not brought his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan who work to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and er@@ ased their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained from the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Government &apos;s staff ent@@ ailed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s very important when it is a guy like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can Governor , in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with his voters and playing his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the government &apos;s side - which is considered officially a public forum , which is considered officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the govern@@ ance and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of Tro@@ l@@ len or mo@@ ose @-@ filled people that sw@@ inging the wh@@ ip online .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ ogan .
and they are just genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll .
they all said that their comments will be respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest has cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD , was not bott@@ led , but she asked for H@@ ass@@ ail@@ break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , though a number of people on the same issue will be dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees of govern@@ ance as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook generation makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you had done the same thing that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical positions and to burn , burn , or demonstr@@ ators to silence .
but that just happens digital .
H@@ ogan is not the first public official who critic@@ ises his Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ est@@ ones in this question fell into Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County dis@@ closed the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Let@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for its use on Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers hide between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail@@ boxes hit the lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms , like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers and Washington &apos;s decisions made .
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her silence .
freedom of freedom , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ course belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty hopes to domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days at home comforts , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led to the final round in Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the end of the end , before he lost Paul E@@ ales to the new venue and serve as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he put this place .
he is an avi@@ d advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open since it was taken from the program after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour following his 50th birthday this year , returns to the promotion .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .

less lung cancer through passive smoking
fewer people died of lung cancer in the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) occur in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer failures can be attributed to pas@@ si@@ vity every year , &quot; said Study Manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 .
there were still 400 lung car@@ cases because of passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered very complex

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the area of house connections be the position more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the underground a lot of hiding places , which is not reflected in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rules in the ind@@ el@@ ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the p@@ olls with ze@@ al@@ ous , washed hands is taken and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where they also carry out their daily work , such as clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , there were no fields assigned .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it may be too dangerous to work : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there is the soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the hig@@ hl@@ ands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which was touched for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta who manages the control of the region and foreign journalists or ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as part of the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo sticks , and out of corrug@@ ated roofs , which were converted by R@@ ost into different yellow sounds .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner are foreign .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans called a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her alive , hand woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and its bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s ster@@ ity@@ - and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is Indonesia &apos;s gold .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a hig@@ hl@@ ands in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollar .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military has retained a ch@@ oked presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort &apos;s local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian claims after greater autonomy do these golden leaves and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , over 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide in the 1970 @-@ year period .
in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % christ@@ ian , but the demo@@ graphic development change , as there are Muslim mig@@ r@@ rants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it was the native of Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ tan , known as Jok@@ tan , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and the rights violations in Pap@@ ua for his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changes , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , expecting to fulfil our hopes that justice becomes restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October a low point .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a c@@ lash in their sound and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building was set up by the nearby government commission and the things escal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1.000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered for a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre for justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting bows and carried out the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ strain .
some demonstr@@ ators began to s@@ cour@@ ge stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; means it &apos;s not released in an official document of TIM@@ E which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els from En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and asked for a lot to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said to TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but say that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name , the TIM@@ E in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the k@@ illings were first filmed on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case instantly solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister H@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for laying historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto has made a retreat when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the R@@ anto , charged the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that there were more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have been included in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with severe dis@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting houses did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police enjoyed the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to hospital , died one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ b , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died in the hospital .
in front of the company &apos;s location , the vill@@ agers was protest@@ ing .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by dam@@ aging warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing a killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so panic that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and was witness to the injured one here , so the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself in my house two days . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers for account@@ ability and withdraw the police squ@@ ad from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green hig@@ hl@@ ands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) joined the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by pushing transporting attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian troops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai over the past few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never emerge again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a portable , &quot; forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a paid only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually ev@@ o@@ unded to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , to raise the limit of coverage in order to promote transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ ans states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Salom@@ onian Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and common violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically seen O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there &apos;s free media so that it is difficult to conce@@ al the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people on site want more foreign governments to consider this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke out on May 4th and ad@@ ressed him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua says that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ committ@@ ees , &quot; Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe .
he wants to know that Jok@@ tan knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
in spite of the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led a last symbolic act of fear : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain around the police and the military station .
they know they might never come down justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible persons .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers of Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second brand that swe@@ eps in only two years through the tower , which is called random tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up with the alarm and the cri@@ es of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident named George An@@ ab , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) b@@ anded the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the victims .
the incident can have questions about safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the covering , outer cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation , came .
in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and covering at the London Gren@@ fur Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , it was only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single @-@ single on two odds , not only supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although they are often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics remain the tradition@@ alists so far .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries voted for reform , the purpose of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will continue to work , to improve the application .
after the vote , after many requests the proposal had already come to a neutral place .
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the first round of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round .
to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places etc will be reli@@ eved and the players will have to complete less official media appoint@@ ments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ ellers does prohibited items into the plane , finding a survey
a survey among flying documents resulted in more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration by ding@@ y , among them at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally used kni@@ fes or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they would have discovered that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers should use the rules .
of those question@@ ed that they had tried to fly to something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , which were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that have been deliber@@ ately drawn to T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent of all reported items reported by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male survey@@ ed confirmed that they had been inten@@ tionally depri@@ ved of forbidden drugs into the plane .
the company said that it was question@@ ed travelers throughout the country to find out how many s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers have taken cap@@ s@@ ware by flying safety and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - by safety , those who were most frequent .
however , the company points out that T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain where liquids they may take , or how much of them .
thus , there is no surprise that the greatest amount of the objects banned from T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a time , people thought T@@ SA could have books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k uses the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has thus under@@ lined that some of the clients had already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the usual triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has just betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ ancing number for the first time in the recent quarters of the recent quar@@ terly balance : the cancellations made for the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k was often advert@@ ised with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now , Mus@@ k gives a : a total of 5@@ 18@@ .000 pre @-@ orders had already been with@@ drawn from 63@@ .000 .
critics always pointed out that they were merely indic@@ ative reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 ) and in Britain &apos;s 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation process . &quot;
currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts are present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the cancellation of so far has around twelve percent of all orders to be a problem , however , does not believe the Tesla boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year Tesla delivered 8@@ 4.000 vehicles .
2018 it is supposed to be together - all models - 500,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you order a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla manage to drive his brand new , never in the practice of tested production lines without any major inter@@ ruption with maximum load capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .

EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves forward because of the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , refused to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state authorities in response to the present managing states .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Ministry of Appeal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that ran on October 1 for States to keep the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ floor zone o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would take care of a year to study his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engage in local decisions or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in Oklahoma in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , was a reliable opponent for environmental protection regulations for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regulations or delay , which contra@@ di@@ ct chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the newest legal notice for the immediate roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ car@@ et@@ akers had exceeded his authority , as he tried to guard the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which undertake oil and gas vent@@ ures to monitor and reduction of meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply put forward the read@@ iness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the states due to the complex process of fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under prior managing the EPA has often kept the dead@@ lines for performing , and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in case of trial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt had to use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a comprehensive new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month of the draft law , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the intervention was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General pro@@ secutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had su@@ ed the coalition of the states that the EPA had su@@ ed in this week , the Group plans to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our claims - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and more than 115 million Americans , who flows directly from the smo@@ g who flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants , and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and environmental prot@@ ections gained a surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying as much pressure needed to get this reasonable step by the responsible for protecting the air , which we in@@ hale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump Government to adapt to environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
abor@@ ators celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , on the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ our will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 16.@@ 30 .
its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made our friends and supporters of their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique little treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to Tum@@ our Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate according to the document , on the Tum@@ my mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , was located next to the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , national sett@@ ler of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 . these historical events are under@@ pinn@@ ed by the year 1600 .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was formed in early medieval origin .
a Lord who built up a church , and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the right to put a priest or the bishop propose a new priest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two collapsed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ den@@ sely .
in 17@@ 96 the French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler until 1869 .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 a storm threw the bell tower and the half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only today existing tower remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as a successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite themselves on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
designed by com@@ bo of the Kepler gymn@@ asi@@ um Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
he is talking to the local term Hartmut Rom@@ ann .
the program begins at 4.@@ 30 p.m .

Verein wants to test permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal condition for the construction and therefore turned aside to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association is calling for Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved as at the time , only at the border line to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal existed at a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the wind power to the rest of the municipal area .
the zones are to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the town Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier due to a change in the area of wind turbines in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the Düsseldorf district court did not appro@@ ve , because of a lack of form@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirements , the author@@ is@@ ations for approval is un@@ lawful and thus decre@@ asing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council again opted for wind concentration in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; an approval from the District Government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Erk@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the place of permission for the establishment of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant writing has been received for past week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it on the occasion to check the matter again .
however , it is likely to lead , however , that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the administration court , the circle didn &apos;t want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the arguments on Thursday due to the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four ever 200 meters high wind turbines .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen took part in the city , was close to lease agreement with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households will be covered - this is equivalent to a fifth of the power requirement of all four households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ berg district .

Tr@@ ump translated tran@@ scription of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary walls
phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump ordered in a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president ch@@ imp@@ elled him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project .
the tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ key have also been published and contained a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ key that a trade for the US refugees , who emigrated to Australia , would be ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence of Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after spending a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ st@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists of the rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es came out to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ lying - a man of middle age in a needle @-@ suit - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
the in@@ mates in fear fell inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
silence torn off the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was just a post@@ appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the crowd met very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists go back to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were gel@@ ded by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really un@@ predictable that in all these years there was no one person arrested , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts them in the organisation of post@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Congress ( Georgia ) and a long @-@ term citizen of civil law .
for him , the post@@ ing is as a dramatic call for action and presents a yearly memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want pro@@ secu@@ tions , we want the termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation till we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of jurisdiction puts a du@@ et on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI documents , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ trial .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remained on the loose foot , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , made a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice , Georgia made its vote for the first time in Georgia to vote in their vote in the summer .
at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI , the black Far@@ m@@ guard , Roger Mal@@ com came down a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight , allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore , she didn &apos;t come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white Land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they moved away from prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and arranged the k@@ illings , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in murder , and cleared the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it more pronounced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you sign up and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual post@@ age of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , by which many believed that he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ x because we then be confronted with its ugly face in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of black - in a room and listening to Gre@@ ene had started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the boss Cl@@ an@@ mit@@ er for years , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors performer Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the tester as@@ cri@@ es and urged him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said that he was away from my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a disgu@@ ises the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; one of the other black actors .
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly since the energy moves in space , a sense of camera weight replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everybody is busy doing this really , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , clothed with a fun@@ eral dress , stands on the corp@@ ses of actors and leads cheap holidays g@@ utter praise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is split almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced po@@ ison@@ ous moisture for nearly eight hours if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you found on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels fl@@ atter@@ ing .
when the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks in their heads , register counter@@ feit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mur@@ mur@@ ders a little boy , as if he will remember .
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x section and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who played the member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks down in her arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience put together with the actors for dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ted on a table , suggest@@ ing with a black couple , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that feel the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these dre@@ ad@@ ful words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you , and those that look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ing is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we toler@@ ate , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t study his own story , he who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the wag@@ ons in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is using a giant @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ storey scenery .
the piv@@ ot@@ ation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an ab@@ out@@ dated road corner with the L@@ aying and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
prior to that , a open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhein@@ li@@ ser was pos@@ ing as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine Water@@ mers - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like already in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ess will lead them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , fo@@ ols in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a corp@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ ber@@ man Hagen which surro@@ unds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , when he k@@ ill@@ iter@@ ate Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ ductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and the hands of Merkel @-@ smokers con@@ du@@ red .
great applause exists for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in empty leisure wear .
eag@@ erly a@@ waited was the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
in 2013 , he had still had a rolling stock on a rolling stock , gave it five years later , in which the abandoned &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were under@@ gone .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding for its view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max number works as volunteers
they work at several locations in their volunteers .
where to everywhere ?
crowd : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture shop , once in the week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked in the open full day at school .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have made an SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineering course , we say , successfully canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognize for myself that it is the wrong thing and I want to do something different for me to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point , maybe even , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start in winter semester my studies in social welfare .
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual , while volunteers have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you are doing his FS@@ J .
you can do it from home @-@ house to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon support .
for me it was just the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths , as it really runs .
different than in construction engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about getting St@@ ati@@ ken .
one has more people in front of the head , which each have a completely different story behind each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager who has been caught out of the family - you always have to enter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have reservations anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a field which gives a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
P@@ ear@@ son k@@ gs more 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British Education Group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim measures by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company was faced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the job reduction , General Director of John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already been lost in 4,000 places .
P@@ ear@@ son also announced a plan for cost reduction in May in a third cost of costs by a further 300 million pound ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was taken by the fast step toward digital learning .
the company , which in the last month expressed its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ vo@@ i attack of Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ ber
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , killed by a soldier of Nato and injured several other officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters have been viol@@ ated , shared a statement by NATO .
un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , three civilians were killed .
the bombing is the last violent man who hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked an impro@@ vised ski@@ pping approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement is said that all injured are in a stable state and be treated at the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ room killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the U.S. troops invaded the Taliban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the Prussian security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ates in Kabul in the last weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ran@@ ates Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g rule to Cl@@ ages
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to regul@@ ate the government of Obama administration , which states that the States have committed to con@@ strain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States def@@ endants the agency because of the pac@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the zone provisions - in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured to specify where cuts must be made to ti@@ fy str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental impact imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should spur economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts , however , have caused the precip@@ itation of the Democrats and reserves that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rein@@ force respir@@ atory symptoms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two contra@@ ctions , the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a joint space in the future retirement system .
in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it will take a long time until the parish community has been owned by the church , but there is no planning for planning for a private investor in the project .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors that are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres floor space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council proposes such a common room not as a meeting point only for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the community .
as an example , the word of &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; sounded the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is made by the provision of funding for the current budget in the last fall , by grants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the furnishings of a joint space would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ j@@ ades &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with 60 per cent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision sees to signal the investor in this regard that you don &apos;t want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs in this regard - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as punch height reduces and the construction of economic power - which would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ous it happens to the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t get ahead with that , but in the common room they say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not make me hard with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden payout of goods or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not that way , because with the purchase of the space you don &apos;t give a supplement but get a real , in doubt , the counter @-@ market value is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to fold the decision accordingly , there are three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision , we make a giant leap forward to close a gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is lighted on the road
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cyclist was caught on Wednesday at Gar@@ ath by a car and had seriously injured .
as the police divided , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder company was on the way around 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the bike trail of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road@@ way at the altitude of the road on Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
one in the same direction driving passenger car leader granted him prim@@ acy .
when the Langen@@ feld was driving down to the road , he obviously did not lease on the traffic .
he joined a car together with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old help .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injury and was taken into a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ gn@@ ant .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in with the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with staff , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory season of the new season to Dortmund .
seven pros are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger .
staff at the German football record Master Bayern Munich are always bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must not aband@@ on David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with the Bv@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not good at last . &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in the first official bre@@ aches of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have a lot of trust that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , a very difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football counter@@ weights have the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
to hike in the Har@@ z of Star
in the resin , the first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ path &quot; is supposed to emerge .
this is the plan of the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is an Planet@@ en@@ weg in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come towards the need of many resin visitors , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they include nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic power .
members want to set up along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well achieved installation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning to achieve five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quire , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber would come .
information on the tablets are to be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later , the train path is to be expanded by train .
&quot; at the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad the viewer experienced a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the club .
they also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although he is much further away .
medi@@ ately I will find a selected star in which constellation can be seen and when it &apos;s best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the district town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located north of Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Har@@ z national park is one of the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 , there is something similar to the Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative , similar to the planned star section - the Planet@@ arium .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet@@ arium with its panels up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Equ@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the panels with the individual planet - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ inks as a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters away .
the distance from the planet is four kilometres .
while the light is required from sun to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need an hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are quicker than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to set the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ set World Boxing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down to the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Club Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it that you are champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00 on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect mag@@ n@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Garcia Garcia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bron@@ zes &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand this .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate question asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , a part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight in this year to make a date with Garcia in the next summer with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the fight against the winners of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight title campaign in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ by @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pushed himself openly to fight off the network that offers the best financing package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a giant fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he will possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he will see the battle champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Garcia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they might feel the momentum , which built himself for their own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ters
four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira driver at 16.@@ 30 in front of the connecting station , probably after a tyre plat@@ zer the control of his vehicle .
the passenger cars bound to the right into the re@@ ten@@ se , where he sur@@ passed and then remained on the roof in the gr@@ ind@@ le .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of injured by the ambul@@ ance service A7 was blocked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane bor@@ ro@@ ls over the accident at the accident .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; spin chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er against Braunschweig , that the optim@@ isation of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points takes place .
with the first season of the season was Andre Hoffmann too , with the result too , there would not be the two opponents at 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two enemies too much , and we have to adjust even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defending champion of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the Dre@@ ams chain should also be further optim@@ ised .
and a gate after a break the continued will no longer want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that there is no more to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also gets better after the experience in preparation with the rotating chain than with the quad@@ rup@@ tive chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is aware of his thing , &quot; because we just have in the spin chain on half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Fo@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , but that we do not harmon@@ ise better and we cannot afford so many errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is running to Au@@ e , to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak for a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can focus on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy we will certainly be able to speak from a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about this .
&quot; the start of the season I was only after six to eight days of playing , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken up pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann to think that players from Au@@ e might even be anything more fresh since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for asc@@ ending favor@@ ites into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner Defense of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we throw it away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is bull@@ shit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat to Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the out@@ set , &quot; Fort@@ unas Chief coach explains .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
recent results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who under@@ went a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rid@@ ts@@ ha@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with carrying out tests last year .
during the asylum seek@@ ers , they are supposed to take more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ational verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ized for errors when assess@@ ing the correct age of some refugees .
until today , migration rates have been sent to 6.@@ 880 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency used that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , results in recent months are permanent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the underground person was 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results , she discovered that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age evaluation , when X @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ tests and MRI shots of knee @-@ joints are done , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has been critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were so@@ oner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Metro Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child is un@@ ri@@ ghtly judged to judge a child .
the biggest risk is if the person is barely below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete portion on the bridge was installed at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in time , it goes super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Transport and Transport in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , work began at all three refurb@@ ishments , between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it is now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and transport safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurb@@ ished .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the city entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ ck@@ enk@@ appe .
this is an edge fixing , which is also used as an operating mode .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge board should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will go .
the special thing is that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented stock caps .
a particular finger @-@ feeling has the laying of lines through the construction works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
since there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the construction of the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is quickly regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge is closed at the height of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three frac@@ tures amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ abo@@ unding with German potato salad
it is not so often suggested that parties draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to put under a hat .
the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows that day peac@@ efully that the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites you to the poster &quot; Great Choice Competition . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are at the beginning of the event before the event , don &apos;t want to hear the AF@@ D leaders , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the town was originally planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fountain site , but there is now on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , sincere : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ancient potato sal@@ at , which also could eat the AF@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has led many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein . it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ ero is reported by the AF@@ D volcano erup@@ ted , he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already constructed Laur@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes are not available enough parking .
so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ ero is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ ar area he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , the main thing , it stays peac@@ efully . &quot;
it also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ ar site provides a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ einf@@ o @-@ ch@@ äl@@ z@@ ic AF@@ D chair@@ person Uwe Young .
there are about 200 listen@@ ers in the hall that are waiting for the leaders of the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence remains unchanged , but the officials had a peaceful evening so far .
the AF@@ D event takes a bit more than an hour the AF@@ D event takes a longer breath , but also there is a short stay there after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press back - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a re @-@ listening with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , around 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and made sol@@ op@@ positions in European leaders .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the well @-@ known Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a sol@@ oist orchest@@ ral of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the lust , not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach on the two like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik , &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz ech@@ op@@ tics Prize N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classics , jazz and the free playing to an intri@@ gu@@ ing total artwork .
this part of the program was first performed with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acou@@ st@@ ics is consci@@ ously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart very openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; when I teach cheese in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the most famous &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all assured the brunette performer opposite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very lucky in love which I took . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten gave them to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always been living du@@ alism and believed seriously .
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when they prefer just like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children said I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and sh@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of yourself ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to have a certain way and upset me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me some und@@ an@@ ly , but I don &apos;t like to justify it before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a major announcement to the West Virginia rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and have inherited a co@@ operative business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather go towards us to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is un@@ true and unable to find a positive , agreed message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were ch@@ ained with competitions gold and silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was found in November 2015 , following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) to state d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were pleased that Russia has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive one day , and I think adv@@ ances have been achieved , but the Congress does not support the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
the n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athletics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , compete for the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral staff .
the leaders of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia should still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dr@@ y@@ tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited trainer are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forced labor@@ mat@@ ing in Mali
during a fun@@ eral proc@@ ession in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people have thought about the two at a helicopter landing in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
for even un@@ explained down@@ fall , Secretary of Defense Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two inver@@ ted pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rounder of her specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Chief of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total death of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at lunch , only the members of the Church had taken leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession began in the circle of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the chief inspec@@ tor of the Federal Armed Forces Volker Wie@@ ker .
sad@@ ness put on ro@@ ses , the relatives stood in arm on the hem .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense minister of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers and sat@@ ile soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief Sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built up the flight operations of the tiger helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers were part , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew could not turn off the crash , there was none of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the commitment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the federal defense did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave alongside his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be best@@ owed by his wife after his death .
it shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already had a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , he was named in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made mention of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired and ref@@ uses the title &quot; Prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik was not entitled to the title and function that he wanted to see himself not as equivalent to his wife - not after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the Leader of the Danish Royal House .
the last resting place of the 83 year old will be ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach the intention of being set up in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country , which he worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ ratic family , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the symp@@ ath@@ ie@@ ving of the people always flew away , Prince Hen@@ rik had a difficult stand in his almost 50 years of re@@ mission in the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik passed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ized .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk performances instead of kn@@ itting , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis rather than Football .
even for the Gau@@ ll@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , who in Germany had the call to be the brand @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for evidence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a new selection
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ at@@ sens Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is due to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the day , but he does not want to re@@ sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament spoke for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier , the surprised exit of a Green Party from their country fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover had lost its cr@@ unch on the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
the former Green Party El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday .
CDU &amp; D Group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group .
in this way , the CDU and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new State Parliament will be elected 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must decide whether they can go@@ vern a majority in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , keeps it indispensable to resol@@ ves the country tag as fast as its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through her further .
the state of state also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament avo@@ ids confidence and choose a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these options must be sc@@ anned legally , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; we will discuss all questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; West &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the political scientist Himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as the app@@ endant of Black @-@ Green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ref@@ usal to return their country party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that they have received their country party , which they have received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Party of Anja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided not to lead an pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the re@@ signs of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ west to the CDU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green ME@@ Ps in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Chancellor of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the Austr@@ o @-@ West exit costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past adul@@ ter@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration are her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate game and tried to beat them political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Group President Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to encourage his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CDU .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 country code .
the CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD , but the SPD and the Green Party had a very thin majority by a vote .
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
interview with the editor in Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect yourself from poison eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amped pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ di now takes over the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of clari@@ fying by the Federal Ministry of Economics is not really perceived ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the food surveillance is the state of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and is situated in Germany &apos;s close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just like the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are busy and health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the resi@@ den@@ d@@ ant content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not able to transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after the first knowledge of the production plants , production plants meet no immediate fault .
rather , they must pay economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service firms .
as always , there is too little controllers in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or also at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have uncovered the process .
the truth , however , belongs to the fact that food fraud and criminal energy could never be excluded from 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there are a consequ@@ ent explanation of such events and the delivery to the coun@@ cils in the cases where off@@ ences may be pre@@ valent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a number of information about the responsible authority I expect from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ mis@@ m really necessary on food scales ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and bu@@ oy@@ able foods .
when a non @-@ authorized insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by means of the means , manufacturers , merchants and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the position of life @-@ preserved animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must be rig@@ ged consistently and with high pressure on all levels .

how the finance rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s World Record @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA yet , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that were set up by the UEFA Cup in 2011 means that PS@@ G should point out sometime , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to get the Brazi@@ lians out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure that Ne@@ ym@@ ar sign up and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , considering the financing of the team by the rich ruling family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must conform with legitim@@ ate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked their support when banks or owners back their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , FF@@ P dropped from concentration on the clubs &apos;s debts to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea , originally purchased a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the team and build a global brand - to a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ reference period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to put away from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is in charge of the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount of the invoice for the period of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the deposit accounts for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 is the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G was received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEFA Cup is searching for clubs trying to over@@ list their financial supervision by connecting their revenue by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a Hungarian company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEFA Champions would not be considered legitim@@ ate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of PSA from the Qatar Tourism Authority was born .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments on Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be an ambassador for the UEFA regulator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA even cat@@ ching will be aware of each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory convers@@ ations with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a turnover of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association dates from that sales after the signature by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ suit by claim@@ ing that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars .
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations from La league will share a state financed by a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you have different ways or will have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in recent years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y has made Fre@@ y board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the con@@ jun@@ ctions work in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ ordering the order .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ert confirmed the report on request of the news agency S@@ DA for a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning the airline will conclude a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
products would be checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers of Chocol@@ at@@ Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small rot@@ or @-@ packed ch@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ eln packed into 14 grams a year before landing at passengers .
Swiss does not want to make any information about the costs .
in accordance with the &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; order volume , the average volume of net income increases to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , with annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more importantly , the promotional effect : for a chocolate @-@ manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
how many applicants are there at the new tender , the Swiss will not betra@@ y .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at@@ Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to rela@@ unch the treaty by spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate bars have been distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss decided to contract a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo was Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long distance trips , the customers of the first class with treats are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at@@ Fre@@ y .
even on the short stretch , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at@@ Fre@@ y distributed both in Business and Economy Class .

nost@@ al@@ gia comes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Nazi @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pre@@ emin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and a st@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as Franchise feels it , the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his sur@@ sur@@ ing Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a talking box vegetable , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by putting yourself down to the core of the g@@ ags - Ac@@ tors middle age play dirty children who grow up - still creating the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ el back .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally @-@ rooted and his par@@ ody is more like the wat@@ ering principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ year like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That S@@ cra@@ cks the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character created by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely Coo@@ p ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams of the best part of the fran@@ chise are .
it is a lot of fun to see the et@@ ern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ illons of sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ cker .
it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band as they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds one of the other types of nost@@ al@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka made a com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main trol@@ ls - a hard @-@ gro@@ wer , Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced to English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to see ( the police sp@@ ends time to check out chess on TV as Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda campaign - a killer that carries a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it is often as a single one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with six long episodes it takes place , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; who was re@@ activated on a lower length , could always be able to see his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ Sati@@ re better , because Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef is always busy the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ burger .
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a gel .

blow against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects ad@@ di@@ cted as the pro@@ secut@@ ors Konst@@ anz was divided on Friday .
between the ages of 25 and 77 years , 15 of them were arrested and already issued warran@@ ts against this .
civil servants also issued large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
German arrest warran@@ ts German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
members of the Mafia is organised by drug criminal , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the Pro@@ secution &apos;s Office provides const@@ ancy against organised traff@@ icking in southern Germany .
between the Heads of State in Constance and Palermo a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the grand use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
the exam@@ ining of the exam@@ inations were all the Italian nationals with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ started , where several shots were fired in a restaurant in early morning , should go to the gang of the gang .
ways be@@ ating big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner regi@@ sters in Germany has significant flaws in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious failure in asylum procedures .
the representative for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the extension of the country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies in the pre @-@ registered data could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are covered with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts has not been well maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become a German citizen and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input allows revers@@ ing to slow down processes , &quot; it means further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics of foreign nationals must be covered by EU citizens who would not have had to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mis@@ ordin@@ ations led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dis@@ astro@@ us debate about dealing with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subject &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy when they travelled from there .
it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
according to the paper , the BAM@@ F calls such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the paper exam@@ ines the difficult situation locally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees in the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ ré continues to travel into another EU country , this state may send him back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy have increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy worked for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) are sufficient for this promise .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threat@@ ening un@@ lawful mit@@ ig@@ ation conditions and a endang@@ ering of child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood living in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach was already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
at present , Jürgen Gre@@ ule is headed by Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile gave 100 litres of blood in the meantime .
traditionally , the congregation den@@ ces in the session of the council to don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is genius how our body is created and we quote the don@@ ors respect that their blood will be available for foreigners , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lining Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood sp@@ ying helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the convey@@ ing ladder of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are disper@@ sed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ or .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions taken in the spring of Ober@@ reich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ vas@@ cular committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before the previous year , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Schö@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Meta Ren@@ e@@ berry were awarded to the multiple sclerosis and were awarded for 50 years of blood donations .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Rie@@ x@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter will have 500 milli@@ liters of their lives .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates by 0,@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation would have resist@@ ed spec@@ ulation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain in keeping with interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members an increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue to continue to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but she sign@@ alizes that in the next few years of interest rates would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit and they said that credit charges could rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected now that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system , with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deci@@ ding on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the Gross Dom@@ estic Product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure restri@@ cts the consumption of the households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain impact of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; gradually &quot; would be limited .
the Bank forecast down@@ wards corrected by the Bank for this and next year is 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages from the dollar and the Euro .
the pound was dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.@@ 11 .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have d@@ amped the rising expectations and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the bank will recover slightly by the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and minor pay@@ outs , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation will be even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages rose to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of its three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , resulting in lower consumption expend@@ itu@@ res .
the decision comes one year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fung@@ us .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and economy .
prior to the last verdict of the Bank to interest rates , the call upon a rate of interest rates increased , because inflation increased pressure to hard , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation rose from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , while the bank said that this was expected to attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the ri@@ ots in relation to their goal of 2 % may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the len@@ ders would want to search for shops and want to finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those with which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall promote controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive medicine from September after a fight against the financing of the medication in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS UK announced that a pre @-@ risk pre@@ positi@@ vity ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk provisions by around 86 percent , now is estimated by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for valued 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the last year , according to the N@@ HS , in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday , Simon Stev@@ ens was welcomed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will be introduced in October 2018 before it will be throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ positi@@ vity phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that the EC@@ EP reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious substances .
pre@@ h@@ EP prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or even two hours before the intercourse .
for those who come in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners , who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered at a domestic physician may also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is offered £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of a pre@@ EP by evalu@@ ating clinical evidence , as it is used specifically , absorbed and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This big new intervention should complement and over@@ take the increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , when targeted and endangered people are targeted , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ m@@ ics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September onwards , people will have high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to truly control a new instrument and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to lie on the whole country and that no one who has a risk for HIV are left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP testing medicine has been pro@@ mul@@ gated , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , a shadow of health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ on@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due for months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence shows how transform this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the termination of the dis@@ semin@@ ation of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and smart designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed her bags and sells her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne Stau@@ raum and a mezz@@ anine add to the generous ceiling height optimal use .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use a 12.5 feet high ceilings , which was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel movement is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange rooms so that they were st@@ acked over each other , without that we had to decorate with g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ ur@@ vi@@ us looks down through the glam@@ orous areas .
red wooden furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting use the style for the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous noise , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a tax door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the fan of steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important that if you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room Jo@@ anne able to gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here , they managed to enlarge the soil area and use high @-@ quality materials that provide space with its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and they are therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electric outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased levels of square from somewhat def@@ aul@@ ted into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave them .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar imperi@@ ums
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ alists Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how its property and its business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to retreat from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city area , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with her late father , Colin - by Paul is described as &quot; main operator and domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one third .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court case says that Colin property has a value of € 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those of Colin proposed ratings have left him with what I stayed for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday .
the brothers are now fighting over the existing business , as Colin says , as Paul claims to be excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true but he throws Paul before , to manage some of their poss@@ essions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an early monkey , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held ac@@ credit@@ ation .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy and del@@ icacy stores in the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ venti@@ es .
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the family in Colin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he began West co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of De Lut@@ is Group group , with Colin says that Mark was paid at the leaving of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain and move to our family name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me in our current dispute , &quot; he said , and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ ump of new staff of staff plans to restri@@ ct the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss in a more uniform course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met in his first day of work with executive employee , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information , which fall into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or on let@@ tering - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagn@@ osis makes sense , but others have tried to count tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing its media dict@@ at@@ ment .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relation to television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV show is still strong .
&quot; when Can@@ didate was upset because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps Twitter habit ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was under control &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps they know something that we don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know - that m@@ umps twe@@ ets could have even more com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff had made him away a few times , anno@@ y@@ ance with him , then their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently preventing it , that tr@@ ump controversi@@ es is created .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , who are composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump Material , which may be promoting their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to sur@@ ate the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press reports , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he sti@@ ff@@ ened to find out where they come from .
that was exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody called the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the site of the internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a pile to be &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson has been ban@@ ished for ch@@ ic@@ ans permanent from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he claims the wrong accus@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask for employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and to document the ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive selves , and his advis@@ ers always strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Master wanted crimin@@ als get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped .
the police are sent throughout Europe during this summer ( virtual ) postcards of dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the searched heavy @-@ break@@ ers are not known , critics from the population will be hoping and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christmas calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown many fle@@ eting out of holiday dest@@ in@@ ations , it was called Europ@@ ol .
I have compiled 21 postcards to selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ell , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the Online watches have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them based on publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of West Mid@@ lands will again be negoti@@ ated with some of the trav@@ ellers on a war foot@@ ed , which have taken out one of the church in front of their houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies , and a army of tran@@ sports , after they had dropped out in May without being deported from the excav@@ ated tren@@ ch to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the overclo@@ cking group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were moved on Monday evening after they were sent away by Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by switching to the implementation in fact , because he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passengers were there in May , moved and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it , holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am living on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to pay for my community costs , if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents support an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we place our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts &apos; gates is being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the former ambi@@ ence of company gesellschaft mbH , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year passed and proceeds from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , the number of refugees came to the district in the district , offered dramatically as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not disp@@ uted in the municipal council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ bürger@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke already then of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
welcome to Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing in front of the entrance to the entrance , and when you enter the house , the vast renovation work will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to part degra@@ ded , old bath@@ rob@@ es from the rooms are removed .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; nice &quot; later , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it is not necessary to move at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher centre level , st@@ resses Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are well equipped , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual tourists , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the visions of the city are equal with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not planning to define exactly .
he reck@@ ons under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior facilities are also brought on front of the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace that is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Jury uses Grand Jury
in the Russia affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have invited a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
the committee recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal with the case confi@@ ded people .
the paper exam@@ ines the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the CNN broad@@ c@@ aster CNN reported that there was already first inv@@ itations of the atro@@ cities associated with a meeting between Tr@@ umps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ uses the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer , to be targeted specifically in the 2016 Presi@@ dential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were agreements between tr@@ umps or Con@@ vic@@ tors and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to act as advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ ich Tr@@ ump picked up himself into the centre and I am looking for a proposal if the president might hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check and decide the evidence in possible breaks and decide whether the charges should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Prosecutor .
usually , they are switched on if it is bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Pro@@ secution to un@@ loading persons under o@@ ath .
according to the CNN Sender CNN , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were exhibited already around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps served as advisor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam assistant director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the en@@ forcement show that Mu@@ eller should not inti@@ mi@@ date in his work and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president of Thursday held a speech in West Virginia in order to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats a way of feeling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know anything from the integration of a Grand Jury .
however , they usually work in the secret , he empha@@ sized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House prof@@ ites all measures that have accelerated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was called in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this root , accus@@ ations were viol@@ ated against Tr@@ ump , he didn &apos;t want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a position of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under enormous pressure due to the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is dis@@ car@@ ded .
unlike in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , such as Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller is a position in which he could be fired on behalf of the President of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent one such step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators subsequently issued bills on Thursday , after which the Sonder@@ eller could no longer be dismissed .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the Western Antarc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved from the scar@@ ring of almost seven @-@ fold @-@ fold of Berlin .
this gave the Bremer@@ haven @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the region &apos;s over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres lead to the north and will probably take two , three years until he was melted .
with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest Ice giant , the researchers have registered for the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the termination of the ice@@ berg , according to researchers , is un@@ clear .
however , there have been a series of unusual co@@ asts of ice cream in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
in the opinion of many researchers , this could be related to global warming .

there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front edge of the edge have never gone back as far as now .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and can be crushed if a piece is left at a key point .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ur@@ ges so much water as it gives to the mel@@ ts itself .
however , loss of failure causes the glacier to the sea directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only very small , writes the British research project for the Ob@@ servation of Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tic after A@@ WI with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and is aware of no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the start of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists was argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will return to grow or go back over the long term , and perhaps sum@@ med up his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers do not cause this huge ice@@ berg to decline in climate change , so many c@@ ud@@ dly of the Ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ ischen Peninsula can be dis@@ infected in the past few decades .
this long summit of Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase was decreased .
the Ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ ian Peninsula have war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and is counting in the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU out of pets in the staff
as it is increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CDU , to leave the Labour Association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the chal@@ k had to gain 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees work for the gover@@ ning administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have stood behind their first working day .
the courses at the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
there were about 620 applicants for this year to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing , in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are several places in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann after 50 years ago .
among other things , physi@@ cians and engineers are sought as well as forces of the general administration .
the CDU still wants to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG jointly and to the administration of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel production and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to un@@ cover only short @-@ term conditions of skilled workers , but future @-@ proof of applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , take concrete measures for cross entry and an educ@@ ate offensive , call CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems you previously did not know .
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees , the disease or age , comes from the service .
so the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint proposal with his party .
he was already tra@@ cked in the cra@@ yon for a f@@ ain@@ less surprise when he publicly dis@@ covering the personnel charges and stun@@ ned by the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want to check that all possibilities will be checked out of the communist employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not able to come to a satisfactory solution here , the district administration with unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - will strive for a household tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by doing so , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to better pay for public service except for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently required accurately , enh@@ ancements or more money is only when one changes in a higher level , which are oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew over in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be established , in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prost@@ itute .
not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy po@@ res the tone to NGO &apos;s ambul@@ ance @-@ bo@@ oting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; Youth R@@ ained &quot; because their crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with traff@@ ickers in a way which em@@ itted illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , declined to express itself about exec@@ uting the Italian State Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are really sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can all invo@@ ices which are currently raised , first of which we collected all information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; youth R@@ uta &apos; , who supervised the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that its crew can board ding@@ h@@ y migrants who are directly delivered directly from human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one such meeting took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the State of State , whose contents of Italian media have been published .
the occupation is suspected of susp@@ ecting the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue routes in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue approaches have now been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules as unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not take any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign himself is the Nobel Prize for doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti said now that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , has declined in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried out the collaboration with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine W@@ eil@@ mer Biker , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and land@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three be@@ fri@@ ended guides stood at this disposal .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed sight points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and those in @-@ bearing planes .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went home to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ ages market .
again attracted to the look@@ out spot , bound by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days many meters of altitude were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and inc@@ lines brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker made the ho@@ ker in the open @-@ air healing Sole .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best site - spor@@ adic and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga hits E @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in the future before computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating with wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been to a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
this is also recognized by the first federal lig@@ ator , which are increasingly involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and adopted two professionals for the FIFA World game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire the new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; there are many clubs on this move . &quot;
at the upcoming weekend FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; which matches the Gam@@ er of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people still walk into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting , all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with promin@@ ently E @-@ athletes under contract , one might be more often present on these markets than once in the year the Federal lig@@ ament to Asia .
what is it about ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or is the FIFA soccer @-@ simulation FIFA at compet@@ itor level .
long , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games by 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport for itself ?
for many , the performance is safe to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ y also has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive skills require a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console but also exercise their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
controls are heavy through online games , and in the scene , the structures of the classic Sports are missing .
researchers empha@@ sizes the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the road , which is like a great global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) is predic@@ ting its rapid growth .
in 2016 , it was estimated to have been 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments .
sales at 130 million are reported in three years .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga , this is a little .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from among other established sports such as Hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
internationally , many countries are already far@@ ther .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball h@@ unters Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and in France the S@@ utt &apos;s football @-@ first clubs are obliged to establish an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
exp@@ ire only in nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is not enough anymore .
it is about to preserve tradition of the association , but the company will be directed to the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can &apos;t hold on it , that only in football everything remains the same as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter found suicide because of his lyrics to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encour@@ ages her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentence behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to life in June for a neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free of appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her lawyer did argue that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood out with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the At@@ tor@@ ney at the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has not taken responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no pen@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible fact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not show that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day in which I didn &apos;t stress the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want he to be proud of me and how I &apos;m going with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will bear with us for eternity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she will never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or his aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person having been together since my birth , a pain which I will always keep for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call for another crime committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon dioxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case with@@ drew national attention , after Car@@ ters text messages reli@@ eved him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g thyself , spring of a building , cat@@ walk yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent out in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything you have to do is to place the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case has shared legal opinion .
the few who defended Carter , belonged to Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 because of murder on her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before they were acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup as captain is not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ams the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation does not harm .
something was different at his place in the cabin , and Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich looked immediately , even if the additional garment was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and not Manuel Neuer has to be seen , he made him a shut down to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the level could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also point to something like that .
not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was in the youth gam@@ ers , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the vacation of commented professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f has been chosen as toys , but he .
sugar is distributed to those who want to pay much for those who want to keep in mood .
if you are chosen to enter the L@@ ah@@ m heritage , a small extra motivation can only use well .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was the mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m above the field .
on the right side , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich has worked on this n@@ formation , like the one who can also take the ru@@ d@@ der into the hands .
he gave instructions , tried to direct un@@ broken tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy .
V@@ idal thus unable to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , to devil , come out to the services of Asia &apos;s journey ( folding also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nikl@@ as Sü@@ le thus failed to fall down in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both were sovereign .
the well occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and Sü@@ ver also tried to build a couple of times in playing @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not so , as we have hoped it would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed an extraordinary performance in his debut .
playing shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot;
as usual this Bayern world is still waiting for the re@@ course , one saw the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on the back of his new players .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I have noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you simply have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not need to teach the new one .

company happy with rh@@ einf@@ o @-@ pf@@ ile Minister : Economics engaged Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of State of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was .
this is reflected in more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T @-@ V demand from a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ fish at the same time the old ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the biggest turn of the turn sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the connection of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now .
this year the Ministry of Planning is hoping for the construction right to be set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West @-@ he@@ el Trier , which is in the advance required of the Federal Court of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to take the track in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ speaking Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees there a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier stri@@ ves to increase the sales of a Rheinland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase the sales of supermarkets in supermarkets and the trend of the German exports of German exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing also has an open ear for people who want to establish a company &apos;s own company , the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
planned is a premium of 1000 Euro for the In@@ gre@@ ed Master Review and 2500 Euro if graduates live independently within ten years after the master@@ class .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
during the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time it commands the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers that don &apos;t want to adjust Wis@@ sing at the national business , so far 29 places are occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more jobs to be awarded by external offices .
the CDU faction of Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country will invest more than 20 million euros in 2017 and in the receipt of national roads in 2017 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to remedy the trade hole in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the old broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the supply of power supplies in an I@@ HK survey only 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing internet connection and breaks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies again .
Audi is going to change 8@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers faced with a counter @-@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options as a limited restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as recall .
European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxide , em@@ itting the diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles , also to install what it is difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful auto@@ fir@@ ming and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation units , to adjust emissions when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics were arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations , after the authorities have installed Audi to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could find Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer exceeds proportional to the Volkswagen win .

Mor@@ am@@ us@@ el@@ essly Kn@@ oll@@ ens and the laughter of suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was part of the best @-@ published cartoon animation , the rab@@ bits of his characters are its trademark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is still working and working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he himself drew himself as a sign for greetings cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he became a breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the publication of its cart@@ oons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
for even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
the artists of the city were inspired again .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures , in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , his own data still sits on the drau@@ ght , works daily for almost ten hours a day .
over calendars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches find their dro@@ ll figures still plenty of distribution worldwide .
he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - mor@@ ill@@ less favourite animal in his drawings - which has a mill@@ ennium as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore , he rather sets out onto the TV series , which is produced by his original drawings .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lav@@ ender is due to re@@ mind@@ ing the conditions and due to the diseases of excessive insects , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , big head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence has been effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change that has brought much less rain in spring and in the fall much more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades transfers , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil does not only delight for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very much appreciated for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered should be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 th anniversary .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : you should take their children into the office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or let them go home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ale , Al@@ lies .
they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the obe@@ dience list of the government or the Cart@@ elle , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos dangerous .
there are no rest in the violence , and while in the whole country the bodies were frequent , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to did his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are made for attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter her editors and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , Co @-@ founder , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deep experienced , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , that is showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discussing their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a Pro@@ der Office has been established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , this has led only two criminal proceedings to the Committee to protect journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year with drug traff@@ icking and organized crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ separ@@ able , although the terrain is even more tra@@ verse .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , we are suspic@@ ious of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s capital .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is virtually nothing about silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos; arrest in January and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lements of the country , because rival fac@@ tions were strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ench@@ anted , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug , larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was for@@ cing that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival fac@@ tual fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , we suspected of each copy of the issue as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to do so , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues could ann@@ im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to have journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the revenues and advertising grew .
reporter loved to publish hard tre@@ aties without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else would be dealing with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Preis &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drugs history , wherever it was .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do with so many sco@@ oter ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce Team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
it confi@@ ded on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there is always sitting at the same table .
now ask her : was his love for routine to be a routine ?
his death also forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you &apos;re dealing with their wives , their children , their proper shops , their home starting and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ giving .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative tra@@ ders , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the cow@@ o@@ ce staff met for security training , no cell phones were allowed . days earlier has been known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
half in j@@ est , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor themselves as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the reporter has gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs were de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has kn@@ itted on three major stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ er Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expend@@ itu@@ res which concentrated on the home town of the govern@@ ance .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the lawyer , led a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it was so , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally by drug traff@@ ickers and authorities .
a rep@@ orters learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who was registered by the gover@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) which dominated the entire century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ cali@@ b@@ ated cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this place , among them one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went on a military case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez could have been viewed as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , all channels of communication are broken up with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ickers that are protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ or@@ ic Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ te a few characters and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the lawyer .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become stronger throughout the country by bringing them down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on content and building sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to ex@@ ert journalists and kill them , because they have said the truth .
she has been asked to have asked that she is again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes committed to the government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valid society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters could not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who are using organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the media group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; reported more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one eats the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was report@@ edly signed by the Z@@ eta cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am with my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua as the murder of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how it did El man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug cart@@ el with a Editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their home countries , or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to have been murdered by the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to the drug traff@@ icking is fri@@ ghtened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and I became rep@@ orters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , as suddenly all their teleph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a series of arbit@@ ration with rib@@ bed v@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan camp had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the br@@ ink edge , they have published the news on the Ri@@ o@@ ce website on the mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who were guard to see if they were in will@@ ingness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen green founder of the newspaper , whose mid @-@ finger was visible to quite s@@ alo@@ a , the cow@@ o@@ ce staff pursued his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can also remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day , on the Javier was murdered , the intern was asked me to send them to the reporting on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to eradi@@ cate his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ ghtening .
now researchers have found out that the first evidence of incredible Nash@@ ville have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa in the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his schu@@ pp@@ le skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ar@@ mo@@ red Dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably good condition demonstrated researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; stun@@ ned .
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of what seemed to take away from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more closely .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expos@@ e the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all these hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blind@@ ly blind@@ ly , you could almost believe that it has slept &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa in the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , even though he is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide from prey , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technology used as counter@@ attack which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix up better in its surroundings and to eradi@@ cate his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ Techni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours with it .
the amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sha@@ ding , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their bottom .
although the console is custom@@ ary , the results are unexpected because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs have driven enough pressure on the end @-@ end din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution of confron@@ tation as a means of survival benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ tours , think about deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents have been to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r bay was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including the fourth Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ f@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank to the sea ground .
at that time , Alberta has been as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal reserves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal almost looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ design it . if you just play a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal cycles , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the researchers , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the immort@@ al din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
on average , the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long @-@ long tops operated by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous plant was flooded by the western Canada , until an floo@@ ding river flooded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ er of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin &apos;s most still b@@ ump@@ y tank plates are covered along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is such &quot; rare as winning .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remainder of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels which carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are divided up .
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age to the A8 : many injured
he@@ fty accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long st@@ ems and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age of about 20 people were injured .
after the first data of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the bays of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis der A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a storm almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , were probably also trucks .
over the exact number of injured changes , no data was first published .
it is light until moderate injury , said a police pre@@ cher .
a great array of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich a ten @-@ kilometer long retreat was formed .
like a AZ reporter , there came also on the counter @-@ track to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ices the plates of the vehicle manufacturers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident oc@@ cured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ olls .
this was a coll@@ ision between a car engine and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is clu@@ stered at the train and sleeps .
or you have been deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes an impro@@ per or ri@@ pping the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket Control .
but the times of breaks are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the consumer @-@ free ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that one is taken up and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does the offer come from , we make it off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available for many more distant destinations in Germany in the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the train the ticket stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what will most passengers do anyway .
you have to buy it through the app by rail , DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient kind of ticket booking .
and at last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one goes into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button to unlock the electronic release .
the train@@ ers get a message on their mobile devices that chassis X is located in the train and took the booked seat Y .
when the train esc@@ ort comes at S@@ Y checking , he knows that a passenger is already sitting on the online ticket .
so you can keep up , keep further , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who relaxed without ticket control by our train companion , check out the DB Navigator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time a train personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB remote traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
second plus : &quot; our employees have more time than today to go into individual customer needs . &quot;
who frequently drives train , know that in addition to delays or pas@@ sively trains the ticket checks are among the greatest nu@@ ances .
because often you do not have any documents in any case , but one of the co @-@ travelers will not include all documents you need for the dev@@ alu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is missing , or a document that has to be presented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between the train esc@@ ort and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner will take the time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
as a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Prayer was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ers on their phone .
she stum@@ bled on a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody had posted the information posted on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ arded on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis had been killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns empty body , stretched out on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; he thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman took his ri@@ f@@ le and shou@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder that we have grown acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the following day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took over her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival , love and loss , strength and resistance force that exists from the point of view of people living in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when fer@@ ring with her daughter , wearing a flower g@@ own and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had a lot of times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ minded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and it will see and put up in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even though I &apos;ve been lucky to give you an experience in which they had no ec@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would give it a bad service to hold them far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police agency that was waiting for a camp@@ ground when the activists on the possible non @-@ charge officer of Dar@@ ren Wilson was waiting .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local company owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass on protest@@ ers .
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m was totally changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , notice her as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you document or tries to find a story you can benefit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance to their resi@@ li@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and we didn &apos;t want to centr@@ ate their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ in@@ kt .
his commitment brought fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are displayed , for so I will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rel@@ ling lives , as she fell in love and married her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the human being of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , Fer@@ rel@@ ls took the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which have influenced the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2012 in social media , identi@@ fying himself as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the bulk of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is insist@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ated type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who shook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a co@@ incidence , although it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is standing so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has now disappeared , but the rac@@ ist links between the community and the police are still standing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she kl@@ es herself to a singing and she feels obliged to mind that she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discuss a bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has out@@ dated the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold the subject makes hardly any cold .
the topic is also discussed in our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one for the bit gallery will say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ets ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; range w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates building that a gallery of more customers is moving into the city , the other businesses also benefit , fear the enemies that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
additionally : the gallery is planned just on the property , on which the farmers market hall is , in which 13 companies offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work , the end will be concluded .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm still very happy .
the but@@ cher too was discovered for us too .
we would wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to sust@@ ain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if director market in a market hall in the gallery , get to the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; what is the most shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , footwear , dr@@ ink@@ - or supermarkets : I think that is unnecessary .
there is enough in our city enough .
you see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
however , since there is not even a good weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains .
because after all , the product offered there is fresh , most of them are offered directly from the producer .
as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall just by bigger companies , because the mi@@ ds are often not portable for a retailers .
too bad , special stores are almost no more and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not match Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market launch during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration , if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the ghost @-@ bit gallery before selling all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs no one .
according to my view , it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but for a farm hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , that almost un@@ differenti@@ ate the cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ tu@@ bing and hair@@ cuts , which you were sent to us by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ st made a sentence of 35 years of imprisonment after she publicly contained diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has turned their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ mis@@ sive dis@@ sident , when he had turned into office only three days .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as someone who can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ing of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been talking about the identification than a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty was convicted of 20 charges , including six bre@@ aches against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a driver seat and a plat@@ inum blonde perfor@@ ig is - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strange art@@ e@@ facts like cigarette st@@ ills and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she could not take pictures , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use were trained to un@@ equal letters that were out of several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ er Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who would fore@@ see a future in which the President Chel@@ y@@ ish deliber@@ ate judgement and could be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would call for the release of seven brutal years in a Kansas jail term , was a welcome kind of happy co@@ incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump will take a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find the rigid divisions that he should actually solve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for the artistic statement below , called &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation which have been the foundation of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly @-@ developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it , is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is a page of the Comic @-@ Nov@@ els .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she shows with a free ef@@ on in hand in hand out of the discipl@@ ines of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they put in cold notes , they have won , &quot; it says .
&quot; thus never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps , when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the middle of the room from the masks which combine themselves as hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was also aimed at how everything works in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) when the genetic hap@@ lo@@ aders were written with a pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that joins Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide man @-@ hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who had been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , the acts of the Local Court of Cook .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed away after several styles .
a warning system published by the Chicago police authorities say that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared at the place of the happening for dead , and investig@@ ators examine the bul@@ che as a murder while police are looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officers .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now buried in ur@@ lau@@ ght and excluded from the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue , being investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ators in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want to be found .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ect to oppos@@ e the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who just had an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that had just happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration on the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible home proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment of the criteria , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test the UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable is updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
commenting on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to ad@@ here to the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ entry of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and published recently on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could give concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Auth@@ orities has publicly supported the reported results of the d@@ WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in public @-@ supported state d@@ oping in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct an investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we won &apos;t admit that what exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has controversial locations and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ as from the WA@@ DA from conducting d@@ oping controls in Russia .
it was however allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the Start @-@ ups which will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy deliver@@ er wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t trust the trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Savi@@ our who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside .
a new race of human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing , in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , they allow businesses to offer surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers let them deal with the C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tool is used to measure employees .
salvation said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a high heat map of the company that have a look at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low interest results - so that you can drill below , why .
companies come to look at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not have the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who describes a blog post where those who have spoken to be punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 according to the financial scientific website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid@@ st the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies lets you tail@@ or @-@ tailored &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can report bad behavior .
and if the chief business leaders are involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion cap@@ tures regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his employees is badly treated or imp@@ acting , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , workers fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has set Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
so@@ oner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , form@@ ulated a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ts convertible , problems that were previously sitting by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair pract@@ ition@@ ers , are identified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment policies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed for ethical violations of the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soci@@ alistic media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies knew you couldn &apos;t stop that their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both have supported start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and carried out its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts .
the staff want to feel that you are accept@@ ing and appreciated your time with a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worth it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can achieve profit when their portfolio company run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the Analytics tools promise third promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on staff commitment according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator &apos;s administ@@ rators cannot take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you need to be willing to have 4.000 convers@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company which has to rely on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to lead action on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights into the staff , and it hopes for a long term that leads to a better relationship of workers in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers will talk on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team this unusual minutes is a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returning to their final exam , before they return at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Water Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real trekking mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedule of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , where the brood at the beginning of the camp is postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . prior to the start of the formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the control change of N@@ CAA support even if they add a further point to the player &apos;s many busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have simply performed it , they plac@@ ken themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due in the clear view of its fields marked by an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been fitted with foot@@ ball@@ ers , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ step .
brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a cleared out that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people will hire a room there and set up there to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ feit detection by third parties and their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on its website , that it will begin using the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible counter@@ feit detection and send them to fac@@ tions check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the key points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with false stories over the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to be punished by social media networks , if they do not succeed in order to remove h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook was speaking in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts will be started .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tions are cont@@ oured by third parties , people want more context to understand what they read and share &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feeds to reduce incorrect messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a swal@@ low for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of its cozy residence in the wat@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a Mu@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans time from the Middle Ages to the age by Edward and documented the families that were living in Scot@@ ia . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac swi@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection published by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ party in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and letters were always sm@@ iled to smoke , for at that time a fire was lit because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as he himself would be .
Oh , I love Archives ! &quot;
for anyone who is so using old papers , is that he was assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest : I enjoyed my welcome drink a little exceeded &quot; ) it seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , as about the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he immig@@ rated across the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape designer , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , which suggest that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought two families .
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take on a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who re@@ signs the newly built castle to join the farmers of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a ri@@ ots that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &quot; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peas@@ ant started in this territory and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , depicted in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , staged its own fun@@ eral , when he filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was taken only years later , when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite dangerous , always making debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men dissolved their debt cr@@ ates by giving them rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scre@@ am experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ ben@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ itation from the early 20th century , which has been rec@@ alled by nature .
but Scot@@ ia has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ anne in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ juana in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto NEU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep his logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there should be a cul@@ mination of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) not really &quot; write on its yesterday accessible website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make sure that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly belief that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in action , it is more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and slogan , it &apos;s called on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one which gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other mun@@ icipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f is raising its new roof brand and the campaign will cost a total five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
each year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es over Pen@@ sion@@ ists and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is how this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with Turkish armed forces a year after coup attempt .
the meeting was held no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the Government , the five Vice @-@ President , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs , participated in the advis@@ ors .
thus , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the majority .
the government with@@ draws the re@@ ins in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were lowered .
since the failed coup , President Erdoğan fired 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdogan as a dra@@ ch@@ ment of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly to the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the crash test as a &quot; gift &quot; because he had the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army under control ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfort in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army that manifest@@ ed among others in the repe@@ al of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand cle@@ ans in the army and the security forces continue to work in any case .
in mid @-@ July Erdogan sent more 73@@ 95 state services , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
in doing so , when Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the real gentle@@ men of the country .
three times , they put@@ t their role as a watch@@ man of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdogan as targeted as a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a well @-@ named officer , who searched for asylum in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , there is no doubt in the alliance to the pur@@ ification of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managers and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , str@@ ingent regulations for the creation of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and will do billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will change it by giving the citizens from other countries &apos; Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the funding to support themselves and show knowledge of our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry plans to renov@@ ate route for race airport
over the past few months the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ o@@ des distance , on which the tourist bus drives , will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les on the long @-@ term , according to the transport of the transport ministry , construction work will start in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and refurb@@ ish the Ilmenau race track , the country is particularly important for the tourism important link , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route continued to approx . 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the land is 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be reconc@@ iled , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry and the South of Thur@@ ing@@ ia as operators are already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the timetable that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this enables the race to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the racing platform is an especially popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Renn@@ weg railway stations .
in recent months , the course of a pilot plant was tested , whether the distance of sufficient people is used to order them regularly in the future .
in addition , the circuit is di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of Sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not be missed in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of Sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ ky , Emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take up their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the paint color of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies provide a lot of it and we &apos;ll see them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ ky upon publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ pers have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon scal@@ p which feels warm , with deliber@@ ately human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt his robot according to his convic@@ tions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the colour of the robot on the shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would look after a st@@ eppe @-@ woman progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have developed to robots with a silicon scal@@ p .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they find as promis@@ ingly as school@@ ing .
and then there are still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; who medi@@ ates the impression of sy@@ no@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion is war@@ med .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has their m@@ oods in the course of the day - really like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many troubled aspects of this rise of Sex robots - not least because they attempt to replace true human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , which is a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : contra@@ di@@ cted ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex play .
their origin and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dar@@ ker and deep outdoors in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for having sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will naturally not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their growing popularity , they still remain a preliminary on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what is sick@@ le from the edge zones , can be very educational in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very educational .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until they are the free market to give up permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly @-@ developed sex robots have been pl@@ under@@ ed in a time that the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which the White House has a president to have been attacked by women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the imm@@ utable body and the ej@@ ected eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these Sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with portrait @-@ propor@@ tions ) .
their builder , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have any medi@@ ation or background history , nothing which indicates independence or anything which could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jec@@ ting .
in other words , they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid Service
tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human being
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ ic of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that have polar@@ ised the US voters , also have families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Thank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump relatives .
we all assume that our filter bubble burst all of us .
less noticed is the power sl@@ umps , families put together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she re@@ minded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and completely on the same side .
in order to make the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it affects me in another context that there is also considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the emp@@ t@@ ying effect of his presi@@ dency has the force to push all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that we won &apos;t get away his bi@@ b one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a sc@@ atter@@ ing long @-@ term scenario , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of inde@@ x@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of the crazy - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ah , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild crime .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify for himself as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel at Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells in the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ce and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music gives it a curious manner .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage in fact - the topics Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I would have hired the Car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same as the option to pay an average 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also has pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no one is required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain
in the second time Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of be@@ ers , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first cut @-@ in prison because of murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by taking it several times through a door of the toilet emp@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ aders , who hid himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their purpose , this time against the six @-@ year @-@ term imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they may be indul@@ g@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Authority reported that they may rise at the Supreme Court of South Africa and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Flower School , the four @-@ t@@ wat@@ ery from F@@ ishing and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the school pupils go to the grammar school , four at the secondary school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Citi@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 29 students of the four classes , under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold took a strange egg , and left it out of his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken kis@@ ses a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken broke out of him , and the eag@@ les spread his wings on a high mountain .
afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders , to make the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for the integration , said School Director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
she wished to everyone , that he feels accepted in his new school .
they also followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who jumps over again and her parents .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she just leave her students after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time .
finally , she could rely on the wat@@ ery @-@ wat@@ ery .
finally , all students conclude a song from summer time and summer time .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight birth@@ marks have already been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians , imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ itim@@ ate people was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened control of the free camp@@ uses and place each one who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant money &apos;s money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ministry said that the court can impos@@ e a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
with the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are available for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the exhaust gas behavior of the E@@ TS , Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine of ACE Auto Club Europe gives inv@@ alu@@ ation :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the recorded software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates have been valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ arm@@ ament ( KBA ) has arranged the gateway to the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but still has no precise appointment .
Daimler told you to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their frames .
how long should I pull the equipment altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the relations from the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ elabor@@ ate could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE reveals itself to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would retreat , such S@@ met@@ anine .
can now a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where cycling should thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there are no value losses for older diesel so far .
the ACE reveals that you can still wait for sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first awards ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cul@@ tu@@ ation was announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ ers Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will be held a reception and participate with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
the winners of Le@@ ar &apos;s progressive TV series announced that this is why they have already announced their participation in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This presi@@ dency decided to completely neg@@ li@@ fy the arts and human rights - even the funds - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to take care of her view .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Zentrum is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the earlier winners of Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues to reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidate are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work is still great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , no application has yet to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city looks for the closest time an architect or civil engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should be - under the respect of the regular termination of the termination - still enough time for a work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Has@@ lach has acted to the administration association as a sub @-@ law authority , the applic@@ ant must demonstrate relevant agreements .
because this function wants to keep the town permanently .
if they can &apos;t fill this anymore , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg until Off@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the near@@ ness of the city and himself is important to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker who reports from a good company climate and a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : re@@ shaping the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the rainf@@ all parking lot are attached .
the Kin@@ etic Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stages of the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros in beech , &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers .
the work here is fun . &quot;
be ob@@ sol@@ itary for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great play @-@ room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexi@@ bly on many occasions .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old city stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an eye for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ lining city builder st@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the city council we@@ ars high responsibility .
he is building manager , &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on long@@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( drau@@ ght ) has been for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and want to stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good enterprise , but also for the other design of the city .
if you want to discover Roland W@@ acker would like to show the city of Has@@ lach a closed studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with field of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and building plann@@ ers .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ haus under@@ stands high and deep construction , construction planning , property management , construction of urban property , municipal office with building yard and under@@ side building authority including historical building site , including monument protection .
bike on pipes is thrown : south route blocked
according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had the blue bike ride across the road track ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ent freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the scene there were a ros@@ oter sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz coup , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators and the perpet@@ rators were brought in great danger even to the train .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the line and the delay and the costs for rail transport , there could also be even more cor@@ on@@ als of rail customers to the off@@ ender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum said , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be guided without disabled .
almost ten person@@ suits were fri@@ ended on Friday afternoon , two of which were travelling .
goods are not falling , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged some 200 metres in the out@@ lines .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study indicates the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , affecting about 1.3 million in the US , affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and caused stomach cr@@ amps , recur@@ ring or bloody confusion , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected are normally advised to relie@@ ve meat and dairy products in order to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant bo@@ wel .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that Immun@@ e cells are in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , do not enter into the body .
cells , which are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect body , without damage sensitive tissue .
if the equilibri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel .
in experiments , a type of tolerance of immune cell in mice was found that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium is needed tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an yp@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ate more anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel , if the same system work with people .
the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was seeking a kind of immune cell who discovered the tolerance when it had discovered that a group of study @-@ mice had such cells , but a different group of the same ancest@@ ral , which was accommod@@ ated , but it was not .
it pres@@ umed that the difference of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually living in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and found six bacterial species , which were present in mice with immune cells , but were lacking in mice .
mice were brought up in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they did not have the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not have developed this kind of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system , the researchers gave L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then led then small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on imm@@ ature immune cells being isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as the dol &apos;s 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ ism were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether j@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United had signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Sig@@ nature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed him in the H@@ alter role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to start its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent abst@@ ained from this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three further re @-@ commit , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new obligations .
&quot; three out of four , thank you for the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to the radar sh@@ iel@@ ding was the form of a Dream@@ liner .

new strike for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime minister had always looked forward to Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin .
only lack of stor@@ ks from the party , merely no head@@ wind from the wai@@ st@@ band - thus was the most important desire of the elections .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , it has fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , employees are seen from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing horror the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were descent .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal parliament sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Green .
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ Green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said the CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editor @-@ network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprised fra@@ ction of a Green Party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the rural election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
Michael Kell@@ ner is the Green Party Leader El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return its mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear for@@ gery of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return their mandate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the German President and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens Editor in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true either , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gro@@ ans a SPD parliamentary campaign as on Friday afternoon the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without his own government since the transition to the CDU .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the failures began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , re@@ ass@@ uring himself the comrades of his time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ites had smooth the party .
in the weeks afterwards , the comrades were drag@@ ged again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just created new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep blow .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because he made quite wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz is strug@@ gling for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in cr@@ iti@@ que since longer .
mi@@ ese re@@ fra@@ gment occurred .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , because in the past weeks , Weil was getting stronger to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
comrades of the former mayor of Hannover , to construct his power in Berlin , comrades in the surrounding area of Martin Schulz remained not hidden .
they left him , because they promised because of the stab@@ i@@ lization of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
because since the party , Weil is not guilty to the party of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens basically no fault .
and Schulz are not at all .
sometimes , the comrades will try to keep the own rows closed .
her wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the revol@@ ting par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ier@@ in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democrats , like Ms T@@ v@@ ests his own career eating over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editor in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS T@@ v@@ ests is not because of their person as direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but by the national list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters faced four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil for the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower Sax@@ on SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career thinking of a future CDU faction demands the election outcome , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said .
he called for setting up the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or it has given further additions to the CDU of Lower Saxony .
sponsors for the town centre III
if you want to renov@@ ate his house in the years , we can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g City Development began on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the start of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look back on that before .
since 1991 , it has been in reception areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation department I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development and not only to create new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , you received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , that it will be a rehabilitation area III .
the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 Euro should be from the country , the remainder of the municipality .
how is a rehabilitation department now ?
you will continue to explore Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory there is interest to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial limits could then move again .
the Ste@@ g spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out within the framework .
the core of the program are the re@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the living and labour conditions and ob@@ taining the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , which means per plot .
the rehabilitation department would then be set as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding is scheduled for January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the stock intake would only be performed , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation department had a question@@ naire to fill out .
in November or December , the pro@@ hibition decision should be carried out so that the next year with the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the occupied pre @-@ exam@@ inations .
it is about to evaluate and decide the urban failure , when it is refurb@@ ished and in which scope .
the plot is then also included in the basic book for the property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will go again to Emp@@ fingen and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires , which will be post@@ ally sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow fra@@ gment is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and bottom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unit , among other things about structural condition and san@@ itation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey question@@ naire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fiscal and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operation sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill if in the building premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be observed , Got@@ zel showed that a completed question@@ naire is not at the same time a request for funding .
new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of convey@@ ing agents according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - who first comes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there can be no subsi@@ dies to &quot; reserve &quot; later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of conclusion , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door@@ step to enter his office and even start with a hand@@ movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between his thum@@ b and po@@ inter and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ tar .
he cons@@ ulted with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory capacity in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant method is performed according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .

the White House &apos;s advertising costs cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the specifications of the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter , built in Connecticut , was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fighter car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the helicopter at the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event at his su@@ peri@@ ors , the Deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of service a second team would need a second team for the return flight .
the original flight area was during the event at the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the ground during the time .
from the records provided by the TIM@@ E , the recordings were not clear if a second flight line was required .
the Brands Act prohib@@ its Federal Government to utili@@ ze national property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could harm the event .
&quot; a question that we asked was if there was a violation of the Brands Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president had a violation for the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to appro@@ ve government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the Presi@@ dential plane was in front of the background of his first camp@@ ground r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise Zen@@ tim@@ eters .
as Tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training demand for the month , a civil servant said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours in this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential supports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have won the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no Budget for the Presi@@ dential F@@ lights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ el@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft belonging to the marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argue that the actual cost for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates put up is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course reasonable to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter when he entered the South La@@ wn of the Event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and began the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

team principal Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has respect for his opponents .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation .
straight on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to the Davis Cup operations .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Go@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will be as always hard for us .
you also need a good dose . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north stands practical .
his debut for blue and white might be Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
it currently works at the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella active French not to the Bundesliga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) competition comes to its first use in this season .

how America the O@@ MV can damage
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not succeed when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law for ti@@ ghtening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his H@@ ast , the law en@@ acted , &quot; the Congress held a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels damage the US invasion .
after all , the draft was to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the native O@@ MV , co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , are co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ iss is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump could even raise the sanctions by an executive order for life .

moving backwards : the city represents 46 kitchen staff
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table himself .
with fixed response partners for the children and a assignment of the team .
the clock will be turned back in the urban nur@@ series .
on 1 September the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ sery schools ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy leader in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still no house except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh ginger to cool .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city runs 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children have lunch at lunch@@ time and a warm meal .
last year at the end of the year 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need constantly grows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ day hours in the clinic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children remain until the age of 14 . &quot;
46 sub @-@ time forces from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the angel@@ ic foods , supplement it to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are firmly associated with a kiss , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as se@@ clu@@ sion units - deci@@ ding over the hour@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement more pedagog@@ ical concepts for kit@@ esur@@ fers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it is : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is worthwhile .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - is managed by the special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that they have turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ gae and foreign distri@@ butions for the city as the most economic , it is from the press office .
and that , even though 46 partial forces are re@@ printed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the education field even so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative of all members of the company , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are present in the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ fy for the role of vice @-@ presi@@ dents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be only be representative and credible when women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
there will be Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential election on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban have released threats against a choice trial , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed down peac@@ efully under a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ek said , a strong role for women will still rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan constitu@@ ency has reported that 1.2 million women of all registered 3.6 million voters were registered .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
one union wants to work with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had to weigh over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant which produces in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first , if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s offices , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s focused on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ ries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines are not ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ iser Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentr@@ ating strongly on the local community and the great area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow had urgently needed a th@@ ri@@ ving production at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ bu@@ cross at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we assess the ongoing commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross in which some questions were discussed openly .
we argu@@ ed with the staff that we are working as all companies working in a very competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business continuously checks - and that applies to all our business segments and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last years we invested more than 5 Million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and at all . should our work processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site from La League may certainly regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not im@@ itate in her persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after she had given an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have warned of Barcelona recently three years ago ?
the sensational approach took place in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sport@@ sman in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious in the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside the Catal@@ ans that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prosp@@ ect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they want to touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , so that will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association early this summer interest in the PS@@ G Mittel@@ feld player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to leave the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price quotes for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ kle Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ cy Dom@@ spar@@ rows report on the abuse of mis@@ use , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved .
this is the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
final report about the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ cy Dom@@ don@@ atzen further provides discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ser , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication to the German press agency , he was waiting for publication by the former rain@@ forest Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse for the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would be very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret on their own under@@ let or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that on reporting violence was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one would doubt that it would be punished by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and it is a perfect fres@@ cos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; schl@@ ager had been a quite normal educational means , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be finished with little children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final decision .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report written by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 rainf@@ alls were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ veness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , &quot; in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence have been applied .
especially at high Emot@@ ion@@ alism the punishment for the pupils was able to dis@@ integrate .
however , unlike many others , contrary to many others , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories of him combine with him . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report about the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ sburg Dom@@ sp@@ elt Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 Pages report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Property in the earth@@ en@@ ians &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for instance , a lot of students empha@@ size his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which is tangible , when a domain was given not a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ographer ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you are doing the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will come at all .
he is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of Mitt@@ ens or Mit@@ wis@@ s@@ edness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violent ex@@ cess@@ es at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere of action .
it can cause him to be late , experienced of it too late or first alle@@ g@@ ations to have taken seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was perceived by virtually all dents &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely ben@@ evol@@ ent teachers who supplied guys regularly with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y and always conf@@ is@@ cated from the grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high Emot@@ ion@@ ality , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ um@@ chen even before .
that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key b@@ und on the ground but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ards to the hair or ears , he already regre@@ ts years ago , deeply de@@ pressed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , it must be said that such an educational methods in the fra@@ ction of time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents as in teachers .
do you still know such products ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to that , what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre@@ school , are certainly dre@@ at@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then you wonder if there is not more to do with his awareness and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s brother , that many media just fell on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understood him will still be eager to work .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot on the topic of abuse during the Regen@@ cy Dom@@ spar@@ rows were reported .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also refer to any involvement or participation in the abuse of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted with the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a talented representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem during the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he would have had tim@@ ely findings ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that ... Bu@@ ben may have opened int@@ ru@@ sive and clear@@ er or rather more , than opposite their parents , Inter@@ course conduc@@ tors , trust teachers etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report says to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the fore@@ front of affected pupils and / or their surroundings , the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse has been concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , therefore , of every co @-@ knowledge .
thus , it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; at the Regen@@ cy Dom@@ spar@@ rows sold in the media .
the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the report &quot; Weg@@ look . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and bl@@ amed as an enormous mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately between the pre@@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , other accus@@ ations .
moreover , the report deals from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the entire terrible test pedagog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were dra@@ fted and mal@@ ign@@ ant . they were all suffered from the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have been re@@ igns .
but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do , because he got the boy first to her face , when they were already on the Dom@@ inion physi@@ asi@@ um .
on the way , like most witnesses , the topic &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; para@@ dies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the cathedral School ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there certainly was discipline , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the reproach will remain to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school , at which he was not working and responsible , ( such a witness ) was to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently conce@@ aled the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ inion physi@@ otherapy , who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , he points to this point &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that in the pre@@ school continues to be pract@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the risk of negative media , he recommended an urgent step .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as exam@@ inations in Bavaria .
before that , they appeared in a legal gre@@ y@@ way , as everyone knows of us .
it was also difficult for him to over@@ estimate where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away .
that just isn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 , the recru@@ itment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed to be un@@ fair to use today &apos;s pedagog@@ ical standards for the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking hist@@ ori@@ ans from the &quot; case of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has already been right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of violence and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then .
that &apos;s all very horrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally up .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear@@ cra@@ cks , and ears to pull , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment it was forbidden , he has also kept stri@@ pped off .
what image of his rainy season , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot;
came the issue of Prü@@ fer to Language as well ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : now , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a part @-@ part .
and yet , I know by no means that he led a tough regim@@ ent there .
but also this has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ spl@@ ant , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone , one doesn &apos;t even make a big singer and stand in front of every success in which field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in discussions with her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ man : through work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , very believing and heart@@ y good people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly something .
I regularly get in regular contact with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows remain in contact with him today , 23 years after his retirement , to visit him - he is almost blind and to treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not given him to this day , so that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but still a lo@@ vable respect was to which they still look up and worship them .
and , again , clearly , all that one acc@@ uses him are education methods that were on the order back then .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ ner .
that is the evil intent , which stands behind it , is not too obvious .
for the report which has just been published , reli@@ eved him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gotten big mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably won &apos;t know anyone who had to know the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reg@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
