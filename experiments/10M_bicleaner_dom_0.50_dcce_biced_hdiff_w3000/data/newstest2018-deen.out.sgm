<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your gaze to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are going to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb which is now being dug out for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners produce the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get an exciting one, because the car-Navi showed up a green meadow instead of a rebypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer by Geoport as Bavaria of the state government, are everything else but current - yet very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then how cities and congregations have changed in the area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a splattered canvas, which is not equal to such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large oversight card, detailed maps, so-called primitive data leaves, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian State Administration Management between 1810 and 1864 and replaced the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition of war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Eventually, when French troops returned to Lunéville on February 9, 1801, there were the neighbours of today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "and thus the Bayerische surveying Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is how all others can be found on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, the sendling is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map, i.e. 1877, in the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the wling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses are concentrated in 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where is the Westpark today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: during the view a smaller piece with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten prejugs from the so-called "Urge" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no small parcels there today no farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of the sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since the 1810 stage of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the Urpositional leaf, one reads only the street names" "" "on the sky" "" "or from the hill" "" "on the sky" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delights.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irish "Auf der Auer Lüens."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudder headed the facility - the psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and finished the chains of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "in addition, he is forbidden to use the personnel to use violence against the inmates," "" "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who employs an exhibition with Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first place, and later was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district irrenfacility in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet up in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought a building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth centre with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the TSV Munich football pitch, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built into architectural shape on the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as "main square" the Kaufingerstraße was named "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a Gruber chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where this day will take the pre-work and take place on 5 April 2017 on the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn sign.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting egler the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Union to foster Farming has issued a warning for coloured people who are due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state of Missouri." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, who have to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri, as a series of fragile, racified incidents occur in the entire state and listed here," "" "says it in the opinion of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recent law of Missouri, which criminalizes people to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the State that aim undisproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warnings, said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injury of civil rights, people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard nor heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has exhibited for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group organised incidents like racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after having no longer had any fuel during the journey through the state and was accused by the police of Missouri without having a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri, in which black motorists will be more frequent in the state 75 percent more frequently than whiteness." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring along the money, or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hassverbreak in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation program of the FBI, which levels the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warnings is also an answer to a new missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after immigration authorities have adopted immigration authorities to ban people for immigration problems, according to the ACLU on further race profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent years, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>

<seg id="68">"" "" "" "the fishing" "" "turnout" "" "project is a successful project and will be continued coming next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU out of the CDU and Kordula Kovac issued a picture on-site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-excavation of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishing Federation of CDU met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann bestowed an insight into his company where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as well as many kittens and accommodated in five flats.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "Schwarzwald's milk" "" "is for him of alternative marketing issues for the milk of its cows, so swivel." ""</seg>

<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, much needs to be processed using the sense sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topic of topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental operation and used them without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not perform a biogas.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the afforestation of surfaces could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thoughts about how they continue their farm," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in critique because of promoting</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is 40 hectares that cannot be hosted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of €71 was promoted by half over leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers stopped 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of Weieraun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and land maidens it does not work." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The landscape-care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of incinerary.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the closure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR collected funding is essential.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area may not be worse (slopes over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">Currently, the request of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The closing area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack these statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic tomt in a hitty dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatters and Liberty Imitators had laughed at him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took their importance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta replied, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factly right, but how he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemporary resonance to the rebellious words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the nucleary of the poor:" "" "your troubles, your poor, and longing to breathe freely, to breathe freely, / the end of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "falling waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - were very good that they had completed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "" "" "the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by portraying the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it long from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early Neoconservative, that bring the American flame to the converted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not to light up the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limnaigh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense that the world is looking for people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue spoke to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminded of a time when only two villi belonged to the UK.</seg>

<seg id="134">"I speak with people in the Scottish institutes of sport and think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh produced quite naturally were magnificent. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 villi are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance Muir runs on this path and has set five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, one after a great season, which included victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, as the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the men's capitals says that they are" "" "enormously proud" "" "to the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team but in some cases even at the medals and the finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team capitals is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi, who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captains?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics over Facebook: throw you not for a public post, if you do not have to fuel up electing voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers beat him because of the Domestic Policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimps in critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said," "" "The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who work to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and erased their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Government's staff entailed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's very important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor, in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with his voters and playing his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the government's side - which is considered officially a public forum, which is considered officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governance and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of Trollen or moose-filled people that swinging the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And they are just genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no troll.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments will be respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest has cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer in Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not bottled, but she asked for Hassailbreak.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook generation makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same thing that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical positions and to burn, burn, or demonstrators to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that just happens digital.</seg>

<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>

<seg id="199">The number of newspapers hide between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailboxes hit the lead.</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique little treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain to Tumour Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the certificate according to the document, on the Tummy mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, was located next to the village and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumour, the "mountain" of the third, national settler of the village.</seg>

<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window plates were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was ledensely.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 the French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tummy Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler until 1869.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight 1834 a storm threw the bell tower and the half collapsed.</seg>

<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine add to the generous ceiling height optimal use.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to have high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use a 12.5 feet high ceilings, which was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively to solve the award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel movement is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange rooms so that they were stacked over each other, without that we had to decorate with gaps." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Returvius looks down through the glamorous areas.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Red wooden furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting use the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">"" "" "" "the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous noise, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a tax door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains the fan of steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important that if you push the door, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room Joanne able to gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the ground - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they managed to enlarge the soil area and use high-quality materials that provide space with its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and they are therefore helping to create an emotional binding in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in electric outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased levels of square from somewhat defaulted into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump of new staff of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss in a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met in his first day of work with executive employee, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information, which fall into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or on lettering - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count trump by overseeing its media dictatment.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relation to television dates back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV show is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate was upset because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persuaded," said the former election agent Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time" "" "the key to hold trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that" "" "mumps Twitter habit ever" "" "was under control" "", "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps they know something that we don't know what we don't know - that mumps tweets could have even more combustible.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made him away a few times, annoyance with him, then their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing it, that trump controversies is created.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, who are composed of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump Material, which may be promoting their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported about the preference of advisors to surate the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press reports, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he stiffened to find out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when somebody called the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the site of the internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a pile to be" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banished for chicans permanent from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he claims the wrong accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask for employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and to document the ump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive selves, and his advisers always strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1485">Mueller examines if there were agreements between trumps or Convictors and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are supposed to act as advisor to the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also increased more and more trumps private and business environment under the magnifier.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote some weeks ago that the Sondererich Trump picked up himself into the centre and I am looking for a proposal if the president might hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>

<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be switched on by the Prosecution to unloading persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN Sender CNN, pre-invitations were exhibited already around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Individuals who were involved in the meeting were summoned to a statement, named it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps served as advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam assistant director Paul Manafort.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Because of this root, accusations were violated against Trump, he didn't want to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for a position of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under enormous pressure due to the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and can be crushed if a piece is left at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and urges so much water as it gives to the melts itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, loss of failure causes the glacier to the sea directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only very small, writes the British research project for the Observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>

<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the obedience list of the government or the Cartelle, a catalogue of criminals that make chaos dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest in the violence, and while in the whole country the bodies were frequent, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto did his office in December 2012. 589 are made for attacks and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>

<seg id="1824">At Rioce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa although they are inseparable, although the terrain is even more traverse.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>

<seg id="1832">He left one woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is virtually nothing about silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans' arrest in January and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest battlements of the country, because rival factions were struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of enchanted, two-story mausoleums for drug, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>

<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to do so, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues could annimitate that he would always be there.</seg>

<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the revenues and advertising grew.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved to publish hard treaties without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else would be dealing with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Rioce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drugs history, wherever it was.</seg>

<seg id="1977">It is light until moderate injury, said a police precher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great array of rescue vehicles was at the accident.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who frequently drives train, know that in addition to delays or passively trains the ticket checks are among the greatest nuances.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV reader discuss a bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has outdated the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed in our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates building that a gallery of more customers is moving into the city, the other businesses also benefit, fear the enemies that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Additionally: the gallery is planned just on the property, on which the farmers market hall is, in which 13 companies offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work, the end will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Beda-Platz, with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a good weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the product offered there is fresh, most of them are offered directly from the producer.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall just by bigger companies, because the mids are often not portable for a retailers.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market launch during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration, if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, that almost undifferentiate the cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tubing and haircuts, which you were sent to us by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analyst made a sentence of 35 years of imprisonment after she publicly contained diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has turned their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dismissive dissident, when he had turned into office only three days.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from the 30 portraits, such as someone who can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent determining of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been talking about the identification than a woman since their puberty was convicted of 20 charges, including six breaches against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits comfortably on a driver seat and a platinum blonde perforig is - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strange artefacts like cigarette stills and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit this time and she could not take pictures, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were trained to unequal letters that were out of several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Supper Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who would foresee a future in which the President Chelyish deliberate judgement and could be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would call for the release of seven brutal years in a Kansas jail term, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"" "" "" "there is also something deep in the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump will take a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find the rigid divisions that he should actually solve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "as Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a specific reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for the artistic statement below, called "i" in their surname (the "i" in their surname) is an end of the "automatic dissipation which have been the foundation of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly-developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it, is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is a page of the Comic-Novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she shows with a free efon in hand in hand out of the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharky, Emeritus Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take up their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the paint color of the robot, its form of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies provide a lot of it and we'll see them much more common," "" "said Mr. Sharky upon publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpupers have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon scalp which feels warm, with deliberately human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adapt his robot according to his convictions," "" "and select everything from the colour of the robot on the shape of the nipple to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would look after a steppe-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpubs have developed to robots with a silicon scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they find as promisingly as schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," who mediates the impression of synoternity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," the website of True Companion is warmed.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has their moods in the course of the day - really like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects of this rise of Sex robots - not least because they attempt to replace true human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, which is a step on Frigid (called here: contradicted) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it's called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex play.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement point to something darker and deep outdoors in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for having sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR remembers their growing popularity, they still remain a preliminary on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is sickle from the edge zones, can be very educational in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very educational.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until they are the free market to give up permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"" "" "" "there is a certain overlapping that these highly-developed sex robots have been plundered in a time that the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which the White House has a president to have been attacked by women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the immutable body and the ejected eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these Sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with portrait-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to its" "" "personalities" "", "the robots represent no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have any mediation or background history, nothing which indicates independence or anything which could disturb the imagination of total subjecting.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterpart slaves.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study indicates the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflamed bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, affecting about 1.3 million in the US, affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and caused stomach cramps, recurring or bloody confusion, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected are normally advised to relieve meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that Immune cells are in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect body, without damage sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an anti-inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a type of tolerance of immune cell in mice was found that carry a particular bacterium in its entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium is needed tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an ypyptophan rich diet tolerate more anti-inflammatory bowel, if the same system work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral candidate Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was seeking a kind of immune cell who discovered the tolerance when it had discovered that a group of study-mice had such cells, but a different group of the same ancestral, which was accommodated, but it was not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced and found six bacterial species, which were present in mice with immune cells, but were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were brought up in a sterile environment, so that they did not have the intestinal microbiom and they did not have developed this kind of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria looked at the immune system, the researchers gave L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then led then small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells being isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism, known as the dol's 3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophanism were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether jyptophan side-products from L. reuteri develop the cells like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2632">The surprised fraction of a Green Party led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the rural election, its red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP opposition.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Michael Kellner is the Green Party Leader Elke Tvests to return its mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-President of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without his own government since the transition to the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The failures began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation department I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the surplus was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">"" "for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" "" "successful project" "" "- it is finally important to promote the inner development and not only to create new building areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, you received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that it will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amounts to 833 333 Euros, of which 500 000 Euro should be from the country, the remainder of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a rehabilitation department now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">You will continue to explore Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">However, it also plays a role, whether in the planned territory there is interest to renovate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial limits could then move again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The Steg spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellars presented the content of the federal government program "Social City," which would then be carried out within the framework.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program are the realisation of inner cities, improving the living and labour conditions and obtaining the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, which means per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation department would then be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for funding is scheduled for January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, the stock intake would only be performed, as part of those involved in the rehabilitation department had a questionnaire to fill out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the prohibition decision should be carried out so that the next year with the renovations can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each Commune had to carry out the occupied pre-examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about to evaluate and decide the urban failure, when it is refurbished and in which scope.</seg>
<seg id="2695">The plot is then also included in the basic book for the property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will go again to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be postally sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, after the helicopter at the South Lawn, after the recordings of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is an unusual event with high visibility," the Commandeur of HMx-1 wrote on the eve of the event at his superiors, the Deputy Marinekommandeur for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long remained until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of service a second team would need a second team for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight area was during the event at the helicopter, while security personnel remained at the ground during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, the recordings were not clear if a second flight line was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Brands Act prohibits Federal Government to utilize national property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets show that HMx-1 asked whether the event could harm the event.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we asked was if there was a violation of the Brands Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," the deputy commander answered.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMx-1 has no Budget for the Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did the PSG Barcelona warned about three years before Neymar?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The site from La League may certainly regret her interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not imitate in her persecution of Neymar after she had given an offer of £189 million to trigger its freewheel clause, but have warned of Barcelona recently three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach took place in the summer, because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the termination, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sportsman in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious in the way that Neymar has forced his way outside the Catalans that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned about three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparkle Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regency Domsparrows report on the abuse of misuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger was relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">Final report about the abuse scandal at the Regency Domdonatzen further provides discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisser, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication to the German press agency, he was waiting for publication by the former rainforest Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse for the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"" "" "" "there would be very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret on their own underlet or their then false assessment of the processes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor," "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand criticised that on reporting violence was measured with" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one would doubt that it would be punished by" "" "shameful and shameful acts" "", "but the" "" "degree of medial manipulation" "", "says the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "the princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "" "we like to go to the church and it is a perfect frescos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "it also pointed out that in her youth," "" "schlager had been a quite normal educational means," "" "to be finished with little children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They will be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final decision.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report written by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 rainfalls were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" "" "with high plausiveness" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domsparrows were sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary," in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high Emotionalism the punishment for the pupils was able to disintegrate.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, unlike many others, contrary to many others, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories of him combine with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report about the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspelt Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 Pages report on the "Incidents of Violence of Property in the earthenians" is a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For instance, a lot of students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which is tangible, when a domain was given not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you are doing the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger will come at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of Mittens or Mitwissedness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violent excesses at the preschool took place outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can cause him to be late, experienced of it too late or first allegations to have taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "redemption," "" "and" "" "redemption," "" "and" "" "redemption" "" "was perceived by virtually all dents" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent report," "" "sincere," "" "sincere," "" "sincere," "" "competently" "", "as extremely benevolent teachers who supplied guys regularly with cakes, cookies and candy and always confiscated from the grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high Emotionality, which led to Wutausumchen even before.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the key bund on the ground but also gave ear-cowards to the hair or ears, he already regrets years ago, deeply depressed and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it must be said that such an educational methods in the fraction of time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such products?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to that, what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, are certainly dreatal.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "then you wonder if there is not more to do with his awareness and role as a brother of Benedict XVI's brother, that many media just fell on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understood him will still be eager to work.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot on the topic of abuse during the Regency Domsparrows were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also refer to any involvement or participation in the abuse of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted with the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a talented representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem during the education of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not familiar with parents and siblings, certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he would have had timely findings (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that... Buben may have opened intrusive and clearer or rather more, than opposite their parents, Intercourse conductors, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report says to the very clear result:" "" "that in the forefront of affected pupils and / or their surroundings, the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse has been concerned is Georg Ratzinger, therefore, of every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "non-violence" at the Regency Domsparrows sold in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the report "Weglook."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and blamed as an enormous melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The entire terrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were drafted and malignant. they were all suffered from the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states must have been reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domenellmeister had nothing to do, because he got the boy first to her face, when they were already on the Dominion physiasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the way, like most witnesses, the topic "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradies" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the cathedral School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there certainly was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the reproach will remain to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school, at which he was not working and responsible, (such a witness) was to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently concealed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dominion physiotherapy, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this point, he points to this point" "", "that in the preschool continues to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the risk of negative media, he recommended an urgent step.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as examinations in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they appeared in a legal greyway, as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to overestimate where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the recruitment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed to be unfair to use today's pedagogical standards for the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking historians from the "case of anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable to all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of violence and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very horrible and I'm glad that it's finally up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplines and punishment, i.e. earcracks, and ears to pull, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment it was forbidden, he has also kept stripped off.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his rainy season, Georg Ratzinger has played with you for the book "My brother of the Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the issue of Prüfer to Language as well?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only a part-part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">And yet, I know by no means that he led a tough regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this perfectionism, it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world transplant, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, one doesn't even make a big singer and stand in front of every success in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in discussions with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesman: through work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, very believing and hearty good people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in regular contact with how many former Domsparrows remain in contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, to visit him - he is almost blind and to treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not given him to this day, so that he was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but still a lovable respect was to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, again, clearly, all that one accuses him are education methods that were on the order back then.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the evil intent, which stands behind it, is not too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now there would be a 93-year-old man who has gotten big merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably won't know anyone who had to know the" "" "regress" "". "" ""</seg>
