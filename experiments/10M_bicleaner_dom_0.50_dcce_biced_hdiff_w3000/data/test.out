that did the Hollywood star in an interview clearly un@@ am@@ big@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers or got stuck out of the outside label which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the recent &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
as a result , the actress can spend their time at home , in the TV with lo@@ cker@@ em d@@ utt and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .

Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a little variety with a ride at the beach at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa .
for the 58 year old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holiday evening , they pursued at the fast gal@@ lop home to the animal comfort .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; he says Lang@@ er .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left his family through the system of the AL@@ RV , to a horse , he could not even come to photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sport@@ s@@ ilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala &quot; Golden Sport pyramid . &quot;
the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete is not fond of awards .
Bundes@@ bequ@@ est , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ mired him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid .
on Saturday , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means giving me a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; was recorded with 15 other outstanding athletes on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the excellent belong to the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ di and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ru@@ d@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Spr@@ ite Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these venues came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential compet@@ itor is one of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to hold in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish and regul@@ ate the economy to death , he says .
but by contrast , it would be quite different , he asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
he will reg@@ ain regul@@ ators , and he will be strong for a wide control reform with lower controls , for private people and businesses .
Clinton said against it : the state has given certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both of them are very close to infrastructure .
in the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost answer .
the democratic candidate announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state treas@@ urer Te@@ hr@@ y @-@ Wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so multi @-@ internal discussions could be given to Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive the coal transport in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , to den@@ ounce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to strengthen and strengthen renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ an trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
they should then be paid even better , Clinton calls for around Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the minimum wage must be up , then he says he doesn &apos;t change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of both camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to spur growth .
his critics stop him , so the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
Clinton &apos;s share on the other side is Clinton who wants to pay at least by the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every whis@@ per woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone flee alone , almost daily life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he gu@@ ises with big eyes cur@@ i@@ ously in the room .
his mother star@@ es onto the table top .
until she notice that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 persons live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard off the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who reaches here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persecuted politically because they are torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves away because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ cible , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced prost@@ itution .
this is pushing it away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tugs are demanding for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end when they arrived in Germany are ir@@ re , tells me .
even here , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worse .
this leads to approximately 90 percent of women living in the district in Munich , who are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar to they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know , I need more accommodations for them , B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are no such thing in governments of governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , only poultry women are not accommod@@ ated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ ver of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are stories in some common ground floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that has been published for the Committee , it is said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy or women are staying together , it may come together - for@@ cing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women of this protective needs can be felt at the crowd , which takes place on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since it has been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily create a second house .
Regist@@ rar : demands for new working action
the assist@@ ants asked their union to appro@@ ve new working action in their disputes regarding a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working action from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been given to minister to worry about the treaty .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students voted for the ref@@ usal of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problems , which led to the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request@@ ing official new talks to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has made a formal application on a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of calcul@@ ative working action that began in early September .
the disputes led that assist@@ ants visited this year six times , the first overall failures in the N@@ HS history .
the director of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana re@@ signed following the election of the agreed contrac@@ tual terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the contract for physi@@ cians would inev@@ it@@ ably be introduced in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands of the hands and an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin tak@@ eth his Turkish opposite player in the gold @-@ g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot defend this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iled a bit of mal@@ od@@ ly and radiant heat , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances .
but on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; love &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had like something like it would never happen to happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable bol@@ le showed that Russia &apos;s position didn &apos;t forget anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time has been sli@@ pped .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , who fell to his back .
the crime was even bigger , as it was committed by a promised friend .
the v@@ et@@ ro@@ wer will re@@ build , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry for everything the blame .
the serious accus@@ ations from executive officials , that Erd@@ og@@ ans would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which would be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disp@@ uted this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce are obvious .
Erdogan is primarily needed to get all friends that he can get after he had failed last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and char@@ gers will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late a@@ illed ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the public TV attracted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural import will be re@@ leg@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists stay long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious in the West , since there was a response to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ongoing gro@@ unding over the snow ent@@ emp@@ o of EU accession talks and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , Russian President , in Ankara , won a bonus for the attempted coup attempt to support the elected state organs .
indeed , this is a self @-@ understanding for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ y palace in the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , which once described me a analysts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Alliance of Foreign Side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries which viol@@ ate themselves from the West and are now badly treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support the int@@ enti@@ onal sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first call , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even ro@@ amed the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Turkey failed to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus on what a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey - it is certainly better that the two states talk at least once again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside of Scotland are no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
in the BBC Scotland , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been used to protect other end @-@ consumer funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsor@@ ing , taking six Nations Rug@@ by up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the main head office , and the IP@@ O , will change to Nat@@ ure@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private client business which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be on our Investor Relations as well as to the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursu@@ ing any global goals , but local goals .
each of these stamps will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his six Nations Sponsor@@ ing no longer progress and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his Sport @-@ Sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the Bank of brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3@@ .000@@ th profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3@@ .000@@ ,000 profits
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3@@ .000@@ ,000 British profit from New@@ market in Friday .
he sat at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , at his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy to have happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the itch when he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ys@@ ers had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career path
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ ast@@ ically has fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekly and big @-@ tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has had a winner in the UK almost 30 years , what is great .
he has a living person , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had initially encountered difficulty when he returned from his six month to lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y its branches and to his top form .
and it &apos;s not yet a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to a minimum of 50@@ .@@ ten years .
Russian Putin is fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest tru@@ ce of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was representative of the Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn , in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it &apos;s called ( in Russian ) that later he later became the principal of protocols and atro@@ op@@ ers of the government .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of government and inspec@@ tions to support your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his followers .
see the smiling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a meeting with President Putin , it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was coming back at his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the consequence of a kind of power struggle here ?
nobody currently knows this .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was appointed as a potential President , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - came across large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation with me at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say - an estimated post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential government for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a member of the K@@ GB state Security Council .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onal Intelligence Service ( FS@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his Deputy .
when Putin made his power to the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once , Ivan@@ ov could have been president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second official term , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken from another , close ally of Putin &apos;s ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ land Cros@@ sing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion @-@ expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ awe@@ eds of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ geb@@ lä@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scrap parts .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics ( Keith Brown ) held a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings .
we are all witness of a engineering at this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity which require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks receives a concrete way for the deck , which means that the whole Deck is ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first clas@@ p represents a significant milestone at each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ looking and deep structure .
after installation of the last traffic @-@ section and its connection with the Northern Tur@@ m@@ deck train , we had to close the existing gap on the north or side of the country .
this was reached by pulling the northern slopes of 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and very sensitive activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons , and at an inc@@ line of about 3 % had to be drawn upwards .
pag@@ an , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from the fishing boat of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station starts on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble to swim in safety while their boat was moving from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw what the boat turned around and made us worst of the boat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the b@@ ail@@ out station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat except their reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at age 60 and found on a boat hanging out without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal path and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , this triggered the boat cap@@ turing the boat from the person who contributed the boat .
someone has woke today about these men .
difficult injured - man stands on his ex @-@ girlfriend .
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police stepped in yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead the alcohol off@@ ender cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when they came into the apartment , he sto@@ cked twice on her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and in the body .
the police could catch the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ min@@ ated by his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to re@@ ass@@ ure their brother .
but she could not move it , to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met ex @-@ habitats of the man .
when the two women re @-@ roasted the flat , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old moved his sister to the side and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ ger affordable apartments ?
the SPD and Green mean : investors will have to become much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 favourable apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who should build the favorable apartments ?
one scheme is still lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments , however , can also be found in stock .
however , the great dispute in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are investors trying to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to be at least 10 percent in such areas but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing programme that will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed , should provide inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants to stop har@@ sh@@ ages for investors .
regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , having a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market .
the concept of action is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
yet the program is not completely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
how to balance the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding will run in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plan of planning , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased by the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought about bringing homes back into pricing .
this is possible in the West city .
in one blow , the problem can be solved .
because in the West city , the end of the year is dead@@ lines .
around 1800 apartments one could go back to the prices of affordable apartments .
only : that do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the West city is dra@@ stically increased , one gets away from the end of the so @-@ called mixing .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts shall no longer be given .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CDU must take with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been focusing on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck that pays off
it is fascinating to watch as the world is changing .
that teenagers and child are no longer able to play outside , but rather it is prefer@@ able to spend their free time on screens in the last decade of many be@@ mo@@ urn .
at Pok@@ emon Go you go to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last@@ ly on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I consider myself of course based on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later formed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop@@ culture , interest in the release of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players are going outside with their smartphone outside and searching for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and when they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and le@@ ap@@ ed for searching the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35@@ ,000 users recently , the Washington Post told that within two days of launching the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent , who jumped from 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw material to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns of health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active for deaf ears every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that it is fun to do .
thus three pillars of the health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even conclude new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there is also m@@ ür@@ ric playing destro@@ yers which have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk towards a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could already follow our activity , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the New will lose its appeal and the use is reduced with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and helping many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in ladies
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
definitely brilliant on a whole line .
and now also Olympic Champion .
19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast on Thursday to the multi@@ compet@@ itor and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly seen before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ on Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig &apos;s bal@@ ken during the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a surplus value and the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final score was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success makes them in the same league such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought up their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ le has dominated the last three years of their sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I have ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a last trial in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bal@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ class of women at the Olympic Summer Festival in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ jana pulled the first medal on Tuesday as she retired at the retirement party of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a call@@ sign .
although it insist@@ ed on their long course on the top , never planned the future , it is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music , which would match at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , trained in the bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition for a victory competition , which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly by two turns , the image de@@ pressed .
pig @-@ beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - listen .
she again pulled back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig &apos;s bal@@ ken again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground there was another one on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently when she was expecting their escape - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on bil@@ it shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision described to be a reality in her collecting book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a low@@ case at Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after being exerc@@ ised , she threw himself to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ und , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for making it , the fast @-@ broad@@ ening twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot by car in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot that killed in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a fire fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police did not seem that the tri@@ ples murder doesn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 contri@@ buting to the adult victims .
the police pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investigation led the investig@@ ator to become a close look , whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in h@@ isp@@ anic residential items were killed within four months in nine attacks and injured two more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expos@@ e the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised by her injuries and died afterwards .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have also published a police report on shooting , which aims at an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the thir@@ teen murder and assumed that it was the factory of the series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat and ball@@ fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the fe@@ west of its age , Edmund Mikro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I did not create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I did not let myself .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund never can recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they beat him to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund was neither sitting nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year . he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , who Edmund opted for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; before . &quot;
&quot; we bring it a sign language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character - says she . Edmund invented some characters .
micro @-@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how life that is influenced by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still knows not .
I haven &apos;t asked about the forecast for a long time because I &apos;m not expecting you to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers from babies with birth defects that were caused by the z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it is better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , flood gives occasion to rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ area floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is flooded the shore and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Louisiana , John B@@ el Edwards divided that state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and aid to the communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Government , divided the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is widely used in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service caused that additional 3 to 5 inch of rain can fall in this area .
in the south of Alab@@ ama on Friday a flood breakfast system was deployed , while Mobile continues to go@@ vern .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood after the weekend record levels .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded during the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream desc@@ ending flood in Ascension is a danger since it is flowing through the saved rivers slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Mor@@ ov@@ y , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived at 09.@@ 00 the highest point that was ever recorded .
rescue team still sw@@ apped people from the flood in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among the ones who were saved by glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rise to rise overnight .
he said he had a further step , who lives near , had warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and flowing in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she had never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabled and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was still heavy rainf@@ all , and that the authorities appro@@ ve evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann a ob@@ server close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been totally su@@ cked through the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities agreed that heavy rainf@@ alls and roads flooded the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliated station WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded with floo@@ ding houses .
the residents were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now were both flooded .
the super@@ visor of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved by 72 people and seven pets allowed by the floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency notes were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ate .
&quot; once the water starts to fall back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the church Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozen streets were closed and sand@@ bags were provided for ship@@ ments , hoping to keep the water from their homes and stores .
&quot; the last great floods , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in Var@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys , said that it continues to go@@ vern the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses should be reported as over@@ flooded but on Friday until now there were no reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , lives already in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; captured by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week was already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents told that Brown suffered several fire@@ arms , including in the lungs , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his small body was b@@ anded by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z with the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it just .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the radio that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old that is located in a critical condition , shot on the station .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police currently investig@@ ates whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a fire @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were paraly@@ sed by the crime scene .
it seems that it is clearly managed by a prolonged struggle .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that of more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three monkeys , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , is Je@@ w@@ ess and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ in , rounds every proud .
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , number one was one of the female gymn@@ asi@@ es an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to be a witness of the unbelievable performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they were expecting , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ oc@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American who won gold for women at an individual meeting event .
club member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witness@@ ing the top of this sport , but don &apos;t look around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it in the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team is only four gymn@@ ast in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks so much that Tur@@ ns become an expensive sport and Turner first and foremost in private gymn@@ ast@@ ics that come up from parents , who come up for training , setup , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these gy@@ ms lie in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs the Turner will get their overall training and this is a pleasure for families and a long term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the action .
we must enable the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enable a powerful and easier to access gy@@ ms .
I founded my train@@ ee for 20 years .
with my events we have provided free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and H@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ ast@@ ics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health , and for training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the action and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants wants to organise more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggestion
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ .000 assistance doctors who vote in a election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans s@@ quar@@ ed to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every further delay would be dam@@ aging to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly work , to improve care of un@@ loading times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Commission , shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants agreed to heat the current contract after serious concerns , in particular that it will heat the current crisis crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at only eight weeks , still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is going out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks during the government and sometimes on the de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that was done by a crime that Jeremy Hun@@ t had made it last month for the last month that his door was always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and concerns the wor@@ sen@@ ators &quot; concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants did not make it clear that they are ready to carry out further working action .
the last strike in April saw an boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 ro@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , since hospitals and specialists were included in order to grant doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes caused by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wishes to appro@@ ve a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 54@@ ,000 Regist@@ rar , which are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called for assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ fighting measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing staff and their families only concerned , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked with the Committee of Assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health and other Minist@@ ries positively on concerns about the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility at training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ricul@@ um , training holidays , and the gender Ministry of Education , Health Education and Health of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , after recommended by the authorities to appro@@ ve this more people for a longer period of time .
the mat@@ ory medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
the medication is already given a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fatty acids in the arter@@ ial walls that form Bel@@ ts .
when the day breaks , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through blood flow and drain the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a and is marketed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making it more unlikely by the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the start design of N@@ ICE , which is released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month capture of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg , with twice daily consumption of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health research centre said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively had a heart attack in the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes .
due to a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the conduc@@ tion design recommends no treatment that proceeds over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness gives election fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to such widespread election fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating rule report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es interfer@@ es with the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ en@@ thou@@ ses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ ion Government , who now is an anti @-@ corrupt regime , said that the police should be allowed to set off le@@ aps out of choices outside choices to protect voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended that voters should lead a reference to himself in order to prove their identity .
at present , a v@@ oter must merely mention his name and address .
the report suggests , un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person to prevent their vote , to prevent someone who chooses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committ@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only serve against election fraud , but also the municipal government is meant to protect , protect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the mayor &apos;s mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man decided after a lit@@ any to corrupt and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices of his office should be revealed .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have dict@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics into silence with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have passed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is a reli@@ ant duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the episode of an im@@ itation when one person chooses anyone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud across the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed himself particularly al@@ ar@@ ming on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of writing - at the elderly members of Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including the lead of failures , to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in order to choose from the Will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ or or mund@@ ane background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have ignored such a behaviour as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beliefs concerning the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition of editing political activists writing documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires even harder registration checks to prevent the electoral list of immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes .
consider options to question v@@ oter prior to your selection .
do not use remote ink on the finger of a person , once she has given her voice to prevent someone twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of one person to make sure they are optional .
a triple limit on applications to an automatic mail@@ box .
pro@@ hibition that political activists process complete correspondence and env@@ elop@@ es of correspondence .
the police give force to fire , to establish poll@@ ing stations .
a change of the amend@@ ment to inti@@ mid@@ ation due to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ ers for@@ b@@ ade in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ vation of the training to ensure the employees will prevail that voters alone will go into the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets was not a criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was sufficiently well known due to a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Controller &quot; of the election regi@@ stry of the Town H@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heir to the mother of parliament , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ying of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler double @-@ acc@@ ant and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be available this week over the French cyclist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except the edge and the band that proved to be an impressive double @-@ acc@@ ant of the du@@ k@@ ine of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by no means the only one to have gold @-@ fighting Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least if you may not grant social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ r@@ ens to time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ lands .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
apart from a double but@@ tery on the wheel r@@ ink , many people referred to the internet as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o might be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ c@@ anny .
in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave that he had already heard about his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; announced Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as compli@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more in focus : the elabor@@ ate simil@@ arity between British Wide Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double @-@ acc@@ ant to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison .
one step higher : this User is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
another tender comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ man , who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal flo@@ mer@@ in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ less skin and blond hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Americans was att@@ est@@ ed by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also like the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory is put into the space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to talk to him many .

another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you will present the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like ra@@ cists . #
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment has been broadcast on a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate form@@ ulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC had ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the people who have responded to the comments on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with over 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ates quickly and made a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it correctly that these statements were made and that it was enabled to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ ze quickly with our viewers on the show and our followers in social media .
to find one clear@@ er , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald who ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment which I made after women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympic hand , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who check out under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyer did not know where to see , when a woman went out of her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked into it , she pulled away and put them back to the shelf .
they moved on and tried four pairs of sub@@ h@@ osen in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she came back and the shop left without buying something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of sub@@ pants from the pool , pulled out her own strings and pants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled back the pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because she put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other sub@@ pants , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything to go back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone who observed someone - or could think about the person who would buy sub@@ du@@ es under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to think that someone would take shelter back home that had a different person , and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale , after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple , and find out that another woman had her and she went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is to be aware of that on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone , &quot; deliber@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it more secure for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wers to your pre@@ dat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn back from behind , then you should turn out to be a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the Line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knees into the bar and spin , while the att@@ acker from pain is crum@@ bling , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while they set the weapon to him .
with attack@@ ers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun , take the weapon and turn it , so the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , take the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est thing - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .

before losing every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to be embar@@ r@@ assed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of losing the flush button of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash@@ basin .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke to physi@@ cians and medical professionals to promote bo@@ wel bacteria and their own health .
luckily , nothing left , what he left , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to flush buttons of toilets , the task presented his immune system defin@@ iti@@ vely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was just fine in his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his proof@@ ing showed an L@@ umin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison with this the L@@ umin@@ ometric number of fresh hands is less than 60 .
but there was a rus@@ sian toilet that he refused to stop after their L@@ umin@@ ometric count was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the bacterial score in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here , because it is inside a ec@@ el@@ ist here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through , that ended we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in healthy health will be a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the healthy health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed by the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , whom I have instructed to lick it , like the ek@@ els Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to put Ian to lick it , and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty del@@ ights on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents of lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally use products which included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a delay of £ 50,000 , because they had terror@@ ized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , the property recru@@ ited the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls of cl@@ oned holes , wooden legs were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family were moved and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation
Donna Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the apartment would not be able to repair any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of the walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the flat in the meantime , and the police said that the terror which the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ ir@@ ds , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ aks and flu@@ kes included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was set in June an arrangement for an isolated behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
they were traded in the property where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden legs are consumed .
neighbors said they had to fight on the road and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner these week viol@@ ently from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be volunte@@ ered .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors who said that her life was made to hell .
he said : &quot; they failed to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not staying there !
now , where they finally are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had to collabor@@ ate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed in regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the municipal house , tr@@ ash and old toys were cast down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see was administered to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to her family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step towards Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , the cour@@ ageous to us and have given us the information provided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that this development is con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that ant@@ ins@@ ulated behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ging on the ground .
workers in the in @-@ house management will now have rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house by and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ an@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was awarded a fine after she had found guilty of own@@ ing a drug B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was a vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were rewarded with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will del@@ ve the r@@ enter who do not keep to the assignment
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row told the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without deduc@@ tions , as well as to those who were damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate a criminal and ant@@ ins@@ ulated behavior that continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists close to Portugal , after a ti@@ eff@@ able military jet flying to the beach
sun@@ an@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3C Orion plane of air forces placed an incredible assault flight
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but persist@@ ed that there was no risk of security .
this was the moment , in which sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after a full @-@ flowing jet over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sun@@ beds at the Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach at Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
holi@@ day@@ makers jumped on , as they understand@@ ably started to make worry about the noise of the gl@@ aring @-@ drive , without seeing what caused by the clouds to them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ah added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the aircraft came from the dark and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces issued today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so deeply flies that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speaker said that the jet , because of the bad visibility , flew slightly deeper than usual , however , the air forces persist@@ ed that security at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland where four people came to death in Madeira .
today , the Portuguese air forces asked that the pilot had to fly on due to circumstances - strong ne@@ b@@ ula and bran@@ dr@@ as - as deep as its view was limited .
the plane was on a training flight when the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

Ma Long in a separate league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new tennis Olympic Champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; tit@@ le@@ holder &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
with this , the World Ranking List was awarded the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese result in a sign of the Five rings would result for the third time in a row .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they with@@ drew from the tri@@ b@@ une and left their shel@@ ters on a fair competition alone .
&quot; I &apos;ve played the matches here for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang tor@@ ger@@ ously said .
after the game , gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate , leaving Z@@ hang up only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma developed not the expected inter@@ ro@@ aring match .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ballo@@ ons to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the White E@@ tr@@ us@@ can , in his quarter @-@ final , against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was ad@@ di@@ cted to a raft or in a medical treatment , had to settle down with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become very similar to a high table tennis vintage .
Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amt &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states to have their majority .
the presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the past rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment in which the M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire usually reported as something concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the rep@@ ubli@@ can camp from the race , the doubts grow on his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media reports .
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for the rep@@ ubli@@ can .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor was carried out by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , to the same .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the state .
at risk , Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ ton , &quot; just as I did it before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and don &apos;t leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not make anything other than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
if it does not reach for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is threatened to rep@@ aint Gel@@ der to support his campaign , he should not present any better question .
instead , one wants to increase the Can@@ didate &apos;s candidates for the Congress stronger under arms .
Olympia : tri@@ cky fraud in D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a commission of discipline .
Ken@@ yan athl@@ ates threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ le@@ ach Olympic Games .
after a che@@ ating attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee was entitled to set up a commission of discipline to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had an Ur@@ ine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter rag , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team line Ken@@ ias from D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to make their own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal was handed and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls in the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red was about 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan missionary deleg@@ ates Michael Red I was sub@@ tra@@ cted from the Rio Olympics .
it should be informed against cash payments of his country about upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested by his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been following numerous D@@ oping rules for a longer time under special observation .
with the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 d@@ oping goals in front of the Rio games , previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight .
in front of summer games in Brazil , the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose D@@ oping fight conform with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports , ARD were always raised again that in Kenya d@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ ru@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und , recently called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed it in the Russian Athletics .
in this way , it could be proven that in this sport is nationwide and systematically combined .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare year the Salzburger Fest@@ spiele presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
featuring a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple of classical music and was fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ra@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that she is shaped very Latin .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this stage Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with sad@@ ness to her loving kindness with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is so clever , of course nai@@ vely , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his mot@@ ions , in his bli@@ ster , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joy@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s all very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ lic@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za SU@@ LT@@ ANA , one of three British school students who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ n@@ ime Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e told that her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .

SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years of age and died after her family after she had decided to leave the war of war and return to England .
&quot; we can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people will ever stop taking this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school@@ ma@@ ids rose from the east of London to a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
sult@@ anas &quot; family has been not@@ ified that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have been dra@@ fted to guarantee confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the sen@@ ator at the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the de@@ ceased judge Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to select Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he would not have spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he gam@@ bled .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ ton &apos;s team wouldn &apos;t care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the su@@ preme judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .

tre@@ ats wants to have n@@ ud@@ ing calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to extract a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief editor Steve Shaw told us early this year that his neck magazine from Old@@ school @-@ PLA@@ Y@@ BO@@ YS distingu@@ is@@ hable , as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude , at which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shaw said in a press release to the release of Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their images online or personally at the open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish town@@ ship reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not fit and agre@@ es to Erdogan , sits on packs of suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of safegu@@ ards to flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there might even be &quot; a hundred thousand &quot; , the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass curse to Germany .
&quot; in short , I mean tens of thousands of protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government has passed over Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with stra@@ ins , more than 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the abandoned put@@ sch , secular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks would like to add .
many will re@@ build in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who accepts even refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Minister of Services accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Alg@@ erian cities .
this means that Erdogan will increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were eradi@@ cated or displac@@ ed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
I feel no more safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition groups .
the fire mark@@ ers as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who adap@@ ts himself and to Erdogan , sits on packs of suit@@ cases , by the way , also the Kem@@ alists and secular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already reported the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
on June 30 , this would have been 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 percent of all recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , it is not valid for war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by state of state , individually pursued .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals gain nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to select the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country code will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as so far it does not work : summer break , heat and land battle thro@@ es - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the elections , are on vacation .
most tourists , which are in the country , on Use@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , are not allowed to choose the country tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays we distribute posters , infl@@ amed posters , distribute air balloon , distribute flyer and put out at the end of the vote , just strug@@ gling with difficulty .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the campaign very close by the people .
my hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
it is exciting , as strongly new@@ ing AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age , and has been head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , considering its large posters .
he travels through the land , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and ch@@ att@@ ing a little with the people , as it did already his legendary golden prec@@ ursor to Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and Chancellor Merkel bl@@ ends the debt of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of rec@@ op@@ o@@ ists , which is now likely to cost the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is , if you make the wrong time in the right place campaign .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel at great search for Chancellor Angela Merkel ; the German Parliament is in the north east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was also no one to anyone from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CDU will largely abst@@ ain from market conditions and shopping m@@ alls with um@@ bre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
that , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noted that , on the land , you have to crum@@ ble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are on the left hand , the SPD , the Green : in the wake of the country scar@@ c@@ ely present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU campaign against his fellow country@@ men is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go to where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ sal , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because as much stands on the game , Sell@@ ering has called for his SPD in a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Social Democrats were at least 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and only just before AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , can bring the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the vacation period and make their campaign great advantage over the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is called Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green poll@@ ut@@ ants go on ground search for local ab@@ rup@@ tions under the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even beautiful .
their impression : &quot; poll@@ ing holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants will suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is refurb@@ ished , there is nothing to complain about .
the construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end until at 20 o &apos;clock , there is all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty h@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
at the beginning of October , the building site was scheduled to be re@@ located to the South , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the opposite will also be praised to the construction of those who are responsible for the installation of dom@@ ination drives .
since the construction site passed on Monday to the south , and the lock of asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was cancelled and thus again the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Vice President Florian King for the rehabilitation department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , por@@ ridge and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many battles were looking for and rather tru@@ sting her nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what resulted in some of the truck in the areas of residential areas .
since the speed limit has not been observed , the community increased the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there was considerable over@@ ri@@ ots , &quot; says King , who made himself a position on the spot .
two to three per minute have been blind@@ ed .
the fastest car was on the way with 77 km / h in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved , however , it became qui@@ eter .
for business people at B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to watch in the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ restructuring has led to them on sales breaks , every one asks you to look through .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus for other companies , for whom the renovation hardly has consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also dre@@ amt that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most captured are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only it , but all the restaurants have hit hard . &quot;
it was missing the clients from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy to have turnover each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales figures apply to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street sei@@ z@@ ure of road &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threw his operation two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , gover@@ ning president Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation , the guest house benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B . now they also need the dis@@ advantages to carry out the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled .
in all ages , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pers@@ ist on .
after all , family business has been based here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
that other regul@@ ars may now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere nice .
that his regular basis returns to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 works on its client@@ ele for the largest crisis that has experienced its eating house in history .
construction has been done for six months , this is already brutal .
constantly scre@@ wed in the name of terrorism at laws .
after the latest proposals , the Minister of Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now sets a thick security package .
but what has a den@@ ial status with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of Defense during the launch of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are demanding no one .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also , I worship me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the Minister of the Interior was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within coalition and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère were given a little time , before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
a lot has been announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU standards for flight passengers and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities are not surprising as well .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère form a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under sentence and jihadists with double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grants the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still content this and don &apos;t need anything to do with the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas will present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
some of them are in themselves : he plans fast testing procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the arrest of people in front of deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees that are targeted specifically into the country will have to check in before their smartphones and dis@@ card social media accounts for a security examination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Dul@@ ces for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to provide some more worse than so far - such an off@@ ences or their papers deliber@@ ately throw away their identity to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them is politically and legally holy .
some still works un@@ question@@ able and let &apos;s ask questions .
and for some points - in the im@@ balances of patient - for example , the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were concerned about safety due to the high number of refugees .
and things , who deeply involved people , could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed out in electoral periods .
the inner security is foc@@ uss@@ ed enorm@@ ously in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
and yes , they stand for election fights .
Union and SPD focus on inner security therefore increasingly in position .
in the past few days , between the two parties , it went high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some of the Uni@@ ons &apos;s Interior Minister , in which the res@@ ent@@ ations also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ ile sound .
he &apos;s nothing from a revers@@ ed of the double pass .
we enjoyed the discussion in Germany .
you new to make , don &apos;t make sense .
and he had constitutional objec@@ tions to a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s quite a lot in what argument could make .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filing the subject of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel is sign@@ aled carefully to talk and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to increasing the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen still comes to an assist .
despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
at the recall reaction , there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can lead to a plus , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW awak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and st@@ amped the total sales of the company , as stated in the Da@@ x .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany the deliveries increased by almost a sixth .
brands partner Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , it has given a purchase order back in several core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was deb@@ ited to the exit from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the U.S. where the emissions were initially escal@@ ated , a minus sign is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected house brand of Lower Saxony is continuing to assist by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 % to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles has been held .
group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler led a sales plan from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period , around 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW invites about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW , that the remo@@ del@@ ing of the cars has no negative effects .
after upgra@@ ding the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station asked the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t talk about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was named on Friday in corporate history . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ eries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports its German customers now a guarantee of fully @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
from the Public Ministry of Transport , this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that the fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine capacity after upgra@@ ding , will take no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in corporate history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen offers the possibility that customers come for instance a half year after upgra@@ ding to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest it is important to avoid that in case of any possible damages that have nothing to do with the waste sc@@ andal , to for@@ ce@@ fully guarantees the warranty conditions as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why I use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich austerity @-@ based prisoners - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note Head , Josef Paul stated on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on tox@@ ic@@ - or daily budgets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of a single incident and does not see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal Spar@@ kli@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ row penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks pay money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September from Privat@@ e- and corporate clients for deposits over € 100,000 on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily financial accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next € 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ski@@ pped 40 million euros for a long time , which could be lifted off from one day to the other , which he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and causing a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for any million € . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now on after the caus@@ al principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ins , I &apos;m not like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the banking officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients have had understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational sustainable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burg land had made head@@ lines with its Skat@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay private customers to pay for deposits , along with banks and savings banks are much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff which is slightly larger from the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the co@@ operative G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate a storage rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ ban@@ ken and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going to neg@@ atives towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and he threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in width .
destination records : who is buying records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before applying for comm@@ ent@@ ations to over@@ sow@@ ed him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ def@@ ensive men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most controversial re @-@ emergence of records are not shown on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to greet the curiosity of physical objects , but for mid @-@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record , all pre@@ views are between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog was to be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I carry on a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a humble gray suit before I steal , my hands hold and somewhat determin@@ ing as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s look at a closer look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent seller were based , there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman , to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data number : eight men of middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have ca . 3000 or 4000 records .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me a snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy panels , which he could not afford to buy records when they had been released and sold again when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are released from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s , which was released when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend his own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers , which he meets , meet the You@@ go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations which I have led , people normally have emp@@ tied up their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs will now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offers a cal@@ ming community of equal ties .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to turn back to stability of trusted sound@@ tracks , w@@ aking up from things to w@@ aking lucky jewelry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of materials poss@@ essions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is as collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee from a flat stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this point of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I bl@@ ush through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy effect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone first came down here and said : &quot; I have no turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I can put them to the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound of the sound almost a whole floor , has an entertaining audience than I pur@@ ify .
there are couples over 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women of central age .
even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ pack@@ et pop instead of experimental jazz is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to imagine if you stand for about 30 seconds .
El@@ ot@@ ub@@ a , 27 , runs around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale .
it rather makes a shop bum@@ ble@@ bee as a bulk purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of records &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; she drives with a dis@@ loved sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the appearance of je@@ ans Hot@@ as , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager who group to group about Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter proves to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see it - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to gras@@ p them .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ around . &quot;
but considering the fact that every attraction for these objects may mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of So@@ il could be for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also that is the most for luxury objects like plates .
although my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they let at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record labels that exist in reality , stores and On@@ line@@ research .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they star@@ red by a sin@@ ister , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator that rises above the shoulders of middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities argue in Cal@@ ais that the state should be able to break down 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing shops , in which people sell inside the camp goods , selling cigarettes to energy drinks , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euro in provisional restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups are not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who were able to operate the 72 pro@@ vision@@ ist transactions , but cleared that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were absolutely in@@ comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ ge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much greater role than people living in extreme pre@@ ventive conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer tran@@ quil hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as an advice to asylum issues for hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants inv@@ ests on Friday that the number of refugees increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games while playing , but also interv@@ ene .
for example , they can give up players missions and oppos@@ e enemies and supply other equipment items .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s r@@ attle has to adjust to the next generation speed sensor : in several federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should over@@ lead tem@@ pos@@ thier especially effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accident points , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or refurb@@ ishing bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary Bl@@ ater for respec@@ ting the speed limit .
a durable , mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days , the case data are encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit as well as flow rate after time , vehicle strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with trailer h@@ itch .
so that it is not simply th@@ ron@@ aut , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way van@@ ish the safe outer hull .
a built @-@ in alarm system should also protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used for data from Vit@@ ronic in several federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities are also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold .
UK &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro stage in Rio .
in Fiji , a master class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , press back , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color .
the defeat was failed by the non @-@ poor con@@ sol@@ ation of silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall on them in the finals .
but regardless of this , Fiji had struck a 15 @-@ man team in top form in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not be that at least one gold medal is a gold medal to hang on his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England at Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind itself .
eight years ago , they lost Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sl@@ ack is hurt , but progress is astonishing .
Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of having fun .
it felt right for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if you run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au entered the corner .
with another four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another assault from the right corner he turned around .
scar@@ c@@ ely 12 @-@ 0 and GB scar@@ c@@ ely appe@@ aled the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ able t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a entered a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new record since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ judi@@ ced by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s so , as I was born in Fiji to play the 7 while still lear@@ nt .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant mid@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South @-@ se@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags swings and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the i dot dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff finds , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and k@@ ick@@ le cr@@ ushing defeat in the grass .
earlier on the day in Fiji had conquered Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain th@@ ron@@ ged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half , but Dan N@@ orton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling von Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ member teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning from fighting with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
there will be no engine in@@ al@@ eres of gold as with these games and that will mean what hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was there for the second Olympics in a row without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who put on a scale of such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ super@@ imposed deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete that reflect on the surface with the elegance of tears , which does not reflect the way of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Arch .
behind every gold in rowing there is a bat@@ a@@ illon on the willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the trainer , who wouldn &apos;t know that day would survive if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start out what the inter@@ ruption was at a minimum , if that &apos;s the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go better soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough .
so it begins .
the rowing on itself is a challenge , but this makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ asi@@ bility of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ving morning so spent a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning who as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent was in use in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that might be something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how many things I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person to train@@ ee or wish a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very tra@@ pped in the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wa@@ it in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time , we weren &apos;t looking forward to making something rab@@ ies .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV Adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
this would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
( 31 years ) exemplary for clarity .
the executive director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far . &quot;
a small cab@@ inets is the model for the great water producers .
so it was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution to the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water@@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia donated the twin association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ clu@@ ded &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , which was 31 years in the Pur@@ pose association , 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supplies for further cities and con@@ greg@@ ations .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor &apos;s Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as water @-@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the twin association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its duties have been very diverse and they pl@@ ush from water management and maintenance activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land premises in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of a central computer controller ( 1999 ) and the new generation of water pipes ( 2004 ) .
I have given no breast@@ feeding and made new innovations again , because water is dam@@ aging and drinking water the most important food .
in its lu@@ d@@ atio they lob@@ ster mer@@ cen@@ ary faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart of heart for his water purpose and he had lived for the water purpose , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real pract@@ ition@@ ers , he gave the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe to nit@@ rate of nit@@ rate in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ken district .
he received so much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller with his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a loyal .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he distinguished the fountain and restructuring of the twin association .
the biggest challenge , and the most difficult use , however , were the grave at the grave on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sn@@ ug@@ gles .
the management of the drinking water @-@ bearing association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who enters the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself in us and indicated to have shot his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said a police leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him I was publicly ra@@ yed .
meanwhile , since Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1,80 m tall , muscular , brown and has a smo@@ g .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a smo@@ g .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon for themselves , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. is going to call the 110 .
the police talks about an &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information about the ather@@ less or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more at this moment , &quot; said a police officer in Lübeck .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in a million@@ th height .
financial burden caused by the industry from the oil production , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there remain in the liberation of renewable energy revolution in the inventory of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West German Social Paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we finally could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to deplo@@ y the steel manufacturer , the gases made from the stove to electricity generation for their own consumption , to make money .
according to the German industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission in talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators will be replaced in the steel works , all an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the European Commission to make its own energy production .
thus the status quo of the current regulation will largely be fixed .
special meaning have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment goals are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under surplus capacities and a substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation began more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw a massive steel market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing chin@@ ese steel companies price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation rela@@ xes something relaxed .
the import duties on imp@@ acted steel effect , to the others the economic prospects in China have risen up in China .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
recently the prices were stag@@ nat@@ ing .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , some 8@@ 6000 people were employed by the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less crude steel compared with 3.4 million tonnes , as in the previous year , as the economic unification of steel held on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the set number now went back to the second month in a row .
production has been raised by two percent since the beginning of the year .
the association assi@@ sts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing doing sen@@ iors well
Sing@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : she was in the choir &apos;s choir as a young girl , in his teacher &apos;s studies , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a ch@@ id@@ l@@ ren choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and spirit .
for singing is also a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the German senior League .
most sen@@ iors singing in chorus and sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ackl@@ er .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can build and maintain social contacts .
for often they solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ar@@ du@@ ous in the positive sense , the h@@ ic@@ er means .
by doing so , pension@@ ers exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who require the lungs regularly calls for everyday life , not so quickly from the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
to elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labour community of sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz is frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs by older people w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song tex@@ tured and especially tunes , human beings per@@ sever@@ ed themselves in long covered events .
in singing , a special performance is required by singing , L@@ enz explains .
simultaneously focusing on his own voice and to a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practice not only to focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the acknowle@@ d@@ gement that one lear@@ ns through singing in chorus , h@@ ic@@ er means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in chorus .
to show themselves : if I am long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , it should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent , L@@ enz suggests .
you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is already listening to sound ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
if someone comes from the circle of people in an old ench@@ y@@ ench@@ y@@ ma , you can easily join .
many cities also offer views on cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church officers .
many veter@@ an cho@@ irs can be found also on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research .
who wants to sing , should be able to join a choir says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sing well the soul well and has something bad - that applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect has the calls of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also didn &apos;t let the males get cold , however , they were always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the path@@ ogen of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on mi@@ ths of the little ones .
they respond ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ ittens , who are in big trouble as scientists from the veter@@ inary College and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
tom@@ cat also react to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently , the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly ruled young for the males either non @-@ perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Ho@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens scre@@ amed with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult male and eight female patients were observed from the MH@@ H .
they were played for a small calling of small ones , which were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger reg@@ ained k@@ ittens , which were lifted in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who still haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
she swi@@ vel faster for the speaker , when this calls to the very reg@@ ained k@@ ittens .
this ability may possibly be born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
some studies also showed that women react sensitive to su@@ ck@@ ling , whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ bed with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place an important football game .
prior to the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
in July , after the withdrawal of the exceptional test after the crash test in July , the government , which will not be imp@@ aired by normal vou@@ chers should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football is also not stopped .
the pro@@ secutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r .
thus , the South America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ ch@@ r should be accused of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is made responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
although it is valid for 90 days , the state of emergency was still valid until October , in fact , however , this has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Erdogan &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sports is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Earth .
especially fans of the club clubs Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count to the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of Turks did in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
the fans can even agree - no matter if their heart beats to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; there will be back again to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporty value in the past season has been proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has ended its first season as a top@@ sc@@ orer of its association .
in the final match against fen@@ id@@ ah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his crew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master took an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round box in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; and the Europa League go early .
in the south of Li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the game year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis of the 14th title with 26 season @-@ season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sel@@ ector .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return on the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the AC Florence , the AC Florence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bor@@ rowed an bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after putting the political situation in the country , had not returned to his EM @-@ vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario is trying to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have to be willing to give rise to some one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ inity to 7.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have yet medals chance at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa cannot start in Rio .
others listed athle@@ tics sinners can laugh about it - they are strug@@ gling in Rio to medals .
the D@@ oping theme determines the head@@ lines for the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock her start was shortly before the play , was le@@ ased out and hat@@ ched at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a set @-@ up sm@@ iles , she had stum@@ bled in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as a fixed point , she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a storm .
but there are still numerous sport@@ s@@ men who go to the Rio despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was closed for two times due to d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ Champion even runs faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m and is considered the biggest challenge of U@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fraser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to be se@@ ated in 2010 after receiving the pain in oxy@@ co@@ don .
after having had heavy to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , she defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships were tested positively by the banned ab@@ ul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane .
Per@@ kovic was ex@@ iting the in@@ gest@@ ion and was blocked for six months .
the four broad@@ est throws in this year go to the account of great gold fav@@ ors .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , be@@ eu@@ ated Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres , the fastest man in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been subsequently detected as many medals .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 , nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ oping and EM @-@ Tit@@ le for testosterone deficiency .
he also received the 2008 Olympic Games debut as a bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the ranking list .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , critics were found on taking a combined dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA decreased , and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian musician injured - Sever@@ al dead dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday soon .
she had suffered ker@@ chie@@ fs and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
they planned their home journey to early September .
whether of further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so fr@@ ill .
at some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded in a two bom@@ bers last Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman killed and killed approximately 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday soon two Spr@@ eng@@ ths went high , and another person was killed by the authorities .
also Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the early stage bomb explosion .
near the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban formation .
the explo@@ sives was put into the air according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et in front of the Re@@ vier of Co@@ ast@@ al police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the Southeast Coast have several injured .
one link to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ates carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee on Friday early journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s too early to speak to possible mot@@ if@@ s - it is probably the action of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks in relation to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a local sab@@ otage that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is thought that bombs were laid by enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have been sec@@ rec@@ y in recent days to receive information on imp@@ ending suggestions in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks .
the police force their officers in the whole country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed toward tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of reason the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to suit the instructions of Thai security agencies .
high risk of safety ( security level 3 ) was used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to disputes between safety and Muslim populations , there is no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
higher risk of safety ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars the military big influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to initi@@ ate chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , keeps himself too good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip for years in the extreme south of the country &apos;s crum@@ bling rebellion .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just one year ago , in Bangkok , in an attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ities Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several provincial authorities , the Constitu@@ tional Prot@@ ector has also made the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ities Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the executive director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ did ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic belief or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ used in a extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; ident@@ ities Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it revol@@ ves against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; loss of their own identity by alien . &quot;
the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; are already shown in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia .
Ma@@ did said that his authority were closely matched with the decision in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; the Constitu@@ tional Protection Act said .
generally speaking , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists are as right as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is no ad@@ orable advertising for his own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are pr@@ one to sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special manner .
this is dangerous .
finally , several federal states have given reports on the contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ did said that he did not have any insights .
for the un@@ constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , AF@@ D - is due to certain individuals that are extrem@@ ist , its objective and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , whether such people have the impact on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the substantial increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee meetings , Ma@@ did he wouldn &apos;t talk of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years , we noted that it can be legitim@@ ate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite obvious that further legitim@@ ate groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other far @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
a clear or across Europe @-@ wide control of rec@@ tan@@ gles is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on regional level or social networks .
worried , Ma@@ did talk about that many en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ect attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have previously been not known as criminal , politically motivated off@@ ender or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes committed with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted by the CDU , SPD or Left , who then radic@@ ally radic@@ alised by far @-@ right reform@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records the head@@ lines during the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performances of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures anymore .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the clip was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his race with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place from 59 .
but it was rather not a sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old did not participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was entitled to a special start from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swim in sub@@ merged countries .
because in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ien most athletes run , Hab@@ it simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap fast .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i received the run for media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of freedom .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim for eight months before Olympic and had never had a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping choice not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on a vic@@ torious event in Florida .
if the election has nothing to become US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then drive to the holiday .
Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be quite no matter : &quot; ultimately it will be either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in an telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC .
if it does not reach for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in its party , more and more resistance were formed .
post climb@@ s in Commerce with Elec@@ tro Transport

the interest of other firms on the car is obviously large .
the post is planning to sell your electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
shortly , the company aims to launch trade with the transporter .
the post will also offer its electric tran@@ sports from the next year on the free car market .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in late July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will complete the entire fleet .

Gf@@ K @-@ Gui@@ ding steps after dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchange his boss Matthias Hartmann .
the back@@ lash arrived suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of board manager Matthias Hartmann is even more uncertain , the longer the success of his promised successes .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nürn@@ berger market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resign@@ ation of corporate management is the world &apos;s number five in front of a person@@ alised new start .
Gf@@ K board leader wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Arno Mahl@@ ert has already been exp@@ elled from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Executive Board already over@@ take the previous board member of Gerhard Haus@@ ehr@@ inger on September 1 , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor was found for Hartmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the back@@ lash the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mr. Hartmann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , is not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures every shareholder at some point will be un@@ steady .
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , it would do the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; it was .

accidents - Bus sli@@ pped in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ lin in dit@@ ch : eight injured
during an accident of a tour of 43 sen@@ iors , on Thursday evening in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ lin ( district of Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , the police divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old travel owner of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to sof@@ ten their information according to an oppos@@ ing truck which drove partly on the travel track .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokesperson for the police , Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
a six ambul@@ ance cars and a passenger car came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the most recent trav@@ ellers were brought back from a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ lin district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators asked the truck and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre water amount to € 3.@@ 44 as of October 1 , 2016 for the area of waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ berg / L@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the A@@ zo@@ endorf plant , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again if appropriate improvements are needed .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser reported ( CS@@ U ) , it has been noted for the approval of the household by Land@@ rats . Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that wast@@ e@@ water facilities run shel@@ ters .
because of legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf is obliged to maintain the facilities free of charge .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial drives from Wel@@ cho@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to push deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rise increases between 48 and 67 percent .
according to the executive director Herbert Schmidt encountered the panel , a new calculation of the charges for wast@@ e@@ water treatment was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - and sub@@ covers from the previous year period will be compens@@ ated .
thus , Schmidt determined that in all three wast@@ e@@ water facilities , Schmidt established itself relatively small facilities with a very low wage fall , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
so , due to the low mani@@ pulation situation , for example expenses for the needed repair of several thousand euros would be engraved .
in addition , wast@@ e@@ water wast@@ es slightly in all three plants .
furthermore , in the past cal@@ orie period , in all three plants , not least due to their age , rehabilitation and repair expenses have fallen in a considerable amount .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world qu@@ arri@@ es , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp , almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that in the wast@@ e@@ water system Az@@ endorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .
after almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by the world , and in the pond ke@@ ep@@ ran@@ ce L@@ p had to be operated after almost 20 years of operation , the sep@@ tic cre@@ st dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation possibility can be installed in order to comply with the water requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res come to these extraordinary expenses and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still evident at the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses clearly made that in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Schmidt determined the market share of great entertainment costs for wast@@ e@@ water facilities in the past 20 years .
the situation for the so @-@ called systems will continue to stay in the view of stone buildings in the duration of duration , since it could not be extended by the supply of se@@ wer@@ age , Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to these systems , because it is about de@@ preci@@ ation facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as an Asian caric@@ ature Associated theory
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat around 150 million daily ups to change reality and play with ident@@ ities as such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
they can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog , or a piece that could be painted by Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are bl@@ am@@ aged , stand@@ ar@@ dised tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ enium per day .
all wron@@ g@@ ations arrive to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat @-@ Filter has drawn cr@@ iti@@ que to himself in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin as a beauty ideal would propag@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week had proposed a filter , which gave them Schl@@ itz@@ au@@ gen , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , called it some critics a ra@@ cial caric@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y on a bigger problem referred to the company with diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to An@@ ime characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced ra@@ cial sm@@ iles , the filter re@@ minded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et became widespread over the photos , that the filter was hur@@ tful and m@@ ild@@ ly said un@@ comfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to argue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not gro@@ unded , but that the yellow layer was pulled down to the ab@@ ir@@ ate extre@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ ke .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration process , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats Big crowds of young people - who are in the race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ s - could rather be expected to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of snap@@ shots felt a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and urged others to do the same .
in a no@@ zzle for medium and in a phone interview she said they believe that r@@ ass@@ en@@ related contro@@ vers@@ y has a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and ended their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either do they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they have made such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat left un@@ answered .
the company publishes no figures for diversity of its workforce and exhibits its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a speaking , the company recently hired a staff responsible , which focused on under@@ lining population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users as we need to say that the O.@@ K. is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military control fal@@ sely ISIS Secret service Information , introduces Committee of Congress
military officers of the United States Central Command changed customer service information to draw a optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states on site would have been allowed to report a report on Thursday in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the rep@@ ubli@@ can members of the Armed Forces of the Dis@@ satisfaction , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Staff analy@@ st , reported how su@@ peri@@ ors changed their inv@@ alu@@ ation in the struggle against the Islamic state .
the Central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News service information , which have been taken off by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander in a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states to be on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com are unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cent@@ Com leaders are up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct references to change government posts under Obama , it shows how analy@@ st exposed the pressure from their laws , a optimistic image from the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 there were many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from the congress clearly positive than it represents the facts . &quot;
for example , an Cent@@ Com has publicly known that military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ lem already could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the post @-@ law reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them had been played that analysts were concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the chief inspec@@ torate of the Defense Department .
the company &apos;s democratic members published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a revised process for the creation of subsequent assess@@ ments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest ranking Advisory Council in the Com@@ intern , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of retro@@ spective reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats failed to have found evidence of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ative investigations into the Pentagon , following complaints by Cent@@ Com .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress , while investig@@ ating the General Inspec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes really appreciate the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have returned the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able inv@@ alu@@ able military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , when an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st sum@@ med up only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq , and a little time on insist@@ ent on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ kers asks for specif@@ ying government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government held by the Islamic State , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had taken , since these provisional refin@@ eries had been put into service in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the Legisl@@ ative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. win the fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie drew B@@ am also the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually display a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they can &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , they know : the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group .
the first placed will go the strong Dutch slightly longer , which will lead the other group .
as always the game may end on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising verteb@@ ra@@ e in their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in their hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player from the USA , the youngest in the team &apos;s history .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig was called Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work place in London which we have now .
we can handle the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was gone without victory in the game , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and kept the pitch of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and emp@@ tied the ball in the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and ev@@ asive , a fast relay between competition and quest .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a paper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s queu@@ e in the coffee shop without hearing without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s du@@ n with dimples , could have been thoroughly sent under this known name , which would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even barrels .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it last for a long time .
but if I do not make good arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although an Olympic event has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so spar@@ sely perceived that many people I asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympic port .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the U.S. athl@@ ete for competition , it has never won a medal in the tram@@ way jumping and had won an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has some outer nature char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ en@@ lighten@@ ed ear than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert but only a true enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ously potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending sp@@ ool - but also the gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports , which combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; jumping board . &quot;
rising winner jumping on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and must land a row of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , hed@@ gehog and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are assessed according to the official Olympi@@ ad programme , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further in their quest to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the end , sometimes and back , up and down , down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but in the TV broadcast also another polite objective : the world or the Olympic lord .
the goal @-@ directed stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir an audience to tears .
but it is also what I think even when looking for these games as a little .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ one , seem@@ ingly he@@ el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes to the top , then down again , then effort@@ lessly back to the top .
again there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as strong as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the quali@@ fications and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of a after@@ no@@ ons of two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will probably survive in general tum@@ ult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ loc@@ us and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan@@ base to the air of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a member of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that sixty protests were killed during clas@@ hes with police in the police .
is Ethiopia just collapse ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid part of West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and spread themselves in more areas .
last week , thousands of people invaded the streets and the fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less , according to human rights organizations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen cru@@ sted to un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
the videos of the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sho@@ cks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a previous study .
&quot; it was always difficult to stick this country and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are closely associated with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
the infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually calm , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to supp@@ ress the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent into prison , driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest@@ ing it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous dis@@ comforts , which cover everything from ground work to the saus@@ ages in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions rise along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts predi@@ ct that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced to use more or less forces in recent years , and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of del@@ im@@ ation after years ago H@@ ink@@ uck@@ les under the surface can now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government bul@@ ls access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , so many people can still communicate about internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide it , where they may stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they were gathered together to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Ä@@ es@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s mainly Christian high countries , in politics and the economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos of which many Muslims are living and living in flat land areas .
but this is just changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and the military , in the secret services , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ public illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly sensitive to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and to use special officers to edit opponents , and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region north of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed according to analy@@ tics , and were subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ os many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leader in their visionary infrastructure plans , such as the new Pend@@ ul@@ um Act , as well as for their measur@@ able adv@@ ances in poverty .
but apparently this does not hin@@ der the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts predi@@ ct that protests and other Western allies are in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dating flights beyond the neighboring Somalia , even when she recently told that she closed the base .
as the West will clearly support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his associate in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ gh@@ trop@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign says that his repeatedly claimed claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the &quot; founder of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this asser@@ tion raises new questions about the can@@ did@@ acy of the S@@ rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate and communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fellow country@@ men who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase , in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position of declar@@ ing statements , which he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had made a referendum on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump taken back in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insist@@ ed on interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to we@@ aken his statement by causing him to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS would not want to know about the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism rolled down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand for the economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es to the situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought up sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
in late July he moved up strong criticism , when he said that the Russians should have Mrs. Clin@@ tons of mails , but he later explained &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then turn back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages can be taken from his fans , as they arrive , and then , &quot; if necessary &quot; , &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication agent who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an ear @-@ whose tone , because his circum@@ stance has declined .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he accused his critics often to dist@@ ort his testimony or his humour wrong .
but while he is stepp@@ ing up in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump joke having brought his loyal fellow country@@ men to his un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent inter@@ respon@@ dents , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was question@@ ed if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it &apos;s true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization that he called her back@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely false , and so it was because he pulled out the troops from Iraq .
most mainst@@ ream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as the State Minister in which Mrs. Clinton had been allowed to spread out ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and he cast them up on each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats failed to say Mr. Tr@@ umps sorry for just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once over the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ am@@ big@@ uous café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years of good coffee .
of course the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ der front was pushed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , designed in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new .
a re @-@ animated cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and the manager of the new café .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a money to provide money for a new shell , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lights out of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are natur@@ ism bowls .
the café is no longer served , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ owed current of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also urged by Prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee table , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on my coffee and in the ver@@ b that liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she gave a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and rendered inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came back after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he did not know a ro@@ ar that the soap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie began to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee @-@ packed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , that he fore@@ told them to soon make his new neighbours back .
the location also has additional advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell cold coffee in the cold .
there is a chance that the Café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new version is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the cafe was closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt told us that the location of Lok@@ als and the best felt a new coffee .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt was a Fai@@ thful for a refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ ou@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with foreign people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ it last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was negoti@@ ated by Chinese cuisine in the USA while T@@ une told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ ky snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Z@@ bri@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the reporter smoked Hack@@ sau@@ lt , this was the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the Great Depression .
&quot; abundant food was very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ e gr@@ inn@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put on the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were Americans that sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the paths with which the country went on to be no longer the lar@@ aff@@ enland to be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se , the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ z was : mysterious foods such as loaves and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ ites became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ al as &quot; wonderful style , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noticed that it could hide in@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients below a mu@@ d@@ dy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , has become a very rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures were tried out as having a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction to taste or even heal@@ thful food .
while her research for the book , which includes recipes , prepared a dish made of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on a mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since , bud@@ get@@ ary economic govern@@ ors - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Ac@@ count@@ Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country so nicely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by rele@@ asing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; households to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge , P@@ amp@@ e as creamy aghetti with carrots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmers in his kitchen , he travelled like the one million@@ th man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked the continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ filled dining room and bearing a smo@@ king .
he was a marvellous kind of real@@ time .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to st@@ ain with his stomach .
as described in the book , today &apos;s hired household , with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Roosevelt , the White House brought out the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most famous food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded once the land came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , the bri@@ ck@@ ering , as well as science has been applied to food@@ stu@@ ffs .
the couple gave better understood the eating habits of the brick @-@ in @-@ law at the writing of the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
the bri@@ ck@@ yard rec@@ alled : &quot; they really made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind off .
after the plates had been evacu@@ ated with Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew up a dessert which they had made home : the pl@@ um of Roosevelt was taking lunch for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ une and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each appeared a little re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spoon to the fence , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly it was not bad .
Co@@ e repeated three times a beat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed on bombs : he was the Ale@@ ppo hero
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died during a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil control group that has been saved to life as far as 60,000 people so far .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers set their own life to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a babies from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbol in horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes have never seen himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter have four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , a chlorine gas was filled with chlor@@ o@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he gets on average just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal on sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle , however , appears to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness &quot; is commenting on the Max Planck Institute of demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist assumed long that Greenland shar@@ ks become stone .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to watch , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they appear mostly only in winter .
researchers have little to know about the lifestyle of the Greenland shar@@ ks .
their time lu@@ pin ben@@ ds , as they took six animals in front of val@@ bard , with a broad@@ c@@ aster .
prey this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ ers at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ aver producing from higher water layers into down@@ stream .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch of the North Atlantic Ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timet@@ re measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the shar@@ k of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lashes already occurs before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are not restored in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth was therefore , after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try to reduce large amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the lens also contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its study in 2012 .
in its len@@ tic@@ le , all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters might be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign a age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably at the threshold of the sexually mature stood and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks became apparent at least one and a half centuries .
this also might be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane le@@ es live primarily in icy waters , is not a co@@ incidence .
the present record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bacon was damaged a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the living animals living there are frequently living animals of the animals living there .
so they ri@@ cher later - and then slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal is heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on taking as many descendants early as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist sc@@ rub@@ bing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should always invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics related to building , the municipal council deals primarily in the most recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee of mayor Robert P@@ utz assumed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported resi@@ den@@ ies can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ er@@ ation and closure requests can be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction phase 1 ) is no longer in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the council is convinced that the weak@@ nesses in the rural and quiet living community beauti@@ es young families and sen@@ iors alike .
as it was called , Bau@@ te can immediately sign up in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to be cons@@ ulted in its September session .
in order to res@@ ett@@ lement further commercial companies , linked to the creation of jobs , the council decided to re@@ sign the area of area planned for the spring of this year in spring of this year .
in the sub@@ tim@@ est@@ ead there is already proven industrial area around two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
thus , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the City of Main boasts the best chances of creating jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain how funds continue to operate further from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport , the approval in the UK so far .
this just utili@@ ze major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , speaking of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone unite , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Con@@ ditions E@@ IO@@ PA and Risk ES@@ R@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of Luxembourg , Luxembourg is home to a large fund , cutting off as well as Dublin in infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further , the city with easily available commercial premises .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition to the Seine , prices for top @-@ class commercial premises are around 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .

a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which you created from the hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday , that resulted in the presidential candidate of demo@@ cra@@ t and their husband &apos;s income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons $ 1 million donated to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had sales of nearly USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries . the former Foreign Minister granted an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax return in the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced today &apos;s fight in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a way , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ als behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ draw their tax returns in relation to his previous promises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common to publish their tax returns for US presidential candidates , although they are not obliged to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to verify a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Advisor to CNN , said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to make a difference before tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , including rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already re@@ lied that his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business meetings , and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which senior rep@@ ublic@@ ans re@@ iter@@ ate his tax return .
on Thursday she talked about the subject , even during a speech in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done for the past decades and to publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisor and tax advis@@ ers , indic@@ ating that it could still be the case .
they have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose headquarters took H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate , put his seat on a meeting to share their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he had been subjected to a control test of the IRS and didn &apos;t have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most of the Americans .
its main investment fund was an inexpensive In@@ dex@@ fonds , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

con@@ doms with C@@ hili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ craft : promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants
nature Prot@@ ects in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to stop eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by settlers - they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with ch@@ illi .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ ron Foundation , which had already been an idea for years ago , intensi@@ fied its support in the country in the north of Tanzania , a non@@ violent four@@ fold method to protect their homes and harvest@@ ing without being inj@@ ected .
before that , many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is the world phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in this con@@ greg@@ ations , with many more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields , without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps are illumin@@ ating the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and bli@@ sters in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not sc@@ ared , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hili@@ c &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ hili@@ pu@@ der mixed with Earth is packed together with a fire@@ work fighter in a con@@ dom , which ends up to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom cl@@ ends with a pop and spray fine dust of ch@@ ili powder into the air .
as a rule , a hint that rule out to ch@@ ase the eleph@@ ants .
one last option is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a golf fire in the air and caused a loud , light explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director crum@@ bles Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media release after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin because it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shoah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his troubles at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries who can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel through its own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he got there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ ck@@ led him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel mentioned that the intervention was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvious decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it stood still more anger , dissolved in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the employee was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and app@@ alled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has taken up in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a major dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident broke out a pretty big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some enter@@ tained the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged evidence of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was pointed out in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel located at the no@@ bility of the Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all the accus@@ ations and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , tells the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; not to record Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police re@@ counts Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , together with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reform of the government for the public educational system .
the police arrested Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to explore the students , what led to the police , rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as set up .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their confusion about the plans .
according to the Government &apos;s proposals in Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the protest@@ ers saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against temporary president Michel T@@ emer to walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises to 71 % on - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade set between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , the further trade building is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was reached by supplies of aircraft , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign trade show raised about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you could say that the record numbers Iranian tourists are broken in Russia from last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can visit the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

together four stages were merged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ wall@@ journey in the past two years , the Chief Financial Officer of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several pilgri@@ m destinations were examined and we decided to be a special pilgrimage to the Bishop of Mer@@ cy in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with an open pilgrimage in Freiburg on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .

sh@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home when Br@@ ite Gold is used for cycling .
Scottish team called Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the Män@@ ner@@ team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he took the legend and stor@@ med the legend to visit a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympic medals .
it repeated the trick , after they took place in London in March , despite the back@@ log of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when Hin@@ ds appeared .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ re a gap to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed as they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - which was four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ord , but at the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders wins the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was close to his lap , but Kenn@@ y took the team up and Sk@@ inner stopped .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , during which the execution in a higher speed drove to slow him down and to enable it to keep pace and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell off Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than these rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there were Hin@@ ds that he inten@@ tionally fell down on the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no claim from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
so this time there was no such a problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have been so badly sha@@ ken with so many sur@@ titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he is repe@@ ating Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a very sacred date for the British Sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal .
the would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition in the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , who won gold in London 2012 , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round trip ( 22.@@ 42 ) takes place on the second day of the Race wers , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety in the focus .
he had fought with Be@@ ams before the qualification , when officials called for him to measure his height .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is looking forward to his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a donation to medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio had been shut down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid@@ st sex and bul@@ lying pen@@ alties as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , when one sees itself the first evening of competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary GB@@ s , who has reached the perfect moment to repeat his climax again .
serving the future of melt from Portland due to the abol@@ ition of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , because the system operator will den@@ ounce the energy supply agreement and thus ensure all delivery contracts , as the supply of energy companies is divided .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to run the facility .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa Farm plant in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs direct as well as indirect - might be at risk at a closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt works around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point of Henry melt , which led last year to an closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland lost money and ris@@ ked a shut@@ down .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last@@ ly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three other owners are den@@ ounced their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p can hold smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L will assume that the plant in Portland is still operated , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the company divided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the Tre@@ aties for so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month termination period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on AG@@ L on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts for high @-@ commercial electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared that it had already written down the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book contracts based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; does not affect the melting of melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a declaration , why it has been re@@ signed by the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to analysts from the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is able to consume about 600 mega@@ watts each year and it will consume about 900 mega@@ watts .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , which is on the cover of the bird edition of the Vog@@ ue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ger and Mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Kris is on the cover of the legendary September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people that I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said San Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem ) Rob Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as in the presence of the popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ es and Produc@@ er of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all have a surprise party .
this portra@@ ys the c@@ lich@@ é action almost every birthday player ( Se@@ ac@@ rest assured the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Kris had to leave her other girl somehow at this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim likes it , you and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 , but the cover of September issue is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a gir@@ th , which rather resembles a picture book as a fashion journal , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut fashi@@ on@@ ista used by the 8@@ 32 pages of the ball 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating that during the last two years , pictures of the journal are still sick@@ ening in front of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities that Model@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs J@@ enner is described as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people or in reality stars or young people of today , who know how to talk a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
obviously J@@ enn@@ ese success doesn &apos;t like every success .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues called Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called it &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook high again when the news came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but wander@@ ing on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to be passing by the point .
Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the bird edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes ads for your Grun@@ dig by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her handmade pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the journal LOVE .
and in their spare time she is visible in the reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers annually indicate 16@@ 0,000 people per year .
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the needs of the country are rati@@ fied by the municipal centers each year , while the industry accounts for the effects of further short@@ cuts on the already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need @-@ needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ u@@ ys and similar , were rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal services .
legal services of the assembly , which are already fully trained , are ready for further reductions .
as of June , next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its agents .
the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation without abol@@ ition of the Federal Government would only be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically funded , which means that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sible and impressive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have odd problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Queens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice and the sen@@ ators from Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis make up these short@@ cuts immediately so the people need help they need to get legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raising funds for legal aid on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the municipal centres and its customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been indicted for an alleged in@@ action when you told her campaign manager for North Carolina in February a fire@@ arm for a employee when they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a indictment which was filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ amb@@ i had been waiting for many months , that the matter would be controlled internally , before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to establish damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ amb@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment took only two days after the rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , when he said of a crowd in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; and arms lovers should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the gover@@ ning party of the SPD and the CDU continue .
this revealed representative surveys of the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin .
in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed by 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party therefore only barely missed the CDU , which could be back to 23 percent again .
the third place is contest@@ ed between the left and AF@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , which AF@@ D were first represented in the country &apos;s day with 19 percent .
despite a slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated with 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the heavy traffic day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the country &apos;s day with 3 percent .
according to the member of the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ chs , the SPD in the survey was only 23 per cent ( 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 per cent according to 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they are still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return that the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet at Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator was launched on the market .
today , the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and t@@ aller , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty knock .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ enium with high resolution today .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabyte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro , lovers can buy the equipment still on the Internet , but they come from the internet era of the internet era .
however , 20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West box . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax , the communic@@ ator was to reach .
even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser , if too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found itself .
quite proud the price was : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could think in August 1996 that Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not Nokia .
the mobile sphere of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
today , the market control providers that all ran much later than Nokia .
being online and everywhere , this is today for many people of everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million pieces were sold .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telec@@ ommun@@ ications companies are coming .
in the meantime , around the smartphone has created a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough to mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one thing : a music player , a phone and an internet communication ator easy to use via touch screen .
Apple began to triumph over Apple today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a replica .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ evident 20 years after its invention .
on average , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all the Smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said just Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personal staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a curse and blessing is at the same time as a curse and blessing .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only used in our local communities and throughout London , but in all the country &apos;s renovation and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in London in 2012 when we had a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will get there again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , creating youth unemployment in the aviation environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will flash at the world stage .
the two fl@@ anks had in@@ justice in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers to him every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the whole UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row at the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two busy cat@@ walk in the world .
now they are ready to provide a third running cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s extension is also one .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment , which England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding advertising block &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies which earn money from online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad block , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ oleum &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there were ad block@@ ages on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it hur@@ ried to update their filters in the program to block again advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements to identify it , which is part of the page advertisement , to make it harder to make .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rel@@ aun@@ ting Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Um@@ bre@@ eders has already been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company has left for social media in the struggle is a strong indicator of how wor@@ rying @-@ cur@@ ly for the industry has become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
worldwide , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , use the display block@@ oc@@ op@@ iers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users every day on Facebook to access their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is 84 per cent of the commerci@@ alized fac@@ ebooks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company has on advertis@@ ements on your desktop PCs , as mobile advertising block@@ ers did not have any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker shared with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advertisement on Desktop PC accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adop@@ ting new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the side that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users there is no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we concentrate on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide over@@ ride on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman was suspected of driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put in the Dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Wa@@ adt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , that of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , was wanted to over@@ ride himself .
it died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the case to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened an investigation , which is a logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a c@@ lash to avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - when a person ran on the highway on the motorway - was decided that drivers wouldn &apos;t have to go out that a pedestrian in the middle of the night running on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acquitted of the neg@@ ligent killing of killing a man , who was killed in August 2014 at the A1 near of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and is un@@ conscious of the street , took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the polic@@ emen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everybody who has further information on Thursday in the near of Morges should register at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate amo@@ del : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate change once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could have been referred to with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously noted that the slow movement of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ined atmosphere and slowly revol@@ ved .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet proved to be more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow movement of Venus is exp@@ on@@ ated for almost two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that is similar to evolution that has been suspected of planet research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the years .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when you left Hydro@@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a le@@ thal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate change in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the Colorado Plat@@ an@@ che and led to a minor role in the decision of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the last three years , I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have thought about how long and so I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey operations must perfectly be adapted to the organization &apos;s organization .
he must also have a co @-@ determination to make decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me of this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded as the best coach of the league at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ y take up discussions again , set strikes out
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour @-@ strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for North overseas workers will be suspended while all dispute parties for a new meeting table will put on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ service provider Wood Group were operated spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons may confirm that we re@@ united to re@@ begin the tri@@ cky process of current stress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the next weeks , start the beginning of next year to re@@ sign the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against potential wages of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year Wood Group has cut its rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is below a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .

the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the stell@@ en@@ ings of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ dream teles@@ cope has helped to gather the most complete catalog of rot@@ ations under the stars of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help to understand astronom@@ ers , and why stars in star@@ ry are rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are equipped with the Planet@@ arium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience through the compar@@ isons of our results , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena in a press release .
the Pl@@ ei@@ ades of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this star@@ ry , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach the adul@@ thood .
they now turn on the fastest .
at peak rates , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ters .
as these win@@ ch travel through the stars of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star counts , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the Rot@@ ational rate of each dying , recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognis@@ able star @-@ spot -- like s@@ lu@@ stro@@ us -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compare the stars with dancers , with larger star low pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Pl@@ ei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while against faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star@@ ters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal l@@ cosmic laboratory to compare special qualities as rot@@ ations .
&quot; the ple@@ ads of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
it is still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , W@@ ann and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ations and to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the ran@@ kings of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional return , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to join the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of the major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract compl@@ ained about 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player , it paid back Rodri@@ guez for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made a few mil@@ est@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only show two further bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics of similar values .
yet the 41 @-@ year @-@ old still should not be included in the rest hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field was that his appearance is outside of the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; in 2009 to have forbidden death oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect for many years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
in case of a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his deportation days also are not silent .
during many bas@@ eball legends in their last games once again , Rodri@@ guez had to sit often on the bank .
&quot; my job doesn &apos;t have a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az with the actress Cameron and the actress Kate Hudson , sympathy of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping test , weight @-@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Rio 2016 Olympic Games are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping event .
an caught athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ oping event will become known as Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ the@@ aters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were well tested and excluded - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news at the end time .
in the past Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated , which is used as a mascul@@ ine resource for d@@ oping resources .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in time on Friday afternoon of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final on 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.0@@ 9 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Chen would have allegedly participated in the premi@@ ums of over 50 m Freestyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B sample and an extra@@ dition hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but CA@@ S was responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also at night of Rio , the news post@@ ed through the positive test of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the best athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act with the forbidden substance for the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete &apos;s word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
so , approximately all weight li@@ fter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both deny the taking , but they may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly a major blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team , except for systematic d@@ oping the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the swimming sport , the former clubs in China had also cat@@ ered for violent disputes between the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio .
sun was also the center of a conflict with Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping bed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock .
datas@@ he@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware currently inter@@ fere with targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware ab@@ wehr @-@ specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , some times the victims of a attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already reached the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly to use the deliver@@ able from the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered software for themselves .
only private consumers were the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was sho@@ cking quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software will then present the demands of black@@ jack .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must be money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ Nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where private users can use the personal photo database on the game , there are companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage drops off when a ran@@ som@@ ware slip .
22 percent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had to stop the business activities completely , in case of a case , people were in danger of mort@@ al danger .
in Germany , many hospitals victims were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , get their data back again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the att@@ itudes of the perpet@@ rators in view of a stand@@ still .
h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researcher from F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user surface and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
you explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or un@@ cover for free example files .
and will be reim@@ bur@@ sed for payments by a few hundred Euro , companies have to pay partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers always share professional and share work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski by the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ jack .
the existing malware kits were created by malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ tion tool so smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so , in one of the forums on the underground , the set buys of a crime , and has a job to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is done per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry out sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is known by many companies , which secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains .
the potential for damages according to type of data is still higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also take fully new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference def@@ con , security for@@ gers demonstrated how they could get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the un@@ folding heating may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rator then block a whole production road instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday suit@@ ability
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather up@@ loading , but the HR @-@ V , who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved to be very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , there is no place close at any place .
the materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant , only the cockpit side falls off .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l , with presented back and 10@@ 26 l with pushed back @-@ backs , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel &apos;s seat is highly fli@@ pping and offer storage space from the bottom to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high .
the luggage boot is well loaded , however , the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range areas very powerful .
however , he should make his job a bit more qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine ization : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t have to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems belongs to the city @-@ emergency brake assist system ( work up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision avo@@ idance system and the column assistant .
sometimes the coll@@ ision guy irrit@@ ates sometimes because he has been rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ b@@ ating objects . &quot;
the teles@@ cop@@ ic assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler re@@ acts to traffic recognition and d@@ ros@@ é when needed the speed .
but the full connectivity is available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI @-@ jack are available under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday iron car .
Air@@ line is not stuck : down@@ fall to flight bridge
Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
as a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only in dangers , which are typical of air@@ freight , the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap when the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it can be a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
failure : when paid the organizer
canc@@ er@@ ers get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the dis@@ closed case , a family was heavily ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting in the second day of its turquoise .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective cl@@ ause which allegedly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the wast@@ e@@ water in fact was defective .
but the organis@@ er knew only shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of the water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly because of infection with each other - belong to the general risk of life .
only 38 people were sick of 6@@ 91 guests .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
the state must be temper@@ ed and respon@@ ding to terror at the same time .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
this triumph will not allow terrorists .
if off@@ ender would have to leave the country faster , this increase safety and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to achieve a implementation of the proposals by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; middle four @-@ digit mag@@ n@@ itude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sympathy for terrorism must be reduced again under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved that arms should be applied in order to ensure that the purchase of weapons will be added to the Internet .
the last much discussed per@@ spiration can remain to physi@@ cians according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with views of psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister holds a better social support for assistance .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
in tracking of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of a cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to increasing the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior said clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a whis@@ key for the sni@@ pers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel , Gabriel , spoke the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Ru@@ fe retired from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a general pro@@ hibition against the full ban &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t offer everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules , you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses .
green boss Simone Peter threw the Minister , he wanted to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packs of Tat@@ ation and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing writer Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet prover@@ bs and a waste of residence on the right bring the people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway zu@@ b@@ inger
it st@@ akes regularly on the stra@@ ight@@ forward road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the right of law should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are working on the environment street every evening in St@@ au when crossing the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ eler Street transfer road to 700 metres .
drivers can then catch the right away from the Hammer Straße .
the great advantage : traffic divi@@ des early on , whereby the total of the total operating procedure is improved on the multiple existing section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying the drivers particularly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days back up to the bridge over Alber@@ slo@@ g &apos;s way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 , just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be chann@@ elled across the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be built just three @-@ four@@ teen years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer necessary load capacity to take up heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related gest@@ ion will continue to say , the responsible country will not say .
however with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual time of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right fl@@ aming , the local company deliber@@ ately sought the traffic @-@ weaker time in school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be passing on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the boy Theater are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited this award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ cultural journey we visited 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years of st@@ aging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background to the aim , schools with welcome are the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the students of the class will be from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations it was possible to follow the action , so the press release of the Young theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ y@@ cles , and the young theater will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December you@@ ths are supposed to receive people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years , profession@@ ally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the given number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope on weather conditions
the weather was made by the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one gets around for et@@ ern@@ ally , at night it is up to hours of wake up , in the morning is far off to think of sleep any more .
that is anything but rest@@ ful .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep often than not rest@@ ful .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can be based on them diverse causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ oral and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you get in depth , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an in- and sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance .
just going through , many people feel like being uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ni@@ cht , a member of the German home@@ work association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep changes are complex .
there may be organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral @-@ related factors , but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleep problem expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often with depression frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors cause each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts to cra@@ ck about everyday problems and stim@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ e@@ ß gives an example . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep changes to your doctor ?
if you do not sleep well over a month for a month in at least three nights a week and the day is imp@@ aired , it should be a doctor .
the draw@@ back can look quite differently : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ tired , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or drugs - classic dor@@ z@@ eng@@ es only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , Professor Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly empha@@ sized in Germany .
this is why you should initially contact with sleeping difficulties at first , says We@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy with exam@@ inations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for example , medical advice , for example , in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory care , in case of a path@@ ogenic daily we@@ ar@@ iness , if you do not find the cause of a diar@@ rhe@@ a , explains Fi@@ etz@@ e .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the inquiry .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not make a lunch@@ time , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after wired , one gets into the bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body one carries a nostr@@ ils , chest strap and a tor@@ ch at finger .
in addition , a camera has a blanket on the ceiling .
how can frau@@ dul@@ ent problems get the handle ?
there are quite many po@@ stu@@ res which can be used for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is counting on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not sleep television to sleep , alcohol and at night not to watch out at the clock - then you begin to see immediately , and that &apos;s all and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold himself to the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is by Facebook for the dis@@ appointing end of the DS@@ V team .
in December 2014 , he took the first gold world championships for the first time in Doha at the same time , and set his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler now protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 150,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the convey@@ ing system in swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping controls , however , very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that do not promote a lot and do not even watch the d@@ oping in such a way or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to restart a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start from the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled before World Cup / OS of independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A cannot take part , &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ic@@ ec@@ ele .
airport : gang of luggage arrested
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police squ@@ ad on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the crime f@@ susp@@ ect had committed several bags and bag @-@ pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil servants detected a gang at the airport &apos;s Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the police officers of last theft .
since mid @-@ July this year the two women and two men had committed several del@@ icacy , working hard , working hard , and very professional .
the specialists in the Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ ari@@ ate 34 may have the th@@ ie@@ ves , which were especially embar@@ r@@ assed by criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they had taken over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , some lin@@ den baths , in between still a rest head@@ stone p@@ av@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in seems to appear at first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the east to the west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has been ugly on the facade of a gray home ! &quot;
compared with a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demolished , it will be built until 2017 : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the responsible property company Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in calls , are illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why the house is occupied with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants of the lease , on the ground floor , are still occup@@ ying spaces and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially since the beginning of the year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 declared as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having been evacu@@ ated on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were evacu@@ ated , according to the police three weeks the official statements on site , locked out parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owner on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin District Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction worker went under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking pre @-@ washed late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there is an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are primarily generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects they share the concern of rising air and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a pine , who wanted to make himself a majority shar@@ k on the left hand .
the dit@@ ch , the Berlin inside of the Berlin inside and the police between the owners and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ district , which also has a lower average at present in comparison to the rest of the city .
also house @-@ occup@@ ations and the native residential projects have been occupied for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer road very close to the Rig@@ s .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under big police force , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and election liner from all over the world : with them inhabitants of GDR life @-@ times and former domestic her@@ al@@ ers share their vac@@ ant .
this has also felt noticeable during the rent , which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ builds on the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on collected disks or freshly painted faç@@ ades that have been fitted with dyes .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for that not all neighbors could see this as a problem could be that they are not imp@@ acted by crime : criminal off@@ ences , such as bodi@@ ly infr@@ in@@ gement , according to polic@@ emen , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the crimes make tangible damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
regarding acts of violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours that do not have been this .
even the famous burning cars can no longer give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for studying architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer became aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
that is why it was also so important that local residents get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the inter@@ pret@@ ations of the city in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street is still being taken away : by sin@@ king new buildings into former building g@@ aps that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not as good as they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not be ath@@ ei@@ ving . &quot;
but what should one do when somebody is never listening to ?
on all sides are fru@@ stration , even with the police and residents .
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for breeding , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
those who prefer to be conscious - just like someone who moves in a pub , can complain badly about noise .
all persons only with the names presented are asked to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner within the integration and organizer of the organization .
moreover , she is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officers for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedagog@@ ue supports the management team at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is mis@@ leading .
Reg@@ ine customer from working group indicates that the honorary member is more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , that has an ancient wo@@ ol@@ at@@ au that has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly rather than on the multitude of desired tasks , meant - meant as the management wanted to write the place .
an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ term experience in the area of social work , just an experienced Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le comments .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as power activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has supported honest and full time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are standing in the water@@ way
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized .
for the connection purposes , the mun@@ icipalities are responsible .
they need to enter@@ tain refugees in their own or rented premises .
the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodation must carry the mun@@ icipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes ownership of the Land@@ rats to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
do not work so far , so you need to depend on private apartments so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be applied as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the water@@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree on .
in addition to a firm lead , training places , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house monsters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external influence .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but work is not just a job .
the day needs a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a rig@@ orous feeling .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are scar@@ ce .
so there are administration and volunteers here .
it &apos;s central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long period of procedures is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it just takes , and can bridge the time wis@@ er , for example with language courses .
those who even develop the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , must not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problems , however , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always willing to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this has been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the recent predi@@ ctions be afraid of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some can call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ dual risk can and does not want to exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have fear that the assass@@ in will bring them fully into re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary citizens must be on site and in the region according to activities .
in the background , they are always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the policies rever@@ ts .
actually , it is un@@ fair to hire them off @-@ site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there , where we want , &quot; An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already ast@@ o@@ unded to in@@ corporate the previous people .
that is about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need to help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
chim@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ers with helicopter sought
the police helicopter flew off different areas for about one hour - un@@ successfully .
two unknown men are violent in an apartment house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the people surprised the two and struck the accident in the run .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , carrying both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pow@@ ders .
they flee towards the city center .
the police put several strikes and police helicopter as well as a police helicopter .
the clu@@ stering went out without success .
perhaps the unknown before the apartment fell close to the flat , or at their escape .
