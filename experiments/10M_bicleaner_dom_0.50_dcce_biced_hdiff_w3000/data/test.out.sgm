<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitor is one of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to hold in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish and regulate the economy to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by contrast, it would be quite different, he asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will regain regulators, and he will be strong for a wide control reform with lower controls, for private people and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said against it: the state has given certain tasks, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both of them are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost answer.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state treasurer Tehry-Wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So multi-internal discussions could be given to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive the coal transport in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, to denounce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton wants to strengthen and strengthen renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazian trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better, Clinton calls for around Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says:" "" "the minimum wage must be up, then he says he doesn't change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, so the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clinton's share on the other side is Clinton who wants to pay at least by the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who alone flee alone, almost daily life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worse.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands of the hands and an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin taketh his Turkish opposite player in the gold-gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I cannot defend this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiled a bit of malodly and radiant heat, even for its restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">But on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "love" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have had like something like it would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable bolle showed that Russia's position didn't forget anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time has been slipped.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, who fell to his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even bigger, as it was committed by a promised friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vetrower will rebuild, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed like the Turks would carry for everything the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations from executive officials, that Erdogans would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which would be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed to get all friends that he can get after he had failed last month with a failed coup d'état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of charter flights which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and chargers will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late ailled onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the public TV attracted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural import will be relegated.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists stay long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious in the West, since there was a response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the ongoing grounding over the snow entempo of EU accession talks and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian President, in Ankara, won a bonus for the attempted coup attempt to support the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">Indeed, this is a self-understanding for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glittery palace in the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, which once described me a analysts," "" "The Alliance of Foreign Side" "" ": two countries which violate themselves from the West and are now badly treated." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support the intentional sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first call, both presidents say on the press conference that they hadn't even roamed the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the president of Turkey failed to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on what a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has arranged" "" "dismissal Ivanovs" "" "by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was representative of the Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it's called (in Russian) that later he later became the principal of protocols and atroopers of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of government and inspections to support your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his followers.</seg>
<seg id="13">See the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">SergeIvanov was a long time one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "during a meeting with President Putin, it was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was coming back at his own request." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the consequence of a kind of power struggle here?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody currently knows this.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was appointed as a potential President, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - came across large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation with me at the beginning of 2012 - it could almost say - an estimated post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential government for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a member of the KGB state Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Bundessional Intelligence Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his Deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin made his power to the power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov could have been president of Russia after Putin's second official term, as a third term of Putin would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, close ally of Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the flow between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity which require extremely accurate tolerances for fit.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "" "" living concept "" "" to the next meeting. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch as the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer able to play outside, but rather it is preferable to spend their free time on screens in the last decade of many bemourn.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go you go to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I consider myself of course based on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later formed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of popculture, interest in the release of the game in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players are going outside with their smartphone outside and searching for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and when they were once found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and leaped for searching the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users recently, the Washington Post told that within two days of launching the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent, who jumped from 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw material to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns of health that people want to take" "" "get 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active for deaf ears every day, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that it is fun to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of the health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even conclude new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there is also mürric playing destroyers which have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk towards a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier could already follow our activity, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its appeal and the use is reduced with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and helping many people in hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine among the women's olympiamity in the gymnasium and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three monkeys, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, is Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicin, rounds every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years, number one was one of the female gymnasies an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the unbelievable performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they were expecting, but masterful Gymasticocroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold for women at an individual meeting event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Club member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but don't look around in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team is only four gymnast in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks so much that Turns become an expensive sport and Turner first and foremost in private gymnastics that come up from parents, who come up for training, setup, travel and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will get their overall training and this is a pleasure for families and a long term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainers of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the action.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must enable the congregations of Aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, enable a powerful and easier to access gyms.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my trainee for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have provided free and affordable turnes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health, and for training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the action and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different background motivates to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller moved to his immune system and dignitaries of a serious test - by trying some of the most dirty and most common places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travelautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will wipe its course on a Euro bill, a banker at Piccadilly Circus, a push-in front of a train in Russia and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before losing every object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to be embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of losing the flush button of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen washbasin.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to physicians and medical professionals to promote bowel bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left, what he left, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations up to flush buttons of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unworried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just fine in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proofing showed an Luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison with this the Luminometric number of fresh hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet that he refused to stop after their Luminometric count was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the bacterial score in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I have gerocked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here, because it is inside a ecelist here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that interest in healthy health will be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the healthy health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film directed by the film, added:" "" "let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, whom I have instructed to lick it, like the ekels Russian toilet that is shown in the movie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to put Ian to lick it, and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delights on film. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals gain nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to select the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country code will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as so far it does not work: summer break, heat and land battle throes - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the elections, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists, which are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, are not allowed to choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays we distribute posters, inflamed posters, distribute air balloon, distribute flyer and put out at the end of the vote, just struggling with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the campaign very close by the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">My hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting, as strongly newing AFD cuts and what remains at the end of coalitioners.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age, and has been head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, considering its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, roses roses and chatting a little with the people, as it did already his legendary golden precursor to Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blends the debt of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We create" "" "accelerates the rise of recopoists, which is now likely to cost the nice office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is, if you make the wrong time in the right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel at great search for Chancellor Angela Merkel; the German Parliament is in the north east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it was also no one to anyone from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the northeastern CDU will largely abstain from market conditions and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so Kokert, plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that, on the land, you have to crumble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left hand, the SPD, the Green: in the wake of the country scarcely present.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU campaign against his fellow countrymen is also self-larvingly:" "" "they have to go to where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorsal, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because as much stands on the game, Sellering has called for his SPD in a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats were at least 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only just before AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD was still clearly won by 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party, with seven percent in the polls, can bring the jump into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the vacation period and make their campaign great advantage over the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before applying for commentations to oversowed him under the pseudonym non-defensive men's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most controversial re-emergence of records are not shown on a boom in millennials, who want to greet the curiosity of physical objects, but for mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record, all previews are between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog was to be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I carry on a busy street in Soho, a humble gray suit before I steal, my hands hold and somewhat determining as:" "" "so, let's look at a closer look." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent seller were based, there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: eight men of middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have ca. 3000 or 4000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me a snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy panels, which he could not afford to buy records when they had been released and sold again when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are released from the late 60's, early 70's, which was released when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who buy records, rather introverted and happy to spend his own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, which he meets, meet the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, who have heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations which I have led, people normally have emptied up their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs will now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record shops offers a calming community of equal ties.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to turn back to stability of trusted soundtracks, waking up from things to waking lucky jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of materials possessions than a kind of consolation," "" "said WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is as collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "like an employee from a flat stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who have bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I blush through a stack of Bossa Nova.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged) has noticed a "trophy effect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came down here and said:" I have no turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record, so I can put them to the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound of the sound almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience than I purify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples over 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women of central age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sexcpacket pop instead of experimental jazz is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychic traumata are hard to imagine if you stand for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elotuba, 27, runs around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop bumblebee as a bulk purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting of records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records" ""... "she drives with a disloved sighs." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance of jeans Hotas, I observe a group of young teenager who group to group about Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter proves to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering the fact that every attraction for these objects may mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of Soil could be for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also that is the most for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research showed that the results of YouGov agree, they let at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record labels that exist in reality, stores and Onlineresearch.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning with certainty through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they starred by a sinister, 30-year-old false moderator that rises above the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain brings silver in 7-year Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold.</seg>
<seg id="2">UK's impressive performance at 7-year Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji, a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, press back, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the non-poor consolation of silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the ks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had struck a 15-man team in top form in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not be that at least one gold medal is a gold medal to hang on his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England at Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slack is hurt, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of having fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt right for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau entered the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another assault from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">Scarcely 12-0 and GB scarcely appealed the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hackable tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua entered a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new record since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prejudiced by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as I was born in Fiji to play the 7 while still learnt.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant midplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favour of the South-sesulans, whose fans sang, flags swings and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i dot dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff finds, the fijis hugged and kickle crushing defeat in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day in Fiji had conquered Japan in semi-final with 20-5 and Britain thronged South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling von Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-member teams, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no engine inaleres of gold as with these games and that will mean what hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard hieve which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the rod, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was there for the second Olympics in a row without a control woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who put on a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter unsuperimposed deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete that reflect on the surface with the elegance of tears, which does not reflect the way of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a bataillon on the willing helpers that make the difference and it was no one more comfortable than the trainer, who wouldn't know that day would survive if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start out what the interruption was at a minimum, if that's the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing on itself is a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inasibility of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nerving morning so spent a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning who as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment was in use in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that might be something extremely, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how many things I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to trainee or wish a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen cried," "" "Wait in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time, we weren't looking forward to making something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV Adventure of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Singsel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: she was in the choir's choir as a young girl, in his teacher's studies, and today the 78-year-old sings in a chidlren choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is also a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors singing in chorus and sharing the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can build and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">For often they solve social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also has made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be arduous in the positive sense, the hicer means.</seg>
<seg id="12">By doing so, pensioners exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who require the lungs regularly calls for everyday life, not so quickly from the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">To elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German labour community of seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs by older people wakes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song textured and especially tunes, human beings persevered themselves in long covered events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required by singing, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simultaneously focusing on his own voice and to a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone, practice not only to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgement that one learns through singing in chorus, hicer means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing by singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show themselves: if I am long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, it should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is already listening to sound?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone comes from the circle of people in an old enchyenchyma, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views on choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church officers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many veteran choirs can be found also on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who wants to sing, should be able to join a choir says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing well the soul well and has something bad - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress, while investigating the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also gave that" "" "experts sometimes really appreciate the interpretation of complex data, and that the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have returned the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year, however, President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honourable invaluable military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, when an CentCom analyst summed up only a small occupying force in Iraq, and a little time on insistent on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hookers asks for specifying government officials, that contrary to the statements of the government held by the Islamic State, no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had taken, since these provisional refineries had been put into service in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>

<seg id="32">Centcoms's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie drew Bam also the first two gates for the American Feldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans have won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually display a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they can't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Briton in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will go the strong Dutch slightly longer, which will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may end on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vertebrae in their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in their hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player from the USA, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as it was not able to qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 where she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig was called Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work place in London which we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can handle the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the game, but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and kept the pitch of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and emptied the ball in the gate to get a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the Torkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a goal in any of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and evasive, a fast relay between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect the swimmer to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn the TV, read a paper or listen to your neighbor's queue in the coffee shop without hearing without Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's dun with dimples, could have been thoroughly sent under this known name, which would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and feel-TV advertising if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even barrels.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I do not make good arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although an Olympic event has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so sparsely perceived that many people I asked, didn't know that it is an Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the U.S. athlete for competition, it has never won a medal in the tramway jumping and had won an athlete until 2012, who made it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has some outer nature charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert but only a true enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending spool - but also the grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports, which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from Spanish El trampoline, which means so much like "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winner jumping on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and must land a row of falling motions (turning, hedgehog and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official Olympiad programme, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further in their quest to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the end, sometimes and back, up and down, down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV broadcast also another polite objective: the world or the Olympic lord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-directed striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking for these games as a little.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prone, seemingly heelos like an astronaut, goes to the top, then down again, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Again there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as strong as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of a afternoons of two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will probably survive in general tumult.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long is a member of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protests were killed during clashes with police in the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid part of West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and spread themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people invaded the streets and the fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was relentless, according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen crusted to unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos of the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with shocks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for a previous study.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to stick this country and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are closely associated with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">The infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually calm, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to suppress the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent into prison, driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomforts, which cover everything from ground work to the sausages in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts predict that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced to use more or less forces in recent years, and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of delimation after years ago Hinkuckles under the surface can now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government bulls access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, so many people can still communicate about internet proxies that hide it, where they may stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they were gathered together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äesons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's mainly Christian high countries, in politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos of which many Muslims are living and living in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is just changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and the military, in the secret services, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-public illness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly sensitive to use early signs of dissatisfaction, and to use special officers to edit opponents, and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region north of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested according to analytics, and were subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razos many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and that time of unrest was passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader in their visionary infrastructure plans, such as the new Pendulum Act, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this does not hinder the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, run by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dating flights beyond the neighboring Somalia, even when she recently told that she closed the base.</seg>
<seg id="58">As the West will clearly support democracy, he doesn't want his associate in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day that Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>

<seg id="14">In late July he moved up strong criticism, when he said that the Russians should have Mrs. Clintons of mails, but he later explained "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic limits in politics and then turn back to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the sound for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an ear-whose tone, because his circumstance has declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to apologize for his provocative remarks, he accused his critics often to distort his testimony or his humour wrong.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trump joke having brought his loyal fellow countrymen to his uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent interrespondents, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="24">It's true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization that he called her backbänkler, completely false, and so it was because he pulled out the troops from Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="9">The new version has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafés, the owner and the manager of the new café.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he did not know a roar that the soap business has taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie began to produce a special soap for verb with the coffee-packed coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go down on their offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">Born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he gets on average just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it accelerates the five meters long animal on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, however, appears to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness" is commenting on the Max Planck Institute of demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland sharks become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to watch, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they appear mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little to know about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time lupin bends, as they took six animals in front of valbard, with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrouers at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadaver producing from higher water layers into downstream.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch of the North Atlantic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the shark of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lashes already occurs before the birth of the sharks, which are not restored in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore, after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try to reduce large amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the lens also contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its study in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its lenticle, all major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities, which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign a age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably at the threshold of the sexually mature stood and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks became apparent at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This also might be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane lees live primarily in icy waters, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The present record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland wal, in whose bacon was damaged a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the living animals living there are frequently living animals of the animals living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they richer later - and then slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal is heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on taking as many descendants early as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist scrubbing." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should always invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish team called Callum Skinner's last evening in the Männerteam Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the Anchorage, who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. he took the legend and stormed the legend to visit a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">It repeated the trick, after they took place in London in March, despite the backlog of Hoys, just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when Hinds appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retire a gap to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed as they saw potential in the villi, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - which was four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner in the qualification round a Olympiarord, but at the standarround the New Zealanders wins the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was close to his lap, but Kenny took the team up and Skinner stopped.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation, during which the execution in a higher speed drove to slow him down and to enable it to keep pace and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell off Skinner, Kenny and Hinder than these rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which have been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of Possible that he is repeating Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a very sacred date for the British Sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is taking part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand on the game, because the system operator will denounce the energy supply agreement and thus ensure all delivery contracts, as the supply of energy companies is divided.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to run the facility.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa Farm plant in Portland are standing on the game.</seg>

<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three other owners are denounced their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware" "", "says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private consumers were the goal, but the change to company attacking was shocking quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software will then present the demands of blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must be money - usually in the form of CryptoNutrition Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users can use the personal photo database on the game, there are companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage drops off when a ransomware slip.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent had to stop the business activities completely, in case of a case, people were in danger of mortal danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, many hospitals victims were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only encourages the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, get their data back again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the attitudes of the perpetrators in view of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researcher from F-Secure examines the user surface and the contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or uncover for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be reimbursed for payments by a few hundred Euro, companies have to pay partly hard and pay five-digit sums to withdraw their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers always share professional and share work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski by the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes a adaption tool so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then look for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums on the underground, the set buys of a crime, and has a job to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry out spammers with the spread," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is known by many companies, which secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes survey rely on Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski explains.</seg>
<seg id="41">The potential for damages according to type of data is still higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take fully new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference defcon, security forgers demonstrated how they could get a connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the unfolding heating may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then block a whole production road instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets around for eternally, at night it is up to hours of wake up, in the morning is far off to think of sleep any more.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but restful.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often than not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can be based on them diverse causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schlafforal and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you get in depth, however, is the insomnia, so an in- and sleeping disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just going through, many people feel like being unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknicht, a member of the German homework association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep changes are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There may be organic, psychological or behavioral-related factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep problem expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often with depression frequently," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors cause each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "whoever has a herniated disc can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts to crack about everyday problems and stimulate," "" "Weeß gives an example." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep changes to your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a month for a month in at least three nights a week and the day is impaired, it should be a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The drawback can look quite differently: it is smitten, tired, untired, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or drugs - classic dorzenges only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Professor Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is hardly emphasized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should initially contact with sleeping difficulties at first, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, medical advice, for example, in snoring with respiratory care, in case of a pathogenic daily weariness, if you do not find the cause of a diarrhea, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a lunchtime," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After wired, one gets into the bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body one carries a nostrils, chest strap and a torch at finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera has a blanket on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can fraudulent problems get the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many postures which can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is counting on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not sleep television to sleep, alcohol and at night not to watch out at the clock - then you begin to see immediately, and that's all and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="22">Many of the newbuilds on the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on collected disks or freshly painted façades that have been fitted with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for that not all neighbors could see this as a problem could be that they are not impacted by crime: criminal offences, such as bodily infringement, according to policemen, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the crimes make tangible damages, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">Regarding acts of violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours that do not have been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars can no longer give it right in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer became aware of the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that local residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretations of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away: by sinking new buildings into former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are people who are not as good as they are," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can absolutely not be atheiving."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do when somebody is never listening to?</seg>
<seg id="36">On all sides are frustration, even with the police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for breeding, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer to be conscious - just like someone who moves in a pub, can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons only with the names presented are asked to be called by their right name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner within the integration and organizer of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officers for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is misleading.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from working group indicates that the honorary member is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, that has an ancient woolatau that has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mockingly rather than on the multitude of desired tasks, meant - meant as the management wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-term experience in the area of social work, just an experienced Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as power activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle has supported honest and full time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the waterway</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection purposes, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to entertain refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes ownership of the Landrats to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not work so far, so you need to depend on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be applied as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the waterway.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree on.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, training places, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house monsters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But work is not just a job.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a rigorous feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there are administration and volunteers here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long period of procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it just takes, and can bridge the time wiser, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who even develop the feeling he could not work in Urbach, must not work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "problems, however, says customer honestly," "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always willing to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this has been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the recent predictions be afraid of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some can call naive." "" "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the assassin will bring them fully into revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary citizens must be on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they are always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policies reverts.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to hire them off-site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived there, where we want," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already astounded to incorporate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need to help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
