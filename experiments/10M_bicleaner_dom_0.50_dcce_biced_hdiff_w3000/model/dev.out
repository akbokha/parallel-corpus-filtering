Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abi@@ lizing action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it should also take the conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s territory of settlement and raises the lack of intention at the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Netanyahu had kept a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ron@@ ed against Obama .
the speech was not pronounced at Obama , a meeting with reference to the upcoming election was rejected in Israel .
in a emergency call he is professor to have shot his friend
in a emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told him about a somewhat z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb is important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still live and probably excited , and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials came from Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that was on a white block . I &apos;m sorry , I could und@@ o it , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had worked in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , built already 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed for the police a popular film processor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Pe@@ er@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : a lamb took up life when the police had en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers have forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details of the medi@@ ation on both ends of the state published details , as also what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ ish died , he did not have any history of violence or criminal incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose fac@@ ulty members comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some ex@@ propri@@ ation of problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ c , the Lamb , said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent amendments to the University of Employment told that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked hard as hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic way to position as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ un@@ ge said that he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
we are asking questions that Lamb can &apos;t answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found in Lam@@ bs later when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas again .
before he could be arrested , Lamb shot himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the region .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which took 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagog@@ y .
he earned his doctorate in pedagog@@ y in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together by joint friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach the guitar game .
he was a s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls acc@@ ol@@ inate when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ ish , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came out two years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light @-@ lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said he Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night ended last night after Lamb ch@@ ase his guitar and harmon@@ i@@ re@@ els .
there was no sign of it that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were both meeting and chat@@ ted together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and speci@@ alizes in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lecturer , employees , students and members of the municipality took part in a candle light commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the cock@@ at@@ guard , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
the Associated Press writers Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected in order to resist the police now saying that Lamb shot the emergency , and that Lamb is shot in his emergen@@ cies as his wife , but there was no indication that the two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox ra@@ ges on his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it seems to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ lim@@ mer and a measuring length of it , with the Princess of Wales for a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spielberg .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; general Secretary Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
on a press conference on Wednesday , he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five @-@ standing member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the br@@ ink of the annual general meeting of the AG@@ M in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that stepp@@ ing on the Council and the Syrian people and the regional government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they proved to deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear deal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 ) Ask men that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to stamp him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but doesn &apos;t matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump of the top rope at surveys , it &apos;s still not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means to the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate company .
of course it &apos;s too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that during this period in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was sent to the rising of Herman Cain , one of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but outdoor groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ an &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth Rec@@ re@@ detect Tr@@ umps St@@ aying Power and begin to over@@ flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump &apos;s popularity rates have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the estate of Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
early August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep up in the early States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa , noted last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can have a good view of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with pump@@ ing as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey by CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can , they would be either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump is nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two out of 10 , they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same bu@@ zz as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they would &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the leader of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans cannot be called Tr@@ ump @-@ temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is well critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Irish voters think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first priority state of nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality in order to effectively do his job , and nearly six out of 10 ir@@ regul@@ ators say that his temper@@ ament did not lead to the White House , as ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they apply their validity , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters keep for@@ bad for real .
when asked to be asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the moment when four of ten have put their money on je@@ b Bush since the end of July .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters didn &apos;t have the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ s thought that Rick Per@@ ry had the nom@@ ination to win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P elec@@ tr@@ umps shows themselves as a plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered itself to another candidate , Tr@@ ump gr@@ ind almost everybody .
some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field is likely to lead to tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump har@@ ms the majority support .
he chose Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a narrow majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump , say they have set up their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change my mind .
46 per cent said they had to leave the door open to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the Neuro@@ surgeon and Ben Car@@ son , but voters think they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they match with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; from Mexico &quot; by his election campaign , the emig@@ ration and piv@@ ot@@ al point in the public dis@@ course was held in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expansion of H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the restructuring efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey carried out by Monday six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they dis@@ agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it doesn &apos;t seem to have Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration of the government climbed to new high@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can elec@@ tors falls , mainly through their out@@ sider @-@ status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post they want to call a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Iowa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four Iowa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by rep@@ ubli@@ can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 54 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the Five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea desert .
in the street , it will cost one square metre of a beach@@ front accommodation on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; the supply of objects is limited in accordance with objects , meaning the high price in the study .
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter of most costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ d in Munich are not really little .
as opposed to Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service company Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers published an ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of indi@@ ans per square meter , thou@@ ght@@ ful .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two cou@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a successful hit by Thomas Müller made the way FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereign in the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off match in the Champions League of the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) , with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start to the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ hi@@ t to Munich in the third race .
Müller won the Champions League for Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who allowed him to pass a fl@@ ank shot shot of the world champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich holding word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea , without it to shine .
pirates had won his most recent six home games in the pinn@@ acle , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled on .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , they often went plain to works .
the attacks were introduced too often by gambling on the left edge of Douglas Costa , who frequently came to the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than its fl@@ ank out of the right hemisph@@ er@@ mine in the left upper jaw .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
in half one , Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half .
initially , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct delivery , tor@@ ment@@ or Roberto was par@@ ed by his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
though the Bayern dominated it with a dominant game , Pir@@ lo was able to place con@@ if@@ ers .
but on ke@@ epers of the case , however , Manuel Neuer was .
something like this , when he saw a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola introduced a quar@@ ry with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Di@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final ining , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ master Matthias Sam@@ mer in Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to do something else is a v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the p@@ aired Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter recovered Müller .
before the game , it was come to Kra@@ f@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly avoided Bavaria @-@ Fans in their viewers @-@ block clearly the supporters of the host pi@@ on@@ ward with words and gest@@ ures prov@@ oked , the security forces att@@ acking the security forces and went against the Munich followers .
a Bayern @-@ Fan was being transported out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
the smo@@ kes , it doesn &apos;t harm the lungs , but also to the teeth , which makes a Pots@@ dam@@ er Lang@@ era study .
the good news : when using zi@@ cht , the risk is rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers in smokers the risk of losing their teeth in time are higher than 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay , dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , the authors emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is due to frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , in what extent will smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , take over ten years until the threat again to the level of non @-@ smokers , declared first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one needs to convince people to be smo@@ ker , declared research leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge as well to a good dental health until high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of co@@ el@@ ess@@ ness are affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth capture .
the new long @-@ term study sign@@ alled the findings .
archae@@ ologists at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants from the Sp@@ ät@@ antique
the repeated time at the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne archaeological finds have been made .

since the beginning of the construction work on Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans have been in search of ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the Cologne district , the museum will always be used as a specialist for archae@@ ological floor care .
the third phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards became the ar@@ che@@ ologists now .
it has already been known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have been a church , described Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and church tower , a cemetery with some 350 dit@@ ches were discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in conflict on TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private lighting equipment for corpor@@ ations between corpor@@ ations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which clearly equ@@ ates more traditional dishes in its function . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German Government announced support .
by TTIP the world &apos;s largest free trade zone should arise with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration proceedings imp@@ lies that the EU states and the US have jointly chosen independent judges for a new investment district . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and the third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against judgement .
so far , the process involved have agreed on the arbit@@ rators , a g@@ ushing possibility for their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion of the past months has become clear that citizens don &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards a International investment district .
there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states could also be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration panel ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially from large companies as one of the major reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional clin@@ ic@@ ers are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parallel . the tax pay@@ er will ride upon tax pay@@ ers , budget national laws , or to impos@@ e a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ action reported the proposals of the European Commission under in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ized especially that they should not apply for the negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German business state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ lah ( SPD ) signed the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission has made considerable points in the reform of the reform of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans by Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate bond Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against restrictions the action options of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was said .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the issue of investment protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is considered not to be better .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens was sitting on stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , to which the shy , acting fol@@ ks@@ ong developed the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly caught by Stev@@ ens lecture .
it tells about different places that he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ated and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were created , and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens beha@@ ved himself as wonderfully creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear smart@@ ly composed songs that can end harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted anytime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a rum@@ our that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a woven series : each of the 50 states should be st@@ owed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ burg already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and has a positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to reduce Stev@@ ens grows up here .
he will meet guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician comes back to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ king &quot; ) appeared in 2005 a nationwide master@@ piece .
bor@@ rowed for ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no time list of the influential music media in no time .
according to extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then worked on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic publishers .
this sixth regular studio album is still largely orchest@@ rated but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any kind of effect and rever@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away to the smaller clubs , the stage shows here for the colorful spectacle of Neon @-@ head@@ bands and big fluores@@ cent stages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is touring with Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in dark @-@ held Hamburger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; at theater , he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although close to 2000 guests are banned in their chairs , the mature Stev@@ ens comes back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group &apos;s excellent musicians play through the well @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens modest , plays only few older songs and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question .
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question is expected by the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour president Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ naire , and to enter for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to mid@@ day in order to get the first of his six @-@ given questions briefly , with his performance from the media likely and the Labour delegation from the proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also told that he could skip some sessions to their colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary ver@@ ification for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for it comes to his appointment to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ir@@ in@@ ae and his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain &apos;s national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands in the focus of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood in respec@@ tful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the former ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s top team , and they were called for differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent for BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wag@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks to the European Union and the limit for winning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour make changes to remove all the idea of a restri@@ ction .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of employment and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory Chief since the last decade , on the disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , which promised another policies , says he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions relating to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bol@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is at the front of the Prime Minister , and that he has both meant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bol@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is occup@@ ying the shadow of economic minist@@ ries , if he is not taking part - for example , if Mr. Cameron is on the way abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk about that other colleagues occasionally lay down the word , and that he was talking about John Ber@@ cow , the speakers of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later , he acknowledged that he failed .
since it was sent on television in 1990 , the question@@ n@@ as was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a caric@@ ature and require far reaching reforms .

pounds increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the UK
the pound has consistently increased according to data , which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , F@@ T@@ SE 100 increased by the fan base SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and re@@ inv@@ alu@@ able in 2009 on the time of interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the takeover offer at the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands like Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were highly encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods - 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - mel@@ ts growth again .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ CO@@ RE rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline since Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the company rating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the start @-@ up for the year reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages compromise the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says a higher wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of the potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s unlikely that purchasing power will be the higher cost of labour at his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster produces kn@@ ick for potato and woo@@ fers
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
it is both - and the potato driver , which is developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ al@@ keeper Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the prover@@ b &quot; potato instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster using a Peg@@ ida demonstration in a demonstration called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance in television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop there is a barbecue that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has made the Lebanese man in Munich since the patent office in Munich .
since recently , it has been protected by the authority as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes does the sk@@ e@@ wer do , Al@@ hay wants not to give away .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash launches cash @-@ time campaign for tac@@ kling al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ spann@@ ing campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are prepared to strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A by mainst@@ ream media and marketing about social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed samples in IG@@ A stores and sell shop@@ ke@@ epers , which sell used tickets to the South Australian soccer league .
it is expected that Met@@ cash is published further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol , and equipment consistently passes its annual investors strategy .
there is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ der stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ically provincial and IG@@ A retailers are a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di will s@@ lash around five per cent of the food market in these two countries after opening his first markets , but will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent individual tra@@ ders .
a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley says that IG@@ A retail@@ er will lose 360 $ million in turnover each year and a cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food and in case of high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares fall into the Eastern states , mostly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley accepts that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the feed and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne , shows that Met@@ cash will probably be within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board member of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which is approx . 1.200 percent since 2012 , which is a result of the operating debt reduction in relation to sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers w@@ anders back and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , and IG@@ A retailers to improve their stores by faster growing fresh foods and to provide better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that price custom@@ iz@@ ations and shop re@@ training programs will be at Elan , hoping for the first time to return to profit @-@ growth in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ or@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick C@@ gios and deser@@ ved much praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is called again as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; by the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Cy@@ ril with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon , Kok@@ or@@ ak@@ is and his opponent murdered Harrison twice through the arbit@@ rators and Harrison set out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA should have been killed by C@@ yr@@ gios , and I should punch the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp crashed out by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ or@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I should offer me fairly need@@ less is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was caught in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken up a ra@@ cket , when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was treated a little too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly did not support the decision to take into consideration for the most important decisions on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to be a long @-@ term permanent feature to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely concentrated in the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding it &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick gained very quickly the ascent , where@@ with people like Feder@@ er and Murray he pointed out and deserves all the criticism that he can think of it . some time out of the lim@@ el@@ ight he can think about it , and it &apos;s best for the crew , and it &apos;s best for the crew , and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declared Not@@ ice , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the not@@ ary and advised the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that the attempted to stop illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were gathering at Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials with indig@@ nation re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who fled from violence took place for an unknown time in a while on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and were down there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them suspended the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Close the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and calling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ y@@ police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some pointed from protest to food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable that migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece would arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a harsh meeting in Brussels failed to agree on joint immigration policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who have taken refuge in the survived Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigrants crisis in the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary won &apos;t sit down its hopes on an early action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block down roads and spe@@ eded up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ amm@@ ers were at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees and elsewhere in the Middle East to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban decided that most of the upcoming econom@@ ists are , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws , coming into force at midnight , make the crossing of the border or the damaged 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia concerning a crime . these laws also sti@@ pul@@ ate higher liability for the traff@@ ickers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that has been developed through the mass emig@@ ration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press will have seen heavily armed soldiers with cars and dogs on days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border crossing the border , 15 others have already invaded the country .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now engaged in police custody and are accused of off@@ ense of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are involved to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning as well as two of the seven mar@@ g@@ inal passes with Serbia , after having arrived on bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push down there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 20 succeeded in passing but thousands were left outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway @-@ connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s promin@@ ence ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her towards the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced he had jurisdiction for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which candidates can support them .
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while s@@ anders had achieved some gains .
Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and mis@@ ses , but these jumps have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men is clearly dec@@ lining , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage by democratic voting under 50 years has become more vol@@ at@@ ted , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a huge margin in the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in mind , with two @-@ digit lead with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of democratic v@@ oter voters say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because she is a candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about it .
the views are stronger with those who are not supported by the Clinton - only about a quarter it would enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say this over their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters can be asked in an open question , why they want it to be the most important question that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by Clin@@ tons &apos;s supp@@ orter with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to dealing with the problems and the votes are quoted .
since the vice @-@ president is a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the Democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ tons followers more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far from being different .
if bi@@ den does not decide for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ cra@@ cies , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increases his lead against S@@ anders , from 20 points with be@@ ers in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 per cent over the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that watches it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important at one Can@@ didate , Democratic voters call questions about the voting .
similar to the last month , no single democr@@ at@@ ist candidate , or potential candidate for those voters of the elections are considered unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Can@@ didates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they look at the Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den , and tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy and strong guide qualities .
bi@@ den cuts the three candidates most with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that by S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have any opinions of him .
democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions embar@@ ks on Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ spoken minist@@ erial meeting , most of the Democratic voters of the prime minister are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public .
the half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one @-@ third is content .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , even though 36 percent said that their opinion of her sen@@ timent was worse .
it is mainly rep@@ ubli@@ can , more than six of 10 that say their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , they are still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the indigenous people also see Tr@@ ump and not tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes on leadership .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were best cut out of the six tested candidates for hon@@ esty .
a majority of S@@ anders rather regards to be honest , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the previous elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son caught in provincial survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is home to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times .
while the two candidates found half of support for voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support increases from 23 % in recent C@@ BS survey which was conducted before the Fox News debate last month , about 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son hits a good role in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass Tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can elec@@ tr@@ ons with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ es , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Director Scott Walker , who fell the deepest in the last month , with 10 % support in the last month .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place .
the error margin in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son counts in the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly outside Car@@ son .
with a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ ie@@ ves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze to ask Tr@@ ump in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday while hosting a campaign in Iowa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is presently up to 29 degrees warm .
although peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough to find hot water .
a bathing in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
here there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees is the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , divi@@ des the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic sea , there are 25 degrees in the top , 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood created with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a ch@@ ic@@ ant ritu@@ als in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder guests are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College of Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction to the hospital in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police split .
officers said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound backpack full of sand , and has been attacked , while trying to push over a frozen field onto a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g would have been power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Chief of police Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , conce@@ al@@ ware , began to hide the welfare of the Brotherhood , in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Chief of Police Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g added with sh@@ ump@@ y force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s added .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury Prize , a charges for murder of third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of crimes of criminal attacks and a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to blame for the persons involved , but when there is an organization that is - officially or in@@ official - this will also account for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College had out@@ la@@ wed the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood called up its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when F@@ ed increases the interest
an interest @-@ raising arrives , and the land@@ fill will fall into the wake , return to bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long this will last , and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story for the economy offers only small guidance .
a recession came in within 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and financial investments will react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank st@@ resses that investors can not concentrate entirely when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather in the period needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end , market participants could determine that the whole ag@@ itation was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on low level to carry out to seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to be feared .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no implications .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the pre @-@ interest rate of interest rates can make things vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to be rolled over 12 to 24 months after the initial raise , which perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years , mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to the rate hike , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 % according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chef de Str@@ ate@@ ge in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to occur later in the Incre@@ ase cycle and the return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and could speed up a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point at a rate hike of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 rates have been rated only twice the nominal GDP of just 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 per cent to the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and dis@@ card the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made all year on an interest @-@ raising of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , fut@@ ures business will only be a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all enh@@ ancements were taken from 1950 to day in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions , very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one had waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed revenue was also vol@@ at@@ ile , as the market launches an inser@@ tion threat , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
with bonds , the margin appear to change once the initial increase / reduction in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the enh@@ ancements cycle , the bond issued immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will bring that return between leng@@ thier and shorter bond will bring closer together and lead to a cancellation of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; highly ins@@ ati@@ ent bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s interesting , is Jones that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation running , there are a few signs that the market has adjusted to str@@ ingent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the amount of income is flat , lending and vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the big and whole , businesses who enjoy the greater part of their business activities in the U.S. should benefit if interest rates rise and more attractive products will become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar over@@ comes their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed the average balance sheet according to each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital return and low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality output by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising air .
as@@ par@@ agus could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are different , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ MP member of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its

&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading general member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything to do the private channel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ doms , Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC bos@@ ses that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ating &quot; and are increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dar@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just below another name .
so , if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director pointed back the charges and argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and give new works in order , I really think so important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to engage in getting the audience , as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element in the BBC production which , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dami@@ en Collins handle The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show that was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .

Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was as judges - &quot; shown in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was next time there was an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Internet sales grew in August at slow and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the spending in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of the main shopping streets in Great Britain have turned into v@@ ast@@ als .
however , experts say that there are signs now that new numbers have stag@@ n@@ ated , after new figures showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ated , after new figures showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and back until 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G @-@ selling ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the after@@ sales revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , however , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some merchant websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , who had fought the buyer for bar@@ gain , who could hold a purch@@ aser for purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending had been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines are now being operated more than one third of the purchases now via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of man clothing and shoes online rather than in fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mecca in the crane accident R@@ öt@@ ned - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 victims are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ eral in Mecca by the streets .
Saudi @-@ Arabia sets the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group to the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were taken by the streets to bury them , who were killed as a crane on Mek@@ kas large mosque .
trau@@ mas filled , dressed in white , the distance to z@@ ap their respect , when the first of the dead took up their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ ur cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession went to the Holy Place , where only days prior to the mosque of the mosque and then the bed collapsed .
the bodies were released for the bur@@ ial , when Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden account because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 people , who were killed as a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Bank of Mecca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to over@@ clock the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already declared that the H@@ add@@ sch is going to Mecca with thousands that will continue to go on to the city .
today King Salman , the Bin Laden group had not allowed to steal the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of Dek@@ art , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English language agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad must be prohibited .
beginning of this week , Salman discovered what the overthrow of the crane caused , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that takes place later this month , were gathered .
the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements on the collapse of the cranes , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree sha@@ ded the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not co @-@ operates with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by towers of Mecca as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes up major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before an arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officers said that 158 people were hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
government officials assigned to pay 1 million R@@ ally ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the killed workers and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other clubs get half of this amount .

Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree premium @-@ chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep @-@ prices , is out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which focus on craftsmen and close to 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
in the moment , men weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this stronger to a balance .
in general , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading companies listed by only five women at the top of a British F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also struc@@ ted their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is the only company that occupies 50 per cent of the team with women including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group was deb@@ ating to close the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faithful
on Wednesday , Kl@@ agen@@ furt &apos;s State Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt would have to answer two officials of Austria &apos;s A@@ I / DO@@ B &apos;s Austrian volleyball court .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
he was acquitted of his accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the State Pro@@ secution Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused were cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 schol@@ ars of associations , with whom they used in their functions to disp@@ ose for private purposes .
the damage is estimated with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euro .
the sports officials are also charged with financial crimes .
this fact was divided by the Chairman of the Sch@@ open@@ en@@ sen@@ ator , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ car@@ ding of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity was the case that the association came to no time a wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials only charged allowance and the sports club , which they had worked for from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the Pas@@ si@@ va was invested around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue our club or let us drive ? , &quot; one of the accused , in a hard @-@ house audit@@ or of the financial office .
with his colleagues and colleagues , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods as security at the bench , &quot; he said during the arrest .
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts .
moreover , in the financial year &apos;s financial success the payment of the allowance for allowance is expected back to 1991 .
therefore , I have paid a part of the allowance for years later , namely in 2003 when an Plus was paid on the account .
therefore , pause and not details would therefore appear , the former ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings were administered by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association have not been resolved in detail , the judge asked .
the club was not interested in financial account@@ ants , important to be only the debt freedom , the answer .
in 2011 , when a function@@ ary investigations against civil abuse began in 2011 , the amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was attri@@ but@@ able to the Club &apos;s account .
those were back , said the def@@ endants .
this paper account ran on the name of the second susp@@ ect , and according to whose statement was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
for that time , the question@@ ed had no answer .
then he thought he was believed to be the best for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the public pro@@ secutor did in the room .
to be informed , the compl@@ ained was the function of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why cont@@ amin@@ ating claim ? , they wanted to know judge and pro@@ secutor .
wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on , the first def@@ endant committed that he had not agreed with this wording , as the association was never formed any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer is saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
as far as the function@@ ary didn &apos;t relate to a cent salary , he only expects mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , the club was charged a 1,000 euros per month , but the actual cost was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
they were , after an operating inspection , where everything had been judged correctly and kept to be kept .
o@@ dom@@ ic had also related to the second compl@@ ained .
all the insist@@ ence being in cash before he had to go to the bank of the international market to Jar@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the witness of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard passes more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the ongoing staff reduction for three years , the Compu@@ te of the company will be able to abol@@ ish another job .
the Stell@@ ar@@ gets of the US computer terri@@ fying Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) contains no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients .
this will allow costs to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company shared Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has been ongoing since three years .
by the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year HP employs more than 30@@ 2,000 people .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian border
the Hungarian police has deployed at the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and a water head@@ lamp against several hundred infl@@ ated refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ v &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the issue of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees erup@@ ted the limit .
behind it a police line had been form@@ ulated and a water designer was standing behind the police .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , st@@ ains and plastic bottles by the officials .
the officials initially put continuous ch@@ ili spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have settled down now .
a pregnant and apparently pen@@ ultimate woman was carried away from the zone .
children , who breath@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried .

the time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is watching the US $ two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade , interest will be raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were question@@ ed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist slightly longer and the interest rates remained at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates down to NULL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank will potentially left the zero area and launching a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking view on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has warned the markets , pointing to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are of such a step good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday .
death squ@@ ats at the Delta State University deposited debt @-@ writing
after the shot and killing his girlfriend into Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague and killed later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb had a note to tell him that he could not admit it , &quot; he could not admit it , &quot; he said it on Tuesday .
police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social academic education at Delta State University , calling for emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He had shot on someone , and put someone to death .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency call that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house that will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably rather excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I might und@@ o it .
I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb has driven 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cru@@ sted him .
University President William La@@ un@@ ge said that he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb of supposedly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangles relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ish was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter , which is 19 , and it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ej@@ et worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a dog called Light@@ ning , who met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb returned to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police met him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb returned to the side , and fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed herself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded a doctorate label from the University of State University in spring 2015 , how his life@@ lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the corporation by
the Lufthansa plans a large group of companies .
in the year , Lufthansa will save a half billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the worldwide 1000 senior exec@@ u@@ tives will cost the jobs in the workplace .
with the pilot work@@ mates , there are still new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the restructuring was a profit contribution of around € 500 million a year for cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things there is no longer a board member on Lufthansa in the future .
the low @-@ speed Euro@@ wings sol@@ der are designed to be as stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly developed as possible .
in the board team around CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich yar@@ n will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future .
with the revised edition , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far the organisation of the 120 000 employees had strong company complex .
under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , the airline operates three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tariff conflict with the pilot &apos;s cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resumed after the min@@ ted strike on Thursday .
this shared the union with .
the theme of the convers@@ ations should be the retirement schem@@ es for pilots .

the conflict between union and airline has resulted in various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the trans@@ itional provision the pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the trans@@ itional provision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sees that Lufthansa &apos;s flights in the fight against competitors are lag@@ ging behind the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Shaw , Manchester United can &apos;t play for two months for double fra@@ cture
Luke Shaw suffered twice the fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one in the Champions @-@ League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven League .
while this brings to the left external def@@ ender for wines and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Shaw can play in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and placed oxygen before being admitted to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bass and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United to play , and then really takes place , and then it happens .
he had an oxygen level in the dressing cabin .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can re@@ play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of an elite escape .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not pen@@ ed the Mexican candidate .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian ump@@ ire had s@@ worn himself .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very gri@@ ev@@ ous attack with both legs .
Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
total : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat during the PS@@ V
the UK parliamentary report has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for France with the European Championship in France to recover growth up to the coming of June .
Phillip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg press when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly doing . I &apos;m so sorry .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also put into the hospital - after a blow by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost quickly .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a client of child@@ care systems , his favourite child@@ r@@ ens book decided to call itself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a tough choice , writes Cameron in a news on the website of the company super camps , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , touching , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give my children , as we have always missed a picture or message that we have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all well and good , except for the following paragraph telling the action of the book , instead of rele@@ asing a sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ em @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to capture the heart of Audrey , the girl of Audrey , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss became ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this is not suspic@@ ious enough : the text of Cameron &apos;s lyrics re @-@ featured , partly like the Sum@@ mary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ film , which is all artificial , and even the air a commodity is , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , has to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he is willing to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book , such as the local environment , such as the local environment , for@@ ging kn@@ ights , plat@@ inum , for@@ bear@@ ded creatures , that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said the lyrics might be probably from Cameron &apos;s Choice Office .
Super Camp affir@@ med that the text of Cameron &apos;s staff was supplied , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team , but it is still difficult .
in order to drive to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one chose the Ka@@ der , who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse win .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will bear no scars from 2012 , only a young@@ ster @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an unknown size on testing plane , an option for the attack .
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze as head coach in Yorkshire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eers are aligned with results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best cho@@ os@@ ks .
a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
when he knock out further courses for Yorkshire , a further chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , although he did not bring such good benefits , and this is not surprising ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test impact is receiving , to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got nine before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you can raise is that England first put everything in the Caribbean - as a ly@@ th in a maximum form - but this lost chance now is in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , which I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer , which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he achieved a job on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met very much .
it must be at least the same chances as those who are before him , but of course it depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of leaving Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , bringing a extra spin @-@ off and four j@@ icks would be di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a shov@@ el can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed h@@ anders have already shown that he is a devil &apos;s sk@@ ul@@ fan of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een also has done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my early team mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before coming to Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred pac@@ es instantly and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ viar as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may possibly look at his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball , and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup chips that raise their hands and the co@@ aches have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the squ@@ ad , England made a few smart additions at the co@@ el@@ age .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ one , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , served as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game which will bring an abundance of experiences since it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the changing cabin , even if the news stand in line with the previously announced .
Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some won &apos;t agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you have to think about how players depend on their jobs from their players .
such decisions are not hit by a slight heart .
the Bre@@ xit project ( Bre@@ xit = F@@ unding Britain from the EU ) could take a turn when the economy gets into a flood after 2017

Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside of the EU @-@ tent camp - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some capit@@ als have come to the point , in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for them , such as th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande must be on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a verbal force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they are trying to catch a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy should be better used to aver@@ t Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even plan out un@@ helpful comments on behalf of SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the re@@ trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; UK hasn &apos;t won any value from the re @-@ negoti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ umin@@ ously the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , but did not have it during the course of Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspiring refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2 : 1 ratio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak in Boris Johnson who have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ euro opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during all his dis@@ re@@ ty , Ed Mili@@ band knew who had his enemies .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ caring shr@@ ubs , phone h@@ ack@@ ers and phon@@ eme p@@ seudo @-@ member countries who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air really thought about them , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas give it di@@ stra@@ cted to di@@ stract him instead of lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more flat@@ ul@@ ous than Bl@@ air himself when he resist@@ ed his speech against the referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the EU &apos;s Constitution , which was refused by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which he opened a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him that .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly Kl@@ aps in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to conf@@ use me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott of the 80 @-@ s years , a mistake at that time and nowadays .
it may take long , but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I &apos;ll put it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ dy@@ e and the wild fil@@ tering of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television that week , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , won &apos;t admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John McDon@@ nell has been a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father sought to talk , il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet mates , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
help &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ &apos;s expression - was not what McDon@@ nell said about what J@@ C told his co @-@ struggle and de@@ pu@@ ties to all reports on their cl@@ amation on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n tries , remember that he even has touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important at the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of the Social Media , a brut@@ ality of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron doesn &apos;t have a free ticket for Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for self @-@ understanding as McDon@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental non@@ sense of EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist system - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic controversi@@ es .
as with its am@@ big@@ uous duties to Nato , Tom Watson , fel@@ ine convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign for the outlet - to try to find foreign diplom@@ ats to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all of this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was re@@ minded of the launch on Monday of something British influ@@ enza Security Forum .
expert critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful as smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to the tobacco industry .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) decides to crit@@ ici@@ ze them by the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; extensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the resi@@ li@@ ence of data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grab@@ bed the &quot; exceedingly wind@@ y basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers in BM@@ J are asking whether they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than that smoking is based on a detailed review of the reproduction and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement is coming from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for multi @-@ critical assessment analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously maintained by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 deleg@@ ates attending the meeting said means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in order to add them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also give industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research activities of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however there will be no such links or limitations in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence for so far that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long rob@@ ber@@ y dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to it , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty to public information on what the evidence shows and what does not , especially when there are so much public confusion about rel@@ ying dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80.000 people die annually at a disease with respect for smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clear pre@@ set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should quit East@@ ing@@ ders , a former leader of Channel 4
the former chair@@ person of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give up their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs broadcast not by other UK @-@ transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are likely to see public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disp@@ uted strug@@ gles against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to come into contact with the BBC for six years .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programmes would be on order or send them clearly from un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to hold the radio station , what I mean in the medium or long @-@ term idea , you should at least act on programs that are not doing or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class event , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this would show is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why finance a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think it would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC will sell shows like East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ne@@ ko programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can do pretty much the audience , but they can argue they can go on their seem@@ ingly sacred missions for a 4 billion dollar law@@ suit , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which nobody ever wanted to see it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather re@@ pres@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think all of you think that you get a great value for £ 150 each year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC will review their maturity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said just a few of the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and they should take an example of the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to question the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ators Alli@@ ances to make everything online available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ograms &apos; can control brain cell through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes changed the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous system , which can be controlled by blades of sound waves .
the tiny ne@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes alter the direction in the moment , in which they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , to be heard .
impul@@ ses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels to react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ograms , which can be used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain barrier , an inv@@ asi@@ ving method that delivers electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
def@@ ences are usually not re@@ acting to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made sure that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then inv@@ ade in worms .
the ultr@@ asonic generators work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es from some of the die @-@ cells .
the sound waves cause the aper@@ ture of this ion channels , and activate the cells that are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions do TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when he turns ultrasound to the different creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ wers and transfer@@ ring into worms , where they turn @-@ on mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ a , a ground@@ breaking tool enabling scientist to in@@ activate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ah could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be revealed on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound treatments can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily im@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells added .

the 300 posters are made by artists who have shown their work in the museum for cruel design in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ Mali@@ an .

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists have been dealing with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
a further of the anti @-@ arm@@ oured posters gre@@ ets the comm@@ uting in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the non@@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ mak@@ eover artist who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creativity director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence concerning the advertising for the arms trade - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic head@@ way , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ k the awareness of the sale of illegal CIA devices at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a member of the British Government and the guarantee that the warran@@ ties are not contra@@ cted from our door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art revol@@ ves around the arms trade fair dates from the area within Excel , where Ex@@ hibit@@ ors were be@@ ck@@ ering fantastic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab will release an order of the US Army via &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique formed scri@@ b@@ head , which delivers tremendous growth effects within the target range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student houses
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the terri@@ fied sm@@ iles that I have been sc@@ and@@ alized - and to many , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned is can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to the student residence is enough ner@@ able until absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ wat@@ ering : people tell you where you come , where you come from where you &apos;ve come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Van@@ m@@ ite neither love nor love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a He@@ fe@@ extract , haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it ad@@ ver@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those of whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people pick up and take their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship .
Intro@@ vert a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , yet many student residence halls provide a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship further , but you have to go away to get the energy I have used to interact with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him a SMS instead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ap@@ rop@@ os t@@ aps : do it .
a guy in my student residence kept the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship enclosed by baking .
since you begin the Uni at the high point of back @-@ mania , the knock is on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s . welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates will feel comm@@ ited to talk and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end of the time .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly missing cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep sleeping when you knock down .
food to steal , is a course of course in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are that they are saying to themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my emp@@ athy - but try to deal with that balanced as my fellow country@@ woman added to their milk a det@@ erg@@ ent to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , the people from sleep or away from work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being an decent person , but that you belong to people in the true sense of the ad@@ diction that are sitting in the glass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it is something special to them to make drum &amp; bass some qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and they had an exam at the morning .
she re@@ acted with still listening to music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly sent her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left their own music , stopped their door and went on to her three hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your sp@@ ouse &apos;s future wife would coinci@@ dental in the same student residence .
vice versa , it would not be di@@ stra@@ ight@@ forward embar@@ r@@ assing , if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses to separate themselves and then see them every day , and perhaps do it together , how does all the common friends go about ?
of course , the heart runs his own way - but if a hot person is definitely not your future wife , try to persu@@ ade your sub@@ mis@@ ed a little bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in a non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is f@@ ailing than it seems .
a good reason is funny , but it only takes moments to turn to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give yourself a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do not che@@ w someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then make in the freezer , but stap@@ le their bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , dozens of refugees ,
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds for people who do not have much money in the centre @-@ fr@@ at@@ orial corner houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need room furn@@ ish , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ val@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how you can do even today and well , &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in an interview
thousands of refugees come in the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in understanding how quickly the living space can be created : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds for refugees in a project of ter@@ raced houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : a mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain in such a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow we need sufficient living space in the next decades .
a completely ban@@ ister , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ raced house takes at least place .
it eases the integration process .
it &apos;s different to places people in living blocks .
each of the six Hou@@ ses , which are being built just in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then houses can easily be converted to each individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meter floor space per house is 184 000 Euro , excluding property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the construction projects fail to complic@@ ate their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : legally , I have correct my project correctly .
it always makes the dro@@ h@@ end Dam@@ oc@@ cl@@ es@@ as@@ que of special construction and the space system arrangement .
cre@@ epy surroundings .
it is still under@@ lining who manages three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their ter@@ raced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury systems for asylum seek@@ ers .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be required by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you option to download , and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after installation on problems , as they get an error message indic@@ ating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users recommend to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght gets lost or trying to update through iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to create space - but it will be easier to do this by adding a special tool to install apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your cell phone is charged while updating is charged or located near a load device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple is not leaving the update being continued , as the phone may switch to half way and it could lead to termination of the updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ch@@ ausen .
furthermore , council mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ et@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many villages there are missing physi@@ cians - As@@ endorf said to it : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in the 1st oc@@ tober .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ur@@ ausen enters the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich continues his successor in the coming months , with half a position to the side .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on the 12th October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy on the first sight , when the rock@@ ers met Frank Müller and whose wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll had met her medical training in a g@@ ild@@ ed hospital who also plans to get into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit nicely into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ch@@ ausen and laughing .
&quot; when it was time , I simply called them . &quot;
the idea also pleased the idea of putting their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss quickly .
and so one was agreed , the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , Frank Müller &apos;s two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up in Hanover , followed by stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen and in 2009 he was appointed a senior Physi@@ cian in the circle of Die@@ ph@@ rey and is involved in the DRC application of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ch@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern ) speci@@ alizes in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , wish to settle for building doctors .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we offer more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and resi@@ li@@ ence examination and need a talk room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of 500@@ 00 Euro received the Müll@@ ers as part of a grants program ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued &quot; , &quot; emphas@@ ises vel@@ vet ci@@ stern magazine Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients were born according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in which the north German average practice are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another private practice .
a positive side effect by Frank Müller : the Chem@@ ist remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no follow@@ er has found himself , it would have gone too .
whoever visits the garbage dump remains in familiar faces too : takes over the seven medical journals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ an@@ ej@@ ens .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the physician will have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ach@@ ausen re@@ members himself .
I feel a bit arro@@ gance after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the inter@@ ven@@ eer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pushed myself before the gardening process , but now it could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high up on our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to give asylum to asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the background .
however , it is clear that there would be obvious signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the people need to know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had announced before@@ hand that Slovenia would continue to travel to Slovenia and Germany to continue fighting some cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not how the Minister of the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach had not seen this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather monitor the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is considered as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians wants to remove its borders for refugees but not factories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any EU member must complete his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government has divided , the first refugees have been tried in the night hours to Tuesday , to travel in Eastern c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police nur@@ sed them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles always meet new refugees .
it is mainly used for Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
lif@@ ebo@@ at and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said .
moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were transported to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ically @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far . Croatia and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade did , however , that it is the way people refuse to include certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus had arrived in the early morning with some 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling all night from the Maced@@ onian border from Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police said that we should travel here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
now it could actually be a shift postpon@@ ing the existing Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the Balkans .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister for Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible shooting situations for the fall of refugees .
details did he not name , but he pointed out that Croatia worked as a non @-@ Schengen Member . &quot;
they perform rig@@ orous controls through to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently established a good report on the country since then , which affects the standard border controls .
on Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports they had the past night at the border crossing which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two boundary passes of the Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves want to travel on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried all Wednesday at a local ey@@ es@@ ight : he stop the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently take a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers sh@@ orts migrants to - dangerous - alternative rou@@ gh@@ ten
however , private hung@@ arian workers have already begun to distribute the refugees , on which altern@@ ate routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ hazardous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there still un@@ cleared min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ ality was on a volunteer , she immediately reported it and was in the foundation in 1995 .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight and higher costs in its ground sports agency .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share was posted over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts at a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ was expected .
the lower view resulted in spite of the price increases , which will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of higher ampl@@ itudes for heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that earnings before the previous year may be increased due to costs , higher recei@@ pts and growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when compar@@ ing the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later than those of the rival UPS , who is planning to deposit 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as in the previous year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of C@@ acks Investment Research and question@@ ed analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts of six of Z@@ acks were expecting an expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
over the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decrease in international priority shipping , which brought sales in his unit Express Mail to stag@@ nat@@ ing .
but the boom in online shopping has increased its results by F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher payments due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight industry .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares rose by 3.@@ 85 percent , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Com@@ strateg@@ ist spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time ever since almost a decade .
dro@@ h@@ end above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ floor sitting sa@@ vers is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues put out the economic interests of the nation before any other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : Maxim@@ izing the US Employment and Prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive net interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy indicate that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets that already intensi@@ fied F@@ ed representatives will intensi@@ fy their vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest for federal bonds - and be it only around one quarter of one percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important of what they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economics at the Mak@@ ers of Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text that was not increasing the interest rate , increased in@@ security around the global market is enough just@@ ification for waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is doing - uns@@ ure on himself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who recently asked about Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate hike this week .
the financial markets however expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists will sm@@ ash the blow by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average average rose by 2@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ Politics uph@@ olds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she should go far too far in her statement to re@@ ass@@ ure the financial markets so that they should not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that the financial markets would calm down the financial markets , because they act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would take action .
yet another month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow growing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , that this year , despite the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed to raise an increase in the set .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement of the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage subsi@@ dies have shown evidence of a recovery .
and although inflation was steadily under the top target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives had said that the main reason was a lot of lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world ends up in the end of the last month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score fell by more than 16 % in May when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market recovered slightly in this month , the Dow now stands at almost 10 % below the high level of May .
for F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the turbul@@ ences impact the complex calculation , when interest increases the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events were not occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low on the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of in@@ security about what impact on the US economy will be and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is not one of the principal values of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed can do its mon@@ et@@ era expansion . &quot; moves away all around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed representatives can not only monitor the developments at another place , but also with other central banks and experts will consult a better understanding for global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art than Science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ac@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has created a history of over@@ reaction to financial market movements which apparently doesn &apos;t be linked to economic bases data . &quot;
in 1998 , L@@ acker , an official member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an interest rate , cited choices in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leader by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives did rever@@ t these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis as in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said to a member of the Committee for interest in the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest @-@ raising , because the markets inspire them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not think they should predi@@ ct the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little aid for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany in these days .
prepare a warm welcome , doesn &apos;t go without the engagement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support endless asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they are among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul teacher .
she also teaches with her 74 rooms .

there they will help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , that &apos;s quite different from working at a proper school .
Brazilian China &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nour@@ ishing nutrition and healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , that give babies all the nutrients that require them to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic fit that should carry out mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exemp@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be used for solar installation .
the plann@@ ings for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gym construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ park come step by step forward : in the recent municipal council the worked building contract was blessed without great discussions .
previously , the board also decided on an application for an identical &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid identity plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went to permit a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ otic first and roof over &quot; is meant to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the planned use of the roof space for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get together wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it went again to the roof ti@@ lt , which is prescribed for energetic reasons - different than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof pr@@ unes is no &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council in the rule of liberation calls rather restri@@ c@@ tively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project at gy@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a predic@@ tive incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym lifestyle at the Sports Centre is a community project between the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ier .
about 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itude transportation .
the next proce@@ eding of the building will be submitted for the 18 x 36 meter size hall to the Land@@ rats .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of associates move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au River .
this is what the surprising plans were confirmed by the Land@@ kreis Hospital of Land@@ kreis , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on the meeting is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23rd of September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the plans are to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority are to move by fishermen and the continuing in@@ existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered at a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
staff are informed of the plans .
the resign@@ ation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , is now entering a private practice close to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the question of who will succeed , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take over from the 1st of oc@@ tober and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in every case and a spread of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180@@ beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
as an exception for the next two years , Fischer is said to have his team , if the Supervisory Board is to agree , both houses will lead until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ella , that has still over 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after just 140 years .
it had previously planned for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation department is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Board of Directors , was contrary to what the house which is owned by the Federal Office , in future , should be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several refle@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short term care in Car@@ itas and a tag@@ onal sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could us do for us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fisher@@ man about the ha@@ zi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a doctor for more than 30 years , I did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was over and over again in the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and birth assistance .

a susp@@ ect took the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old started to have killed the young people and had sum@@ mon@@ ed their bodies in a channel in rock breaks .
a 16 year old missing old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a victim of violence .
the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern of Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as Pro@@ secution and Police on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acting as a writer , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man arrested the fact stated on Tuesday and led the investig@@ ator to the location of the corp@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having previously agreed to go home on the evening after visiting a autumn in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in looking for the young woman , investig@@ ators first took on the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ lies .
in case of question@@ ations in friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances there was a crime committed against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged off@@ ender introduced the police to a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen where the body was found .
in consequence of the arrest of the arrest , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed the authorities and put the corp@@ se into the channel .
on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be lead to the o@@ at@@ elier and the investig@@ ators lay a burden to him .
the conclusion of the closer relations is to bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of residential gap
the location in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees seek a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution events in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people push for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this result , a study of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was commissioned by the Association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees were no longer oblig@@ ated as asylum seek@@ ers to live in a first purchase accommodation .
many stum@@ ble across the apartment market and rows into long lines in front of the flats .
according to Statist@@ isches Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only on the increasing number of refugees .
the study also provides considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that is increasing by year to year .
currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas around 7@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compl@@ ains about 7@@ 0,000 units .
so many educated workers lived in large cities in residential rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the cities the number of square metres per capita has declined for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves for social housing are to revi@@ ve the social housing .
thus the purchase taxes could be abst@@ ained and the basic tax for funded apartments will be suspended .
moreover , the alliance will need attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities .
the Kf@@ W grants programme now works well in towns and mun@@ icipalities .
a good week after the launch was published on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available € 300 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are a hall@@ way
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , virtually no more penet@@ rating , there are always more refugees the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the North without any hur@@ dles .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian inner minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen Area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the sealing off of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people were on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports on the RTL radio broad@@ c@@ aster .
Hungary had sealed its limits for refugees at the day before .
new laws , coming up on the same day , persu@@ aded proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police launched the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you arrived both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees reach the border .
this limits other dangers : there are still sharp mines there in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , little refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police was 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before Tor@@ ah on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws revol@@ ve over@@ coming and dam@@ aging the border as an off@@ ense .
therefore , 35 prisoners were initiated in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted def@@ endants were up to five years and deportation of deport@@ ations from the country .
according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , transferred to the newly appointed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ pointed Parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 seek@@ ers , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would still be 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to turn up .
they gathered up the tr@@ ash , leaving tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side last weeks .
the block@@ mol@@ ars were dismant@@ led and one of the recording measures in the mar@@ g@@ inal resort was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to speak for the goal of this Umb@@ rian .
according to the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
moreover , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but to the 20,000 migrants , however , the country was still in the country .
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing we met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drove &quot; stre@@ ched &quot; over the border
&quot; after the bridge ceremony on Sunday we were busy as suddenly ten people were standing by traveling in the tent at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to move by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprising because of the refugee flow in Austria because of the refugee flow in Austria , the Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the scattered along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Middle Pass@@ au .
before@@ hand we have made the unused guests only once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages .
we have said right away , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; of course that was for us , &quot; such as the City of O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation , 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very happy for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train pass were re@@ acted on Sunday evening in Wels by one ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , to order it after the short @-@ term announcement of the train to Germany , but still try to talk about the border .
the regional train was taken off at the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge ceremony joined the Bavarian neighbours together with the Bavarian neighbours every Sunday , a two @-@ bread - organised by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us more thousands to us is a logical result of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ critical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help in the erection of structures , the Human@@ ity has officially committed suicide and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government in the community of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now faced in the boundary areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the poultry ones will have to conclude that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has invited them and welcomed , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a major challenge facing the continued number of refugees and of the coming winter , in order to produce human conditions for protective search . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ .000 winter coral
Konrad has to do all hands with the refugee of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to stop lo@@ dg@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre for Tra@@ is@@ kirchen have already received a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ piece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; cra@@ cked situation . &quot;
the company expects a total of 8@@ 5,000 lights in a fier@@ y year , with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 amps .
in order to meet the number of times , there will be 35@@ ,000 accommodations for the next weeks - 20,000 to the countries to provide 15,000 the wai@@ st@@ band .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; Konrad said .
he has already led discussions with the governor .
these should have secured him , even for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; he runs fine in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born that will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations the asylum @-@ coordination is also put into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform Private individuals can offer private accommodation units .
it is also hoped for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency it could not be that lo@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must stick a certain height of the cab@@ inets or size of cab@@ inets .
for a temporary period of time &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry who is more successful , Konrad established himself with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further in the face of truth .
being of persu@@ asi@@ veness is his main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic to explain how they declare themselves .
they want to count on three to four .
so far , their own lo@@ dg@@ ings have not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously issues with permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
first no opening of municipal sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not currently necessary , as the people are currently able to bring these measures without these measures , says Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for emergen@@ cies , further sites on their exchange are to be tested .
criticism by the organisation of the organization of refugees within the Federal State .
other areas must also make their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders will not be sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ag@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday made further progress on the refugee question .
See@@ hofer gave me assured that the German borders are not sealed .
the further travel of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the relevant border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany won &apos;t give it any more .
however , the prot@@ ections were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other EU member states demanded more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria does control over its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the progress of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New shi@@ pyard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT company S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is expected to be le@@ ased out by young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in the start@@ up companies of the New Shi@@ pyard and later also raising to acc@@ ru@@ sion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T will collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T to the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Federal ( FF@@ G ) .
the building operates from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2700 square meter floor space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ il opened second store in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in focus in the new shop .
originally Jutta was wanted to get a dog .
this project had to sort out the 49 @-@ year @-@ old woman of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally it has now been growing in the form of another business loc@@ ales .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in front of the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , now everything is about ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets and wall@@ ets .
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
a couple of weeks ago has been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only people that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been widely planted by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am looking forward to most if something developed and I can show new trends for affordable prices .
why such a woman in a look of a beautiful hand@@ bag , she can also not answer the woman with her last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is utilized to every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the fal@@ si@@ est ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects man@@ holes with billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for himself .
whether he expresses alien@@ ation , journalists and knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the campaign strongly .
and cut well along well .
this is also registered in the state town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents come from the property of the property .
the New Yorker with F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept called many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ dirty corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers talk about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe they are somehow thrilling , but are not so deeply impressed by the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native town of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous spro@@ uts , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family , Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
true , it &apos;s respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - at high @-@ German : the gi@@ ants says she says .
so , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
cor@@ nerst@@ one of the property company was the first plot of land in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from Tra@@ gic : her desire to return to his homeland for the time , failed on the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz had belonged to .
he did not capture Tr@@ ump , because he once was without permission , the director of the Institute for Pentec@@ ost@@ ical History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the film &apos;s film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
in contrast , this is in contrast with the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of the desc@@ endant .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the US and asked the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ gh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the polar , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a related k@@ m@@ ist called Tr@@ ump , who was born Op@@ a was born to Op@@ a .
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of the city . &quot;
the pension fund Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter mentioned , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz Family was to don@@ ate something for the church organ , which was generally good anchor .
&quot; I cannot imagine that of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would be better if not willing to gain the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has such radic@@ als views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who have had the failure at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. , he would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and what President ?
&quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , for the Tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 children , even in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
the Upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ ör@@ fer . &quot;
in neighbouring land , the local alpine club is in charge of awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; is allowed to have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of its area must be designated as a protective zone .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son reviews to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no great shifts in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast Show of Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ st@@ ine managed to run Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , went to London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs to which Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un belonged .
this dis@@ advantage of insur@@ rection seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7,000 viewers in the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9,000 .
today , today , a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number left behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed mystery ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have evi@@ dently clear who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , eventually found out with Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left girls will certainly not give up whether she is the last rose .
but when we checked out with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows a day before three of them will be checked , you may acci@@ dentally put a reference to who will be the winner who wins .
Sam Wood with@@ holding his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have left out in ly@@ rical fashion , why Wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude to reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to play per@@ is@@ hable who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went to the house and ( s@@ s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt pretty compatible , and I thought it was all over the show , &quot; says Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah &apos;s feet on earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
in their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made you clear that Wood &quot; could be the One .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is not just a game - I now set off to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they asked whom Wood choose to , if not they , then she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL games .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent by their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches had banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost a pol@@ angel as it did the Aussie @-@ Rug@@ by League Fac@@ tors in Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded in his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also into the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also showed his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
rather than gr@@ ind the ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport reporter T@@ one reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to over@@ take his pat@@ ron@@ age cat@@ ching and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , in a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota kings
certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ ologist for his N@@ FL debut were certainly hoping for .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble @-@ chat the playing field and later told the Australian Radio designer Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not have a worse start into his N@@ FL racing career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the be@@ aker with his chron@@ icles back then in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters call for the number of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees in Bavaria .
part@@ isan and group leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger war@@ med at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn foli@@ age in large wall@@ s. in front of a severe crisis in Bay@@ erns schools : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get tests on the Bavarian image system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the typical local elec@@ torate has failed to last until fri@@ day in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
other main themes were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject will super@@ impos@@ e asylum the clo@@ ister , &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger said .
Ai@@ red@@ ana called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as they gave it during the Yugoslavia @-@ war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we must move to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible .
that is why Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded even more personnel for the administration that is responsible for asylum applications : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum approaches , &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW leader critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need consistent standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is shooting down , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we must act responsi@@ bly . &quot;
however the local policy in major wall@@ ets shouldn &apos;t fall below the table .
one year long long @-@ lasting is on the agenda : the image policy .

that , however , does not go far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; the FW @-@ boss said .
we want freedom of freedom for all the high school students who want this .
free drive at G@@ 9 everywhere if desired .

the discussion around bur@@ dens resulting from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the R@@ WE &apos;s shares into a record deep and also left deep scars in E@@ on .
according to &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros .

the shares of the two largest German energy companies re@@ covers something , but ultimately they lost 3,@@ 31 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd that demonstr@@ ators opposed to the proposed new constitution , said a public on Wednesday .
the force broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , executive team officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police have rap@@ ed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then fired into the air before returning to rubber .

it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ fin , of which is known to be killed , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously produces such a high death rate .

the project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the planned houses on the small sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor was publicly presented to the project for the first time .
several an@@ ists are still anxi@@ ous - they fear the selling of their activities refuge .
for many months the closed doors had been negoti@@ ated , de@@ ver@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday complex at the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the firm , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den corporation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; exhibited his plans for the first time on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like some other project critics , he would strongly suggest that traffic would be greatly increasing by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus@@ h@@ ings must come to this effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz
what is happening on the well a hectare site in the former inn , is still open .

Google launches two @-@ time Don@@ ation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ rise Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign , which aims to help thousands of refugees who will have over@@ tax@@ ed thousands of refugees , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of a donation call for his blog .
instead of rele@@ asing the announcement we wrote Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kabul with her family , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; for our journey a lot of dark web and bus@@ cru@@ ises , equally hunger , thirst , col@@ dness and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people look for help like my family .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million at a value of 5,5 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has been displac@@ ed more than 4 million people this year .

for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of loss @-@ loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss may live longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that has an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A .
weight loss @-@ operations or obesity , use various methods to size the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity has proven to be an efficient treatment for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out with people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , whom they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric acid and stomach acid - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those under@@ going this operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those under@@ going surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the Diabetes was completely dissolved in comparison with just one percent , with only about two percent .
moreover , results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , and of the &quot; poor &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better found in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , and found the authors out .
the researchers also monitors the patient level of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers are writing .
according to the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass @-@ Surgery Group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 14.@@ 2 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people suffering from obesity , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone said , it is re@@ ass@@ uring for persons with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have too long wait until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic alter@@ ations , having tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the UK in his speech at the Opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the response of West European countries ad@@ mi@@ ded to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he empha@@ sized that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the use of violence has never solved such problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terror attack on 11 September and issued that the violent reaction of the USA came to a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put out violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
qu@@ anti@@ le increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
tox@@ control centers in the USA reports an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , swal@@ lowing strongly alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , the Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues in children increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going on in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant to drink while some people do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are drinking only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have report@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ades .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , wine grapes and orange du@@ ft that are very pleasing for children .
pendant inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children , a few spr@@ inkl@@ ers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency call centre in Kansas City Hospital , a Fox 4 transmitter , in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let down whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year @-@ old girl , that recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es taken after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was taken into a shelter for treatment .
their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered in@@ tox@@ icated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who handled it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept through her words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors assured them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at a sign of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ms Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ odi@@ s mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has introduced to parents and teachers , to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were dis@@ infected with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect the product meth@@ anol had a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher being poison by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and appointed them from their space .
the police stepped up the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because the leader@@ ers are not there . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .

why I will be a witness in Oklahoma ?
somewhat later , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen if I sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the Gi@@ ft@@ sprit@@ ze .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day moved closer , I started to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applicants than places available , a mak@@ eup Lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oklahoma has quite reduced the number of media areas from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to tell me a notebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma did accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she is still thinking that it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a rep@@ or@@ gy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Podcasts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would have found him guilty of action .
but I think that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , to which you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man &apos;s unnecessary death .

the C@@ anning V@@ ale Po@@ liz@@ ist was dry when he was speaking the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attempted man of Perth , to leave the police , was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale police was rec@@ alled on Tuesday into a peac@@ ekeeping incident in Bec@@ ken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , they tried to escape to C@@ anning River in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make its Uni@@ form wet , so he turned a reliable tactics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny stuff to try to escape , &quot; he said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins left his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to attach him and threat@@ ens to end the racing game
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he focused on Ste@@ wards and the Integration Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment with the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions while it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ vor of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he could not explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy it as too much of a hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long to eat it , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that all will come out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it far@@ ther .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live on what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to be lifted head about the head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best .
if they begin to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
earlier , Moo@@ dy had made a bomb in an interview with Sy@@ ing.com that the Integ@@ rated department had tried to evacu@@ ate his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ an Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart will be staying in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem , obviously , that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if that is the case , they should certainly be able to sei@@ ze their n@@ oses , because they have failed at the attempt to gras@@ p me .
Robert Sch@@ le@@ ston , former Chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ dy , said President of the RU@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the RV@@ L have been cra@@ ving up and make people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
so am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I arrived at the point , which doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and they urge to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the training levels of the trainer have built up the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching carried out that he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could put his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ released Master Black Ca@@ viar , called the Rac@@ al Treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay has been applied to the horses that pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is oppos@@ ing the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so late evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also like that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be cont@@ acted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with a pack on the race day . a study of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ ucci with ri@@ vals to ring fighting against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy said criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee have allowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ co coach Wayne Bennett didn &apos;t che@@ w a huge note about the Storm team , after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that she just concentr@@ ates on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident , because it means that they were worried about being fought out of the Storm Team .
&quot; that always appears again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring competitions , when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; says Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es at a real centre and this has been the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit like a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this always emerges again at this time of year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy encouraged Benn@@ ie &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ mind@@ ing his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ie St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our play Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; says Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George has been critic@@ ized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and what we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he did this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as these .
I build more trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not have thought of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ ucci also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster proved a higher result than the match Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t looked it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and do not earn a score ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase still .
the Storm Team has been free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final round at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts from the next morning .
Serbia with a 200,000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ age
a man who may possibly have a lifetime punishment because of its su@@ cking to have s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that have been s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , have been set free for a damages deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the afternoon and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite an possibly viable penalty for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the coffee could have been harmless .
judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the sent@@ encing , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety in order to achieve his event@@ ual release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the impos@@ ing explanations of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from being warned , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set free against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ ides his Australian and Serbian passport , le@@ ak each day by the police , and at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driving home ri@@ ps apart
a truck driver had seriously injured a truck driver at a dri@@ ve@@ way with three trucks on the 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday night .
two of the three wag@@ ons participated in a permanent place in the direction of Basel .
the third driver observed it too late and tried un@@ am@@ us@@ edly , at the last moment to sof@@ ten the police , as the police force .
the squ@@ ad of the accident caused completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed from 6 hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ yo@@ y to send images
a ped@@ ophil@@ us employed the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell , log@@ ically received himself in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of continuous pictures of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked after it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web investig@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used for searching for in@@ appropriate images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the At@@ tor@@ ney Ei@@ li@@ wick Roberts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ iff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction that he is ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching for the computer was carried out from him , but he said it was done to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten a polic@@ eman .
he was asked for his discussions with the unknown individual who sent his pictures and asked he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his mind when he drinks and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Roberts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone her mother called her and was on the trem@@ bling and on the cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then looked on the un@@ related images on the telephone and confron@@ t@@ ted the def@@ endants with them .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty on the meaning of the indictment , in@@ constant images of children on 14 June last year to exp@@ el the charges and not before the court appearance on 24 March this year .
Secretary @-@ based Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the Register of sexual off@@ ences , since they could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his off@@ ense .
Sher@@ iff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael w@@ asting the verdict until October to sust@@ ain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case but was held in temporary detention for hear@@ ings in other cases .
it was taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locks lines on small border trans@@ itions to Germany from &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees come out of the huge control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many locks made from fear of discovery and capture people increase to smaller border trans@@ itions .
on the Austrian side , a speaker of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 fug@@ iti@@ ves were raised in the districts of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn .
they were walking over bridges and sho@@ cks to the German side .
at the reception they are placed in reception and for@@ warded to the registration .
at the Munich Main Station , more than 40 refugees were once more refugees when compared to the market launch on Wednesday .
until 8 pm , some 700 people have arrived in the capital , a spokes@@ man on the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border the city reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : front of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
Meteor@@ ologists war@@ n against storm birds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure unit over Western Europe , warm air air currents in the country divided into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong t@@ ief is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who had moved to the Bermuda Islands in recent days over the Atlantic .
heavy storms and storm are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , Thursday is still to be in the Black Forest , at the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake Constance with bows 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
the sun is therefore closer to the sun on Friday .
the mass turns it : every two years , the motor@@ ways show their innovations at the IAA .
the year 2015 is mainly due to the movement of compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
at present , cars from compact class cars are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ str@@ ations fell by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( exhibition stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic design vehicles and new Ober@@ k@@ las@@ se@@ - and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the largest lines for the German car industry is Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ pped by dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume model has also been sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel is introducing a start @-@ up below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is already only five .
as a second variant , I will follow the spring of the com@@ bi which is already at the IAA .
and what will come up next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Car@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a fifth in a conventional and a st@@ resses sporty GT @-@ version .
in the stores it comes in the beginning of next year , then also as com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan monitor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts itself fully into the design line of the brand with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : it is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the bal@@ eno market launch in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ and@@ er put in front of everything in front . here the radiator shell was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed above , reducing the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play is integrated .
at the IAA in compact class , a number of super@@ structures and new variants evolved like the freshly re@@ bran@@ ded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel Minister of Justice that was found in a small cell for months .
because of violations of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
by the German Constitu@@ tional Court , this decision had a decision on Wednesday .
those affected could even hope for money if they were imprisoned for only a few days in the closed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ mate with his constitutional adv@@ ances in Karlsruhe was successful : it was housed in a single cell with around five square meter floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
afterwards , the man who is now on the loose foot rests on the loose , was laid back in a greater cell .
his official arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy arrest of arrest against the Berlin Land .
but the Constitu@@ tional Jud@@ ges with@@ drawn the judgment of the Berlin chamber court and referred the case to the second ver@@ ification .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Chamber Jud@@ ges now decides on the amount of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though for legal reasons , a few days of liability for the compensation were decisive for the compensation , it was an appeal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be responsible for the protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the level of dental damage .
the Constitu@@ tional judges have often raised the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ment compensation in April because he was locked in prison in the prison cell .
degra@@ un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , even the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , furthermore , the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , which had a prisoner in a parallel camp , confirmed a decent housing in November 2009 .
then the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had taken over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in an equivalent cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had been hit the head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even in killing itself , because due to the ten@@ se situation it should already come .
according to the judicial press , 21 digits are not covered in Te@@ gel for young def@@ aults , 19 of which are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor decided to take it up .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to come to Germany following the guidance of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany , according to Deputy Prime Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge . &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany will give the following overview .
demand for various progn@@ oses is between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the pest@@ le institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is being built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is especially at affordable prices : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 welfare dwell@@ ings from a rental price fall out , and in order to apply these particularly favorable j@@ ars will also apply to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bundes@@ Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 Socialist apartments would have to arise and therefore the Federation should invest a funding in amount of 6.4 billion per year .
schol@@ ars and the Federal Council of the Federal Council agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Occup@@ ational Research , 55 percent of the population fled to Germany can be employed in the long term .
yet , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to assist them with getting started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has been a political turning point : from work pro@@ hibition for refugees to recognition of work .
while there was a work ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential spotlight , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to one place .
in society , there is - also because of the lack of business - mostly the view that refugees to enable access to the labour market swi@@ ft@@ ly .
lack of knowledge is required for the access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most commonly medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the development of networking is , according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , to the pinn@@ acle of employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School of Berlin has found that only few poultry parents give their children to the kit@@ as , roughly 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the root @-@ root parents &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is only very important to stick to the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ dam@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration took over in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise steep@@ ly by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of the training , by making more skilled schools .
in the countries students without knowledge are prepared in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate Un@@ lock from the Berlin School of War .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ate the study - the only exception was Berlin , the sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now abandoned his position .
school permits refugees could be facil@@ itated from the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or termin@@ ology do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er law more if they start studying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter usually won &apos;t have BA@@ fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the bureau@@ cr@@ atic individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for BA@@ fö@@ G to be eligible for 15 months from January 1 , 2016 .
but this gap must also be closed , to Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually re@@ consider the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state religions .
it would also be important also the creation of a Islamic benef@@ ici@@ ary that is profession@@ ally taking care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contacts and are willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give some control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes read@@ iness , controls over religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts can also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to stran@@ gle such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to comp@@ ile the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the integration will be much more important in future than today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the majority society must also change the purpose of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a close decade , an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general principle of gender equality law .
but lear@@ ns very slowly , how the NSU M@@ ord@@ serie show@@ c@@ ased the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal chances for all : what migration organisations and the stak@@ eholders were to demand for a long time and for what international agreements are to be effective in the coming years , if the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens must use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally Germany is able to provide medical care so far , the physician heads Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands that all of them should be har@@ med at the registration health cards .
these services could be rep@@ lic@@ ated later to the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited range of performance , which fore@@ see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise , doctors mainly do the language barriers .
until now , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved that migrants are po@@ uring worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices , they would have to pay interpre@@ ting charges .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among the refugee children there are about significantly more un@@ treated disability , and with young people , it is about HIV diagnosis .
however Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means the German physi@@ cians to come with the partial different clinical pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attack or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the medical adju@@ sts , it may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , and some refugees are even doctors .
to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly bl@@ ur@@ red tests .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Employment Services ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress reduction or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee kids , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
whoever is ill at a post trau@@ matic stress problem is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ovascular and death .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , severe and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
to date , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy .
indeed , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for Psych@@ otherapy , but the processing takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental disorders , would decide whether the therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mal@@ assess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream

&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and juni@@ ors .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this them@@ ed them@@ ed the current management stage .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
so the gift of the gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 27 year old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with World @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; as Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , states his concept .
this fl@@ air can now experience 50 cities on the barely 3 000 km tour .
the program of the Circus convinces by talented artists from around the world .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
problems in the attitude of circulation are only too often related to different animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes his position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go well with our animals , it &apos;s not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents participate in each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately named , will be read from the eyes upon request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the ring either .
the top@@ most commandment : providing good for the animals .
especially on its Zeb@@ ros@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of sh@@ all@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the family is also proud .
the two animals have lived for eight years in a pen and nothing happened .

Sim@@ bab@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holding false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of this year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also de@@ pressed by de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as proposed by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
in the past month they had sh@@ attered him and interrupted him during his speech at the Nation Address ( Parliament ) - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politician SMS messages received on their mobile phones they were warning to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number which is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns that the Parliament &apos;s members , that ends the imm@@ unity in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament that their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers facing politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard is able to reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later emerging in two listed companies and will separate computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a strain of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and profound portfolio of businesses that support companies with transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; is focused on delivering un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it is divi@@ ding a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard and Dave Packard , where the Palo Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure through to master the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta tells that team mates have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger empha@@ sized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it &apos;s only September and if his rehabilitation runs for plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario indicates that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly won at least the next four games for England , and his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ les infr@@ in@@ gement , and then back to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not risk the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
there was a bone , which was not good .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries which he had before .
this may be true in a medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation conducted by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of Arsen@@ y 157 Lig@@ els in the last five seasons .
the bro@@ ader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs used to record most of the r@@ allies .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time to strengthen your body and gain mar@@ tial power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope , his body stabili@@ zes and I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of nature that he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea du Saturday and for Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a press within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are not going to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to allow a small break from bre@@ ather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites , via Gruppe F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake that was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled the lesson from last season with the champ@@ ions @-@ league @-@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never folded in Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Day : the com@@ edy show , which grants us serious lessons on men &apos;s friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations shows in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even desper@@ ate than ever before , such as self @-@ rate rates may prove to be among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more common in men than women .
in the efforts to tackle the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ mann ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a p@@ iti@@ ful life ) 2015 is the year of a man , with the aim of stopping the culture in question , helping men to seek assistance if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms determined that when the pas@@ sions had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual friends avoid the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once , so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on substance is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have doubled the need to be strong , lifel@@ ong , and successful , even though the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ical values provide ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which imp@@ acting on our mental health much more profound .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was on the face .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the humour of jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in football , in cozy , and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to every case , even if they are often back to discover completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone calls it told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my ro@@ mp@@ ing role for people who feel depres@@ sive and self @-@ risk , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can cope with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term loading mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friends .
so much my objective external Sem@@ iconductor status via the phone can also help people in moments of despair , which is long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the occasion of celebrating the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help mal@@ qu@@ ate Malmö .
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his match against Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League matches on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game account and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö on the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of the Champions League de@@ pu@@ ties than PS@@ G players , who brought the French masters to their way , but after they finally climbed up their lead when Cav@@ ani posted a head shot in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , since they do not only strive for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic officer of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed chance in front of the gate . he was later started in the game against his home team and against the club with which he started his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to capture home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause our opponents to cause problems and relax , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I am un@@ fortunate that we did not yet have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at their own place for Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean imp@@ eller was named as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United States , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö Defence department before he graduated in Johan Wil@@ and on the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this stage , joined the stage with nine national players in the field , and a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid @-@ field hits a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they mar@@ ot little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself appeared sometimes on , with some patches with flaws , not least of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was in no less than five trials in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill if he took his poker player into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , that Di Maria was transformed into a shooting shot , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the p@@ oo@@ rest ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er made his sixth part of the season after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had left a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts about Malmö in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low as the replacement of the ze@@ qu@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was replaced by an end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualification table does not range . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented him in 2008 changing to FC Bayern
world champion and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played in Barcelona for FC Barcelona .
eight times of Spanish masters , three times winner champion , four times Champions @-@ league champion , two times European champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona in 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi disp@@ at@@ ched that he already stood at the age of Euro 2008 .
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and that is also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a choice of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ el@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change came not .
and the crucial man for this today works for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola without contract and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP told me that I wouldn &apos;t change he could not imagine the team without myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has got me . &quot;
who knows , as in the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the entire distance on the grass , out@@ dated the red ones ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the reign of the Kings .
Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in the movie
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ american film maker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
while a result from the Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actors Brown , when this was the need for alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the shooting of the film and not at the line up of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the comments of the actor managed by The Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Mon@@ keys and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - like the figure of the harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is beaten by its white sugar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists of Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , her direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded in dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about the only black person in space , so he can tell her variety - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 re@@ tra@@ ets and 4,000 ri@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time , at the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown has been killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement of Black Li@@ ves achieved a nationwide effect and urged the authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against paint levels .
in February , the singer Prince made a play@@ able for the movement during the introduction of the nominated @-@ winning albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quietly , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black lives , albums have still their meaning .
more recently , guides of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the Führer .
recently , Dam@@ on was announced that Dam@@ on was used on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the west .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ t first champion
the professional sport@@ s@@ etter Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could close all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the finals .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot rock climbing in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he completed the first athl@@ ete , the most exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! breaking news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 dollars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed was talking to The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all , not just receives any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets with the quick@@ est time , &quot; We@@ ed said .
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he ob@@ tains the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s doing anything about it .
he is just so lucky to have done what he did .
crowds of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they have changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended to compete for a com@@ edy season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers will pass on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tiger are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to her role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
T@@ wins had a chance to climb up for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz to Ascension within a play of the Houston Ast@@ ros .
for Detroit , although only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that had been so difficult to summar@@ ize about a large proportion of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad H@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) met 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; Simon said .
it is difficult to throw at the Bull@@ pen of each game , and so I want to go deeply into the game .
the newly designed tiger sh@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , its first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ day hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits from Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; he has sha@@ ken the striking wood , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better from the Bull@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear end of the seventh angel , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bass speaker Brian Do@@ zier about the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy went on wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was confronted with the designer Roo@@ kie com@@ bat@@ man Miguel S@@ ano who gave a two @-@ run for the square @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ w .
for the second , Ver@@ ena brought the third bass driver to a double play with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run .
it was the major league leading in the major league for the 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ les struck a double play .
after Detroit opened a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth , the Wall brought an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the closer to the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed s@@ ach S@@ ano with three pitch for its fifth Save .
in addition , Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers saw three rings in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which was painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after having been missing more than a month for a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning , whom I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better than I started and felt that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after she received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ un released a single version of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abol@@ ished his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bass driver Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single run on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed on the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins &apos;s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not drive well , but he got the right job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hughes were found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Hughes , there were three hits with six hits and one walk with four stri@@ k@@ et@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was retired due to an off@@ ence of the wor@@ rying short@@ age .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who was working on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , from mid @-@ August on the account of the po@@ ck@@ down list for a shoulder @-@ duty , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez de the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the vulner@@ ability list , to start his T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four star@@ ters with the tiger , since then he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
it has been excav@@ ated on the right hip since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at the target Field on Wednesday .

hundreds of refugees to arrive in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
people are then to be accommod@@ ated in not@@ if@@ ications in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden came on Tuesday evening .
it projected an estimate of 450 to 750 persons .
several sport halls of the H@@ essi@@ an capit@@ ol have been prepared for this case in recent days .
there can be temporarily signed up to 1000 fug@@ iti@@ ves .
they will then be distributed over other mun@@ icipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to figures for the first recording government , Gießen had received 7,@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have set up staff information in Spor@@ th@@ alle , because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the final thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective history . &quot;
four years ago , one would have been happy that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive expansion of international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced inspec@@ tions to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared the Austrian TV station on Tuesday evening .
Germany has not sent refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
according to the question of an agreement on which Germany may take a number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , has already given interviews on public security and representatives from Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Baltic route from Hungary .
their goal is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , sought a special summit for the next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states haven &apos;t seen a common progress in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers wanted to take a new start on Tuesday ( 22nd September ) for a new attempt to attach further 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states in the suff@@ ocation and distribution of people .
this league will manage this in common with the countries announced on Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the prime minister in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need to protect them also .
but he who doesn &apos;t have any thought , could not be in Germany .
this view was impres@@ sively divided in the round .
the pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; huge force . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border from Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania along with a fence .
this neighbour is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat trips across Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the plan to respond immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had inc@@ ited the fence .
in Turkey , most migrants are reporting that thousands of migrants are on the way to the Greek border .

&quot; that is hard for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to re@@ consider now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to its slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively high sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
healthy are still healthy : these exotic fruits still are : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os contain much Vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta car@@ otene .
whoever eats the fruit , strengthens the immune system , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or firm and sm@@ elling .
the shell @-@ colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos are delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and will be consumed within a few days .
they then taste pure , of course , or in sweet food .
a man@@ go gives a special note also a sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
they alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste radic@@ als such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ons@@ lau@@ ght , then Mark@@ ante cold front
in the next night , in the valleys of the night@@ race north of the F@@ öhn blo@@ ated through how Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z broke out on Tuesday .
on wed@@ nesday and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn blo@@ ws with the wind strength by the gro@@ oming pe@@ eler .
after the sigh@@ ing of th@@ urs@@ day morning , we crossed a striking cold front , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature return .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest exposure .
on the Alpine side breaks in the night on Wednesday of the gro@@ aning across the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blo@@ ws up to Thursday morning with the bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the jungle , partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to reach until the adjacent middle of the middle , and in the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on wed@@ nesday F@@ öhn blo@@ ws for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degree , the moisture down to the night@@ stand starts to st@@ ow away .
here , rain stops , which lasts up to Thursday night .
in sum , South of the Alps must be reck@@ oned with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours , after which had already great crowds in recent days .
on Thursday morning , the hair dryer to the air off , rolling a cold front with a strong , partly hum@@ orous rain from the West to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind picks up momentum to stormy , and temperatures fall clearly back .
the following days are present in the north @-@ autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German reform@@ ator .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome beside the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the church community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ isch @-@ Luther@@ ische Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pope could live for centuries as a minority in the confin@@ ed of their faith .
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) proved to be a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he experienced the city then as a sin@@ ner sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions should be encouraged by hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Russian Church with his thes@@ es .
Hammer Group spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main buildings painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for its bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ rust has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who has now appeared with gorgeous pictures now .
at the beginning , the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has expressed his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical hist@@ ories on paper and canvas in 150 different designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagination has given the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the relevant topics , it can quite be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many theme areas of the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All Books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles created are cycles that are dedicated to topics like cru@@ is@@ ks , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity .
spont@@ ane@@ ously , he has fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is based on the basis of painting with the respective passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and so in today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal trem@@ ors of Al@@ ert painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are nest@@ led between Martin Luther and one set of the artist , both expres@@ sing his personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewel has golden cou@@ sins .
at the same time , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions eventually became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that listened to the severe Protestant ruling .
&quot; the education already came with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop this in order to bear me with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in the fastest time again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is st@@ amped today by advertising and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being driven out there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always have something secret and aren &apos;t decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt aims to let the viewer slip into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bring them back , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for his object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost last Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in der Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art . &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot;
I have not considered the Bible to be wholly owned by the Bible , but the theme chosen for him as well .
&quot; it was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text explained merely . &quot; there is a picture of the pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life too deep and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bible ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition dedicated to the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation on November 15th .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , with an excellent character in the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the changing situation in Germany and ensures the politics to help the tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can tell the principle that nothing is going on me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; that must be a lot of interest to get this subject in control , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Sch@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the State Minister &apos;s wife Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; so the theme will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football can and help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs should issue politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German S@@ occ@@ er League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to increase four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nir@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;

reports : SAP Board of Directors lost an eye for accident
the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports by a fall in early July .
after the accident on the stair@@ case in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water@@ bed to midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ shot , he was just hau@@ led up on the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under @-@ Fo@@ under @-@ Fo@@ under &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; in early October , we are meeting before the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was involved with the meeting and &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software gro@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP since , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : femin@@ ist in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes are made com@@ eback to a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player is missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t rely on him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen the Bv@@ B @-@ coach would be open : &quot; we count on Friday with a return of his training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his pros , Tu@@ chel is unable to change his ancest@@ or position only at the R@@ EU@@ s position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of k@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher , pra@@ ises the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ chel said openly .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the search statement of fellow players R@@ EU@@ s that the Fin@@ al@@ rede@@ emer for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League must be the target of a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
rob@@ otic cars : government wants a leading role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a tra@@ il@@ bl@@ az@@ er after the will of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Affairs Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Auto Show IAA in a &quot; new mobile era . &quot;
automated driving driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , who will also come together with representatives from the IAA .
the transport paper of the transport ministry is empha@@ sized by the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and digital radio broad@@ band .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be br@@ ushed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the per@@ missible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will also ple@@ ad for a change in the Vienna Convention that so far only sees people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver will more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still dri@@ ver@@ less cars are expected to be expected in public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport authority S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical about cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on Wednesday at the AA @-@ Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the Prü@@ for@@ tification Dek@@ ra comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be successful in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect more than 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents relate to 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
anyway , drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a data collection in Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to leave control during the entire voyage on all streets .
at the motorway , it could only imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good of all , the car would not leave control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team - and double start on ping @-@ p@@ ong
by now , in the title of the title , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will fight with the title battle from 25 September to 4 October only in single .
the final decision is to be dropped by September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough not to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , B@@ oll found itself on the long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China for the long term .

&quot; then Timo Scheider has been missed , and we have become European Champion . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it &apos;s a mix of quite large shows and a wax figur@@ ine Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday .
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the striking creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in flo@@ ats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the enf@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be a bit earlier , but now it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th September in the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed its initially flat attitude towards a show about his personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition opened a little to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits show an insight into this man &apos;s hon@@ orable work , which has written the fashion history without ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a brilli@@ antly chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete work , for which much effort was used to promote the dolls , has been specifically engaged for a styl@@ ist .
14 tons of material have under@@ gone the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gaul@@ t@@ ers old Ted@@ dy , too , is also present in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , h@@ ag@@ ious , swe@@ eth@@ n@@ ering experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he dressed up his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the dis@@ card of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier , in Munich .
I then bought it later .
for his first own fashion show he can &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ush tip as fashion niche
previously , it went on the long embroi@@ dery in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips rose in large amounts for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ isan Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the Pl@@ au@@ ding Head , fashion played a larger role , was then driven out by the Heim@@ tex@@ ting industry - and it is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories and on regional trails .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which ref@@ uses to classi@@ fy an increasing potential .
for those who are not used in the textile branch in Germany , no longer is on the market anymore .
with us they already make half of the jobs .
Mo@@ stly Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ ded tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been taken away .
private stores and also the wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products hardly reach our products on this path .
today , mass needs are produced a lot cheaper in Asian space and is sold almost exclusively over chains .
in addition , export to Russia and the USA are also weaker .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association seeks also to score by environment @-@ awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer ac@@ qui@@ res the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially actively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
Fritz Schmidt specialised in the Schnee@@ berger branch of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in bak@@ eries and sp@@ ikes .
in order to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , we need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which have to think economic especially economic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ produce the historic snow le@@ ver .
the machine s@@ no@@ ds at some places in some places .
the pl@@ ums in Gold@@ smith &apos;s master , Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se , was inspired : &quot; previously I could not start with traditional pl@@ aten . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of pl@@ ums - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the US , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in their ancestors in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and want to remember .
this way I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for pl@@ ush tip .

according to the &quot; Entertainment event , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but to play a kind of sequ@@ el , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magical kid &apos;s maid .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI is looking forward to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must be wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday in a group which was commissioned to reform the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should start to l@@ ure up foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a speech at the 16 meeting of the Central executive group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to enhance new spin and reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to regul@@ ate the market access , relaxation of the border checks policy , promoting the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the statement , a negative panel is created , the sectors and companies that are not question@@ ed in investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is crucial since it acknowle@@ dges the market an important role in the al@@ location of resources , a right @-@ state business environment , and the market open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government is also urged to lo@@ osen controls over which powers are over and ensure that companies do business as they lead their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors will open further areas for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect legal interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and deliver better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by keeping the application optimized and the application process will be reli@@ eved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also took part in Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and major leaders such as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus raising its consumers with significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ Watch , who is an appropriate working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects are not passed away with impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve by the end of the food chain like Hai@@ - or S@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy grounds &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big pre@@ dat@@ ors are already bur@@ dened with mercury today , that on the basis of still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the length may not be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the border values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be available .
in contrast to F@@ ood@@ Watch , the EU wants to extract the threshold values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ Watch recorded this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ on@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are keeping the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore a per@@ fi@@ des of di@@ version that assi@@ sts in the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal which strongly attacked the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Federal Government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low amounts especially in the un@@ born damage of the nervous system can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry agre@@ es to its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endang@@ ering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets primarily through the coal combustion inside the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal power stations spoke out more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume in Germany issued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , mercury in fish have already been to the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
