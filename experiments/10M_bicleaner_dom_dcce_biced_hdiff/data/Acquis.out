II ) Information about plants are limited to the minimum level , which is subject to the application of securing measures in relation to core material which is subject to the backup policy after that Convention .
C ) In search of the community the organization is ready to check investment data , which considers the community to be particularly vulner@@ able to the premises of the community .
this data does not need to be superior to the organization , unless they remain open to the organisation in the premises of the community without further access .
a ) i ) The organization brings the consent of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the States .
II ) the community rises either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at some point against a given claim , so the organisation of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternative names .
&quot; &quot; &quot; III ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursuant to the repe@@ ating of the fellowship of the Community , the Council shall agree to the organisation according to this agreement , the Council is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the following as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the aim of meeting appropriate measure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) The community and the countries concerned will make the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation actually can provide them according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up so that i ) the possible rec@@ ess and interference for the community and the states and for the inspection of peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ y and other providers of the organization for knowledge to be informed confi@@ dential information is ensured .
every state is opposed to the organization , including assets , funds and funds , and against its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the privileg@@ es and liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the backup measures in accordance with this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to core material , when the community and the organisation determine that the material is consumed or diluted in a way that is no longer usable or non @-@ refundable at the point of view of the safety measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community not@@ i@@ fies the organis@@ ing of this agreement to pass the transfer of core material from the States , which is subject to the backup policy after that Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the backup measures in accordance with this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient is planned to take responsibility for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization leads documents from which any for@@ warding , and , if applicable , the res@@ application of the backup measures will lead to the given core material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core material that will come to this Convention will be used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , as agreed to the community with the organisation of such a material , under which circumstances the backup measures after this Convention can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
II ) that the candle will not be used during the duration of non @-@ application of the safety measures following this Convention on the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es .
B ) The organization and community meeting a regulation for ensuring that the security measures within this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , such securing measures will not be applied as long and under what circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the security measures agreed in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation will be over the total amount and composition of this material in the state or the states concerned , and over any for@@ warding of such material from this state or those states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; but it extends to matters as under @-@ time , and proce@@ dur@@ ations for reporting , but does not include a budget or under secret protection , and does not refer to the following use of the kernel material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization , community and states carry out the costs which each of them contribute to the implementation of their respective obligations from this Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , the States , or people , are subject to their test@@ ers , but extraordinary costs due to a particular search of the organization , so the organization advised these costs , if it has been declared in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization bears in any case the cost of all additional measurements and sampling , required by inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and states ensure that the liability for nu@@ cle@@ us damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations for the purpose of conducting this agreement in the same way as on the nationality of the states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any claim to the community or a state towards the organization or a state for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , which is incur@@ red from carrying out securing measures in accordance with this Convention will be regulated in accordance with international law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council insist@@ ed that the organization has not been able to verify that the organization has not been able to susp@@ end , if any core material , which is subject to this agreement , can refund the reports provided by Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if applicable , the provisions provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C can also apply to the designated other measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these steps of the Council , in which mass was achieved with the applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - each represented opportunity to ensure the required safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have the Community and the States or organization within three days after the request to an arbit@@ er , the Community or Organisation can seek the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point out these arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if within three days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rators , the fifth arbit@@ rator has not been chosen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of members of the arbit@@ ral tribunal is compl@@ ac@@ able , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration Court shall be binding for the organization , the community and the affected States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( a ) This Convention enters for non @-@ nuclear weapon , the contrac@@ ting party of the contract are and members of the community are verified , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organisation is not@@ i@@ fies , that its procedures are concluded for the coming into force of this agreement and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) When the fellowship of the organisation not@@ i@@ fies that it is able to apply their security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the method in carrying out the provisions of the part I via securing measures as required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the safety measures contained in this Convention is the timely discovery of the de@@ fle@@ ction of significant nuclear material for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ es for unknown purposes and the deter@@ rent of such dis@@ agreement by the risk of premature discovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to en@@ rich@@ ment the targets used in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as the backup of basic importance , combined with the spatial intervention and the observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical conclusion of the after@@ mat@@ s by the organization takes place by an explanation in which for any material image zone , which is shown for a certain period , st@@ ating accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after carrying out its review , the organization makes Article 3 full use of the pre@@ f@@ use system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following manner , and if necessary , see how they are given closer and practical are :
( a ) a measurement system for determin@@ ing the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost , or in other ways from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the stocks ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estim@@ ation of measurement un@@ certainty ;
( C ) procedures for determin@@ ing , evalu@@ ating and evalu@@ ating differences in the measurements of the sender and recipient ;
e ) Proce@@ dures to assessment not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system designed for any material image zone and the changes of this purpose , including the one and ex@@ its of the material image zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this Convention cannot extend to material in the mining or the arch@@ way .
B ) is used to Ur@@ an or th@@ ian @-@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fire cycle , in the states , the community of the organisation divi@@ des the amount and composition of the material , if it is not used specifically for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) is leaving the core material that is suitable according to composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is established , or will this core material or other is introduced in a later phase of the nuclear waste circular material into the States , so it is subject to the other securing measures in this agreement .
a ) The requirements provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community is subject to the view that the recovery of the core material , which is not possible or desired , so consult the organization and community over the application of suitable backup measures .
B ) The tasks listed in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in article 13 , if the organisation and community determine that this core material is virtually non @-@ refundable .
upon request of the community the organization exemp@@ t the following core material from the safety measures following this agreement :
a ) special material , if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is dec@@ ei@@ vable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ ation concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon request the community exemp@@ t the organisation core material , which would be subject to the backup measures otherwise , from these safety measures , if the whole , based on this article in the states , will no longer exceed the core material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates with multip@@ lication of its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium ( calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ed core material with core material that will be processed or stored in accordance with this Convention , will be processed or stored for the re@@ application of the security measures on that material . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets the organization of supple@@ ment@@ ing claims that are necessary to determine the successful and effective author@@ ization of the organisation according to this agreement , in detail how the procedures contained in the Convention shall apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supple@@ mentary agreements may be changed or changed without changing the agreement between the organization and community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supple@@ mentary agreements simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the coming into force of this agreement . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the force of this agreement ; an extension of this period is required between the organization , the community and the states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization is based on the basis of the initial regulation of the entire , the securing measures of this Convention on the basis of its origin , ir@@ respective of its origin , and leads on this existing directory because of the following reports and results of its post@@ pon@@ ti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and their Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special editorial team based on the conference for international economic cooperation , to help meet the immediate demand of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled by general res@@ ent@@ ment problems .
C ) It is the target of the EEC and the Member States that the entire of the Member States will be bound within six months after coming into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after coming into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will allow it possible to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and Organization have cons@@ ulted the other about the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the connections , to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC has presented a table out of which it is evident in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation establ@@ ishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special editorial account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which consists of the member states in accordance with this agreement as Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in this capacity , the organization is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , and shall only be specified in this agreement as determined by the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special shareholder account is separately and separated from any other accounts and activ@@ a of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment will be made in the form of cash or non @-@ ins@@ ult debt seem to pay upon request in the currency of the organization as an administrator of the organization as an administrator of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B ) Payment takes place in two install@@ ments , and indeed i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . the Beit@@ er within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
II ) the second part of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at another time , the dead@@ lines needed between the EEC and the Administrator , agreed for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state can afford payments to the above @-@ mentioned terminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ste@@ ward takes the usual procedure of the organisation about proportional things to cover the cash or the school , in order to cover the expenses for the special loan note and the special editorial account in a reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the guarantees of this loan , the administrator can lead to the EEC &apos;s conditions by the following factors :
III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic issues of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the trend of the debt service of the country and its further l@@ ending capacity to loan conditions without reduction ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special loan note serves the financing of a clearly ris@@ ky and fast @-@ paid development program ( including an v@@ aul@@ ted development of development ) , regardless of whether the organization and practices financed by the organization , which is intended to be taken into account of the proposed goal of the pre@@ am@@ ble to take into account the goal of the addition to this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organization is to be tied up as part of a loan or creative audit , which has been approved by directors of the Bank or organization on the day of the entry into force or creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from section 4 , special provisions will be subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally accepted by the organization ; therefore , they are rep@@ lic@@ ated in ten years of age in 50 years .
special loans will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are rep@@ lic@@ ted in these currencies .
amounts to the payment of this property are directly attached to the organisation which re@@ tains them .
any special loan agreement is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the administrator , in which the source of funds is stated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recei@@ pts from every special loan note can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient or services that are established in bz@@ an ; ii ) in developing countries , which has been specified in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , which may be determined by the ste@@ ward at the time of loan loss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds will be returned to the Special editorial account and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a membership fee is returned to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the administrator has instructed the EEC to fully proc@@ laim the EEC as well as for testing by the directors and programmes authorised by the directors and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the time of the withdrawal loan , the Administrator is taught by the EEC to the development of special loan loans and the expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as possible , the EEC transfers the EEC as soon as possible after finishing the financial year with a statement by the external audit@@ or of the organization to this account .
after full payment from the EEC as soon as possible , the Administrator of the EEC as soon as possible can report a detailed report on the projects financed by the Special shareholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator created and manage suitable records and billing , from which contributions to the special shareholders &apos; accounts recei@@ vable in the account and from the account paid amounts and the return payments to the Member States are evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EEC and administ@@ rators are closely related to achieving the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represent by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full edition of the funds from time to time , exchange programs , projects , projects , and above all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .

in order to conclude that the agreement is agreed in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of the Annex A of the protocol ( 1 ) to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) :
between the European Atom@@ ic Association and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Association , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , listed below , &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , listed below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program covers the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a joint venture according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Agreement - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been working for several years with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma and is perfectly familiar with the area concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion of the present agreement , it lies in the interest of the contract parties to avoid unnecessary over@@ cutting and their respective research , which gained higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is to avoid any contrac@@ ting party in the area of controlled nuclear fusion in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and the joint aim of this research work , i.e. , the joint aim of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ level competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear power reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve the objectives of the present agreement , the parties defined their respective research programs in Annex I and II of this agreement defined by the &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure a effective cooperation , the Swiss program ass@@ umes long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified by Article 16 of the present @-@ hand organs , that it may include new activities that are relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
every time , if the contract parties take a new program , this will follow the program of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association assigned in paragraph 1 is realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the contractual parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - Exchange of staff among the participants in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has signed a similar agreement like the present agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated third states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as well as the laboratories which work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- mutual right to access to scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the framework of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project J@@ ET .
regarding the implementation of the association agreement concluded in Article 2 , 1 of this agreement , association agreement , called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; Association of Association &quot; in regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland is involved with the time of entry into the agreement on the promotion of personnel ex@@ chan@@ ts , which is signed between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Personal@@ exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is now owned by the joint venture of the Common Company J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute they accept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom contributes to the contractual partner of each contract , except association contracts or other similar contracts , which will be concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organs , which are commissioned to carry out the association in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement , in particular , belong to the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to monitor and to monitor the development of research and so that best results will be achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about the trade with hamm@@ am - , lamb - and goat
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hur@@ ried to establish the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations regarding the import@@ ation of Hamm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of regulation on a common market organisation for hamm@@ ers - , lamb - and goat cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the plant@@ ation of hamm@@ ers - and lamb is exist@@ ent according to the community market and in particular according to the community for the New Zealand &apos;s economy , that the normal Par@@ agraph shall not be imp@@ aired with hamm@@ ers - and lam@@ ding flesh on these markets , I will propos@@ e to propos@@ e the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is made for Hamm@@ am - , lamb - and goat &apos;s g@@ ums to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of his hamm@@ am - and lam@@ b@@ ular is not affected by the application of regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to ensure a perfect functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the set @-@ up amount does not exceed the set quantity .
the prescribed amounts are executed in the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community assured that New Zealand should not be prevented on this agreement to use new technological developments and maintain its compet@@ iti@@ veness on the market of community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , consult the two contractual parties to find such a change in clau@@ se 10 in clau@@ se 10 , to find appropriate solution .
for the event that the Community takes up the protection clau@@ se , it is committed to safegu@@ ard the New Zealand &apos;s interests in this agreement .
in the case that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantity , the community re@@ tains the right to asser@@ t its imports from this country .
the community committed itself to re@@ strict the exhau@@ st@@ ion on imports of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem .
during the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will changes in clau@@ se 2 fixed amounts due to the extent of the New Zealand trade with any new member state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loading loads for these new member states are sti@@ pul@@ ated in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be charged in clau@@ se 5 stated test@@ rate of the exhau@@ st@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the total volume in clau@@ se 2 is determined with the tag of the accession of Greece to the community at 245 500 tons of battle @-@ body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the normal Par@@ ish Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ac@@ ic in the communal market within the agreed quantity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the community meets pre@@ ferences , thus the paragraph of inter@@ ven@@ tional foods of frozen meat is not under@@ mining the goal of this goal .
in addition , the two contractual parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without danger to market stability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agreed that every actual application of re@@ plac@@ ements or other funding measures are carried out only at prices and conditions that stand in accordance with the existing international obligations and the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in New Zealand , the compliance with clau@@ se 2 stated in clau@@ se 2 guarantees that there is no licence @-@ licenses of these quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community obli@@ ges itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ing of import licence for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned products is given by the template of a license license which is designated by the government named by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are set so sti@@ pul@@ ated in the position of a security deposit for the creation of the import license for the question@@ able products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of implementing provisions , the competent authorities of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have also given the amounts for the export license ; these data may be imposed on the destination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the outlet is worried about that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly works .
the surplus regularly checks the tendency to the hamm@@ am - , lamb - and goat market of both parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets , including conditions sti@@ pul@@ ated in clau@@ se 7 .
the outlet is worried that the proper use of the agreement is not affected thereby , that products are made out of hamm@@ ers , lamb - and goat &apos;s flesh in the agreement not called tari@@ ff numbers , according to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shot bl@@ ends all the questions occurring in carrying out the agreement , which are presented by a contrac@@ ting party , and recommends the relevant authorities appropriate solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement shall apply in@@ und@@ am@@ aged to the rights and obligations of the contractual parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume set in clau@@ se 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of income in force of this agreement will be set at the end of January 1 . January of the following year , the amount of the yearly volume is set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community will be applied , and according to that contract , on its part as well as for the New Zealand area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this agreement will be in force on 20 October 1980 . according to this point , it remains in force , subject to the right to termin@@ ate any contrac@@ ting party . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be confirmed by a year prior to 1 April 1984 in relation to changes that they are needed for necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will propos@@ e to propos@@ e to propos@@ e your government to agree that this writing and your anti @-@ password must form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
