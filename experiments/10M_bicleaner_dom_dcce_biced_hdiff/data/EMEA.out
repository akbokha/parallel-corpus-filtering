the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in the study , as the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) has carried out the studies in order to reach recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you need further information on your disease or treatment , please read the package block ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tray ( tablets , which dissolve in mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . work thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disease in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients that have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of un@@ rest un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral receipt of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or to use the melting tablets in patients , which make the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
patients who use other medicines at the same time are degra@@ ded the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication to the nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably known primarily as &quot; partial aggres@@ sion &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol means such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and Dop@@ amine , but in a less@@ er degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter seems to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder plays a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms to be prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared with two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo who had been stabili@@ zed in 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms had been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from increased un@@ rest ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment was investigated .
the company also led studies to investig@@ ate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablet and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than those who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , vom@@ iting ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting ( gra@@ vit@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting ( gra@@ vit@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ severe inci@@ dents in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol in which the risks were overweight .
moreover , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injec@@ ting solution in rapid control of un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al problems with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if a oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the European Commission of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for immigration of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients that had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered , if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is placed in combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ encies belongs to psych@@ otic conditions and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have increased risk of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sens@@ ory drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

if patients were treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patient signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn in vom@@ it , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ n , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be ab@@ orted .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with scrat@@ ches in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are linked with var@@ ic@@ uous sei@@ zu@@ res .

a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a Mag@@ ic acid blo@@ cker , decre@@ ases the resign@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be similar dos@@ ing reductions .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ ur@@ ities of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabolism .
if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects , and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dos@@ ing height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ za concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation regarding the human being and due to the concerns relating to the animal &apos;s re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence whatsoever .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ akia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .

in another study of about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
increases C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo patients .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , in@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no death sequence .
although no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol has a high level of plasma integration .
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance relating to the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in vitro showed high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 rep@@ in@@ ator and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week of Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 % of the Respon@@ sibility patients who contributed to study medication , similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depres@@ sions scale showed significantly higher improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ole group and at 57 % were under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients was involved in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5,@@ 6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo @-@ I @-@ disorder .
in a placebo controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ interference , with or without psych@@ otic traits , showed Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol a placebo over placebo in week 3 and a durable effect that comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also reported a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psychological features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension of over 74 weeks in some cases , Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ole showed a re@@ mission compared to placebo for prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ union , mainly when prevention of a bi@@ polar reaction .

the average eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in case of extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours at &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ nic@@ ism or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pro@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) demonstrated no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ it@@ ality and behavi@@ our@@ al disorder , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement of behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the median improvement of the starting point on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement component was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ ations , a similar efficacy in relation to overall population has been observed , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a dimin@@ ished patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , there were 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine .
consider only the patients that were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , in relation to the effectiveness of the disease and survival , there is no difference between drugs .
however , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
it may also not be used in patients who have low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ thal@@ mic treatment in the blood before the start of the treatment .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment was no longer a drug , effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , drugs must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 : the European Commission of Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited issued a permit for the traffic of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and is not shown for a standard Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

for sen@@ sor@@ ial neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 the treatment is to break down to a better degree of grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients suffering from kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data of the un@@ question@@ able and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ bon@@ ding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be considerably different pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated once again , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the plat@@ el@@ bow has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified with Abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac occur@@ ences are not unusual , especially in patients with early Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients receiving Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and form @-@ up means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or pregnant women , which do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in high @-@ grade age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable processing method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after the treatment no child bear witness .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm serv@@ icing , as it is possible by the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the per@@ il@@ ence and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important events of adverse events listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most distinctive hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ c@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are outlined in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy occurred in every dose and indication of studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that stabili@@ zes the mer@@ ging of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ ations and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their de@@ hydr@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ b@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies proves that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport by g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ in@@ recept@@ or is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tumor occurs .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous blind@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III clinical study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ ventive reaction to prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an aff@@ ecting overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ als .
14 % of patients had previously had no chemotherapy yet , 27 % had only one ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and to ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for sealing on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 therapy courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmaceutical application of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the resulting dimensions ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to an intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma centr@@ ation took place in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching external distribution and / or soft connection of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ al properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el has been compared after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) and a solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ ories is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - with two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value of less than 1 % of the total total dose of less than 1 % of the metabolism of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , resulting in a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor which has experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to in@@ ject into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his advis@@ ory person , if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control in front of treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and ice @-@ resistant should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems may cause an@@ emia caused by a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or caused that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell where a gene has been introduced to a gene ( DNA ) that enabled it to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection as an injection of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks prior to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ bin@@ ation of patients , which were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , were given to the same extent as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ raine , mig@@ raine , head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and effectiveness profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for medical specialists in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Drug P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg to permit penetration of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the whole European Union .

the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron man@@ gel ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , with planned greater operational intervention , which require a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) .
as a reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to be used in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fu@@ gal applications is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 m@@ l. can not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentrations lie between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
adverse symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ glob@@ ins to more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin results can occasionally be observed in one patient or under hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is inc@@ lined by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the lasting hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ bin@@ is exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ etin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be super@@ bly monitored to ensure that ep@@ et@@ et@@ y@@ fa is in the lowest recommended dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ ab@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients , in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients , in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be reached .
patients should be super@@ bly monitored to ensure that ep@@ et@@ et@@ y@@ fa is in the lowest recommended dose which is required for controlling the an@@ tim@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &apos;s value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ g@@ inal number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained daily from 150 to E. / kg three times a week or 450 i.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin increases &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ lo@@ pri@@ ot of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ lo@@ idal cy@@ ten@@ ant increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained daily from 300 to E. / kg three times a week .
in contrast , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ bin@@ is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ lo@@ pri@@ ot of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ ass@@ ort@@ ment of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves is required , Ab@@ se@@ wed in a dose of 600 i.@@ E. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to operating procedure .
iron subst@@ itution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood @-@ ende@@ av@@ age program - so that before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy there are large iron reserves available .
6 The recommended dose is 600 i.@@ E. / kg ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa , which once weekly has been given weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the surgery ( Day 0 ) .
here , ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis hose over the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in circulation .
patients who have ill in treating any Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin on a er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ plas@@ ia , PR@@ CA ) , should not receive an ab@@ om@@ ile or another Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stro@@ kes within one month before the treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ i@@ be@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stly known ven@@ ous plat@@ el@@ bo@@ lic ) .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater electrical don@@ or procedure , the application of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated by an aut@@ olog@@ ous heart disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , peri@@ ph@@ ic disorder or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently received heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of a antibody ass@@ aul@@ ted PR@@ CA to mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin .
patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand on trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated for non @-@ contact ( ice @-@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminum fl@@ ot@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ pri@@ ot value is normal , taking into account of an@@ emia ( i.e. , &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 , or &lt; 0.5 % ) , whereas the plat@@ el@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ - and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ ten@@ te are normally found , and if no other reason is detected , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin @-@ anti@@ bodies should be considered by the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed for patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 If patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the recommended limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin al concentration in paragraph 4.2 .
in clinical studies , increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events have been observed when er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ y symptoms , when hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin concentration on the control of an@@ tim@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required concentration is increased .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or dust @-@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the recommended limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin al concentration in paragraph 4.2 .
according to present knowledge is caused by treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are still not di@@ aly@@ ed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency does not speed .
for cancer patients with chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of therapy efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ ct ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ie@@ conditional an@@ a@@ emia - dos@@ ing value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risk considering the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vision@@ ed for a greater electrical orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure , if possible , prior to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who receive a greater electrical orthop@@ e@@ tic procedure should receive a reasonable risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ turally diseases , especially with an underlying cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ ular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , Epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that they enhance overall survival at tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of the tumor .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received chemotherapy lead back when a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stre@@ amed .
when ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis needs to be adapted to the increasing hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ e .
in @-@ vitro studies on tum@@ our bodies there are no clu@@ es on an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cul@@ ine events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial attacks , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ als and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin @-@ Treatment , so also patients under Epo@@ etin al@@ fa , reported .
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ turally events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treatment it can result in surgical patients with cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ular complications .
the gene@@ tically obtained ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and regarding the amino acids and carbohydrates are identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , which was isolated from the urine of clinical patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ ks@@ ary cells that ep@@ et@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimulates the er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ ov@@ ese .

survival and tumor properties were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ oms , statist@@ ically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant Human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treated patients and inspec@@ tions .
there is a increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ our patients who can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin in tum@@ our patients with the aim to transfer a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin below 13 g / dl because in few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time of approximately 4 hours at healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirror , which can be reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there are no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um mirror remains the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis ) is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ os@@ mos@@ us or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ y@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis was treated compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients that were not increased with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa , not increased ) .

if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break your therapy with ab@@ dic@@ amed and set it as your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection to a c@@ ene ( intraven@@ ous ) due to an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney illness .
a high hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin reduces the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in an increased or offensive cali@@ bre , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium values are back in the norm range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ unci@@ ation and so@@ unding cor@@ on@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease by in@@ sufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ idal mirror is not exceeds any given value .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic boun@@ cing as they fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a sickness that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hips may take a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflammation ) shortly after the application of as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can occur in the three days following in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta is attracted by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ ine and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently investigated a rolling fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was , whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that re@@ builds bone substance ) in the blood pressure or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ ine frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) has been reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) with those under placebo the risk of rolling frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or one of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion or oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die from bone tissue ) in jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physi@@ cians to prescri@@ be the medicine , as well as the drug may apply , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should consult the physician .

oste@@ opor@@ osis ( oste@@ opor@@ osis ) in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women - in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently in@@ experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in males become an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips . ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long R@@ low emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 m@@ g. daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently in@@ experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.@@ E. or@@ cial or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended before the first an@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
symptoms of symptoms resulting in the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cancer @-@ in@@ ine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because a limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and teen@@ agers A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age as data are missing for di@@ ality and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because for these patient population only limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is due to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient supplements of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of rapid en@@ rol@@ ment of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 m@@ g. daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with Kor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be induced before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates to a dental treatment with reasonable dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opathy in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment of the doctor &apos;s treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
symptoms of symptoms resulting in the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse adverse events were treated with patients that received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the overall frequency of pre@@ hop@@ el@@ ers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions that expressed itself as acceptance of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
alter@@ ation of the Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the ast@@ rolog@@ a- and placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory studies , the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were treated , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study , compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a rolling fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical trials , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ il@@ ingual field , especially with cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients or other dental attacks .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients stood in the jaw area during one with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved through gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) , the efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) has been shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al cells or a BM@@ D @-@ T Score for the cre@@ w@@ ess ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing sp@@ ine fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric sp@@ ine frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new cycl@@ ones ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients from 75 years and over had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one around 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased bone density on the lum@@ bar surface , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar region by 6.7 % , all the hips at 6.0 % , the weight of the wheel by about 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 82 ) were taken from the ili@@ ac cre@@ st after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized micro@@ computer analysis ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the carrying out of the supporting bone volume compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during courses .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured as routine , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to a 5.4 % increase in total assets and 4.3 % at the stake .
clinical effectiveness in men in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study were random@@ ized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures were 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study with males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the output value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confir@@ m@@ atically in patients ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase correspon@@ d@@ ingly to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ times of age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain aff@@ ecting were observed in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six @-@ month main study as Respon@@ der ( based on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic address of 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 71 who were treated with cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
unique and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes permanent in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ages independent .
then the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long continuous phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
surprise bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic dis@@ appearance of the large cycle with half @-@ time t ½ , 0.@@ 24 and t ½ h 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a season of elim@@ ination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and white , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearing of met@@ alized substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - because they are not a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function to a cre@@ at@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
for this population , there are no statements possible for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ tering intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) , given the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposition , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
Sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in 3 times daily ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which is approx . 6 times ) ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposition , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application with repeated application , the maximum of the intended Human exposition has been sufficient , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , and the liver , as well as intraven@@ ous injec@@ tions .
the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal of long bones in the growth phase with virtually all doses , a result that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance .
in rats we observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of serious ser@@ um calcium levels .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) has conducted the studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medication ) is not displayed . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ gel@@ s or insulin can be maintained except in patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ f@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ gel@@ s or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be recycled , and the blood sugar level drops better , thereby reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a donation of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value to conclude that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the trial therapy , the effect of the additional application of Ac@@ tos in the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide showed itself in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,@@ 94 % while the supple@@ mentary gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin had been investigated , the patients who participated in addition to insulin , received a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took a placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were optic nerve , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ lo@@ an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ations ) .
account may not be used in patients who may react adequ@@ ately ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ ones ) - ac@@ ac@@ ious ( in blood ) .
it has decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in general use ) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission announced the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited providing permission for the traffic of Ac@@ tos in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on a page the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ACT@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and oil to be observed when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular Out@@ come study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years , with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular disease has been performed .
in this study , a rise in reports about con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output Li@@ ver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease must not be used in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver canc@@ ers are as soon as possible again .
if a patient develops symptoms that lead to a ge@@ al dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper tree pain , ti@@ redness , appet@@ ite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver canc@@ ers .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on continued , should be directed by the laboratory parameters by clinical assessment .

move the skills at least 10 times between positions 1 and 2 and off , until the liquid is uni@@ form@@ ly white and dec@@ lining .
• To reduce the risk of un@@ condition@@ er wet pin , never put an inner sleeve on the injection side once you have lost it once .
279 G Keep the Flex@@ Pen with the injection needle on top and knock a few times with the finger gently against the cartridge to get existing air bubbles up in the cartridge .
the dose may be adjusted both up and down , by turning the dose button in the relevant direction until the correct dose is displayed compared to the marking of the display .
the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in the study , as the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) has carried out the studies in order to reach recommendations on the application of the drug .
the drug is an effective component of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , produced by the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 e @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document Author@@ ised for non commercial .
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
moreover , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to appro@@ ve the traffic of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id within the whole of the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast @-@ effective insulin needs to be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ effective insulin .
3 If the change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is necessary in the patient a dose adaptation can be necessary in the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor , since such travel may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken in other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration of funds during insulin therapy during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , biscuits , or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously through the doctor .
one clinical trial used in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ abe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic patients , which reduced overall surgical procedures ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , which reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire action duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ abe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assum@@ ption is close to that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and young people is similar to adults .

• Take off the closing stage . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical Tu@@ cker • Use the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Pull out the big outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
to avoid the injection of air and ensure the correct dosage : • Keep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle to the top • knock a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will continue to collect as above in the cartridge for a click on the arrows ( Figure B ) • While the injection leaves are still pointing upwards in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Put a drop down from the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin .
• Put the closing stage again so on the finished pen that the number 0 is faced with the dos@@ ing mark ( Figure D ) • check if the press stud is pressed completely .
if the pressure button can not move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection valve • The scale on the closing stage shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ po@@ ds , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or exposure marks ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ inary deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ure@@ ter is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg every day .
during the first treatment months , hist@@ ori@@ ans may still occur ; therefore , for the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic , more medicines are taken for the prevention of seal accidents .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had transplan@@ tation , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three multic@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( ph@@ ili@@ medication ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol applied in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose urine was carried out in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients , aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily amounted to 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients , which once daily exceeds 120 mg of an ur@@ inary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems , perhaps a increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood pressure of the urine , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in disease which have already led to urine texts ( including one of the history known or currently in the report no@@ des and / or a se@@ al@@ ment ) .
if the ser@@ um di@@ ac@@ id@@ spar after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and teen@@ agers had no experiences with children and young@@ sters , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transplan@@ t when there is no experience in transplan@@ tation , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases In patients with isch@@ a@@ ic heart disease or de@@ comp@@ iling heart failure , treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic medicines , it may occur during the treatment of a acute attack , due to the lower@@ ing of the Serbian di@@ ac@@ id@@ ac@@ id@@ ings initially in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , reading ( Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases indicates that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the clinical studies of Phase 3 , slight ab@@ normal@@ ities of the liver function was observed with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out liver function prior to the start of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ al treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was no inter@@ dependent studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ stands ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors are not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without making a dose adaptation for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study involving subjects carried 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , resulting in a possible weak visual effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , which is delayed by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and caused a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies can not be made to adverse events of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies will not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be c@@ auti@@ ous in the tax of a vehicle , processing machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities , until they can be reason@@ ably safe , that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be dis@@ advant@@ ageous .
a total higher incidence of the Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patients years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patients years ) were observed , although no statist@@ ically significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relation to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors caused by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency or a de@@ com@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once reported are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who at the same time be treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , no severe skin attacks or severe hyper@@ sensitivity can be observed .
7 Open long @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 906 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those related to Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following results @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once , and joined patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an extern@@ alization of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and gyp@@ sum .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly recur@@ ring brick was &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 0.3 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ kre@@ in@@ ine value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of 6 mg / dl ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lower@@ ing of the ser@@ um@@ bel@@ ac@@ id@@ spar at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently on the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ ized &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al functional limitations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was reached the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical differences in the percentage of the percentage of the ser@@ um @-@ acid con@@ cent@@ ur@@ ities at subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy ren@@ al dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ konzentr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um of ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years in the phase 3 showed that the lasting reduction of the index was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) in the months of 16 @-@ 24 patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a shift of exposure ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the exposure size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the k@@ k@@ no@@ des until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma @-@ centric units ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma @-@ scale curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after sub@@ mitt@@ ing simpler and multi @-@ stroke doses of 10 mg to 120 mg of dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for cans of 120 mg and 300 mg , a increase of AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ ing propor@@ tioned increase .
following the intake of simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 μ@@ g / ml .
however no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ di@@ konzentr@@ ation , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent state @-@ to @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 liters , depending on doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width that reaches cans of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 were formed , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide primarily showed through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marking , Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at were about 49 % of the dose in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ abolic ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , about 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ abolic ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mid @-@ total AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ times per h / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe ren@@ al function .

age There were no significant changes in relation to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of the fertility of male rats was found statist@@ ically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder ( trans@@ itional @-@ pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) in relation to X@@ an@@ thin @-@ treated group , with about 11 @-@ fold exposure of exposure in humans .
these findings are considered as a result of a specialist Pur@@ in@@ met@@ at@@ isation and urine composition and for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproduction of male and female rats .
in high doses , about 4.1 of the human therapeutic exposure , the maternal tox@@ icity occurred , which went in with a decrease in charge capacity and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies of carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times of the human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ünst@@ ig ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take care of the day &apos;s first food intake , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , which date from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to comply with the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to increase the increase in vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who made solely Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data before that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ade ( ul@@ cer@@ al pain ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ al pain ) , digest@@ ion ( bl@@ oss@@ oms ) , dri@@ v@@ ous abdom@@ en ( bl@@ unt stomach ) as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be applied .
it may not be used for diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only used with mineral water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day .
the following critics are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of hyper@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al friction and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be lu@@ red after applying the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patient should not take a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before intake of the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing so@@ da burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that hin@@ ge on a py@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing transfers to the patient will be shared and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was observed , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ ical and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and associated with complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported mainly intraven@@ ously at cancer patients whose therapeutic eg@@ om@@ ime contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the transfer of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a kie@@ fer@@ ous surgical procedure which reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the doctor &apos;s treat@@ able doctor is crucial for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the dose of the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the next morning after being noticed .
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ os@@ mos@@ us ) , should also be treated adequ@@ ately at the start of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly associated drug agents , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no clu@@ ster@@ ing effects regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most of the reports date from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um of ser@@ um calcium carbonate of up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurs in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .

in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more cycl@@ ones .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D from sp@@ inal column and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continue to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ eb@@ onal controlled studies in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and subsequently taken 10 mg daily either via 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new cycl@@ one by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ fts on a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the middle oral bi@@ over@@ feeding of women between 5 and 70 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0,@@ 39 % , when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at had taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) was not clin@@ ically significant change of oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is divided into soft tissue after intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly divi@@ des in bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered by adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a dis@@ gust@@ ing of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator of efficacy was the number of patients , in which transplan@@ t was cancelled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often a renewed organ@@ transplan@@ t or re@@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , more studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investigated as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body .

patients and doctors have to be c@@ auti@@ ous when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs can be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the same drug may need to be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ arded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts should be attributed to this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in System@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ og@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulation of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ tation . ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative wording , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ing adjustments must be performed to ensure systematic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sive and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) Recommend@@ ations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirror should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , comparable with both wording or in le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ treatment phase .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , it can take an adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of patients in the first post @-@ operative phase no oral medication is allowed , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus treat can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml ) to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression has to be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy is not specified .
dos@@ ing advice - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other means of dos@@ ing can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be changed during the stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dos@@ ing recommendation - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dos@@ ing recommended dose - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf have a gra@@ ft of daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . thus , this change@@ over in relation to a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ inas every day has to begin treatment with recommended oral and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ ation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
transplan@@ tation in adult patients who are at Ad@@ vag@@ inas is to take an oral initi@@ ation of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day .
other transplan@@ t care recipient though there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ al transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with bo@@ wel transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ing in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dos@@ ing adap@@ tion is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of the ser@@ um @-@ in@@ ine mirror , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley levels in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sive and toler@@ ability in individual cases under aid of full blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley levels of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f at Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous application of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf a drug with a low clearing is , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the valley levels of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in n@@ ursing and heart@@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease , usually blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used .
this has led to severe adverse events , including transplan@@ tation or other side effects , which can occur in sequence of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ flow .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulation of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ tation . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be treated against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va as therapy @-@ resistant , are still no clinical data for the ret@@ inal form@@ ulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
to order proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ tation claims in childhood are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
due to possible interaction , which can lead to a reduction of the clinical effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , the consumption of herbal supplements , which may contain cur@@ rant wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant healing during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood , as the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , the chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy occ@@ ured in rare cases , thus can be observed under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ i@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid loading , and oil .
like in other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of sun protection using a high protection factor .
if patients , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus are taking symptoms for Pre@@ s like head@@ aches , alter@@ ing consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual problems , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hard capsules , ret@@ arded , l@@ act@@ ose included , is advis@@ able in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary p@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can affect or lower the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , and thus lower the blood values of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels in the same gift of substances which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain equivalent concentration levels ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a heavily balanced interaction was made with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly caused by the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trans@@ forming .
high @-@ do@@ si@@ re pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute ab@@ ul@@ sive reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of acro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can affect their metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ m lower the clearing of ster@@ oid contra@@ ven@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormone base , with decisions about sensitive action is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of exam@@ inations in transplan@@ ts provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ li@@ m an increased risk of adverse events regarding the course and result of pregnancy is made .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a new@@ born monitoring is advis@@ able for any adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding his effect on the kidneys ) .
it is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ bor@@ ro@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :

cases of BC@@ s @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ lic acid therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ inas .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lympho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ m@@ able .
active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed to a cy@@ tos@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in cell@@ ul@@ ers .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duc@@ ing due to the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lympho@@ cytes genes .
T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus supports the activation of T cells and prolifer@@ ation of cells @-@ cells dependent prolifer@@ ation of cells ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g -@@ inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recept@@ ors .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ dig@@ f in these published studies have been applied for observ@@ ations in the big studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f has been used for liver , kidney or heart transplan@@ tation .
L@@ ung@@ ing transplan@@ tation in an intermediate analysis about a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ dig@@ f was reported over 110 patients that received either T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
chronic transplan@@ tation , which was obl@@ iter@@ ative , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis , bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the emergence of a bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated compared to 3@@ 8.0 % of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) , was significantly larger ( n = 0.0@@ 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was not any acute tran@@ scription , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3,3 % ) and after 1 year ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ ch@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ al transplan@@ tation was performed on 205 patients with oral surgery , which resulted in a placebo and kidney transplan@@ tation , which received a random@@ ised method T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
oral initi@@ ation ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus amounted to 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the targeted valley levels of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study associated with oral transplan@@ tation in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ ero@@ oms and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids are supposed to be responsible for the higher clearing @-@ rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place over the G@@ alle .
for stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ance is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one caused by lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application will be addressed after@@ ward if Adv@@ ancement is used for the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell where a gene has been inserted into which a gene ( DNA ) was enabled to become the formation of the human sense factor VIII .
Adv@@ ancement has been licensed to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is differently produced so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ ag@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by the prevention of blood vessels as well as surgical intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in 86 % of 510 was evaluated with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies towards factor VIII .
Adv@@ ance should not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human scent factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission adopted B@@ ax@@ ter AG permit for the marketing of adv@@ ances in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of subst@@ itution therapy is based upon the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gel , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or i.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger of the patient is over .
during treatment it is used to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a reasonable determination of the VIII plasma plasma deficiency .
individual patients can differ in reaction to factor VIII , to achieve various in vivo Recovery and different half @-@ time periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis to long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given cans between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities does not be reached , or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to follow an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII &apos;s therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration speed should be set according to the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied at Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using a modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 exposure stage at the biggest is and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure passages and an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic inhibit@@ or of inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lowest tit@@ ular ) inhibit@@ ors is observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s showed inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which occur in previously untreated patients that have increased risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII ( 10 @-@ 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) occurs in one patient under contin@@ ual A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained throughout the period and both factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in the plasma and clearing @-@ rate showed sufficient values on the 15 . postoperative day .
in case of clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic heavier H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure passages with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in any of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was diagnosed with an age of less than 6 years ( ≥ 50 % ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms appear on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product positions within the study .
7 . as in other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on hyper@@ sensitivity to allergic reactions , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in treated patients with severe or moderate he@@ ed@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the first authorisation available , CH@@ MP has continued to consider the benefit risk factor being positively evaluated , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of safety filter by A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s all 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited submitted to the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , the company officially rec@@ eded its application for authorisation of an advoc@@ ating of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and rests ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been so altered that there is no copies of itself , and thus cannot solve infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the non def@@ icient in the human body &apos;s p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company put data from a study with a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ tree , in bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the answer , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the test of initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has provided a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will bring benefits to the patient .
the Committee also had concerns about the treatment of drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in a reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of patients for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed mode of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so comp@@ elled that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hypo@@ cris@@ p , induced inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al skin sw@@ ell@@ ation ( clo@@ cking nose ) .
in adults and teen@@ agers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ g nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be ref@@ using on the nose .
the main efficiency measures were the sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cr@@ e symptoms that were reported in the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
with regard of all the hypo@@ cr@@ e symptoms except for the c@@ aching of the nose reported the patients that Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income reported about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who pose P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7,4 % vs 26,@@ 7 % in the patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( throat level ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , mental pain , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , or one of the other components , against rep@@ in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ge agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine to treat aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glau@@ coma ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by bra@@ in@@ ous bleeding ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced its approval by SP Europe to appro@@ ve the traffic of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , if necessary to swal@@ low ( i.e. without bit@@ ing or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied for children under 12 years due to the lack of data regarding the lack of data and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take off time .
after decre@@ asing the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine also is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .

safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ collective , and the data will not submit to appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data do not submit to corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
the patients need to be informed about the treatment of occurrence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a speed@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be cancelled .
in the treatment of the following patient groups to be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digit@@ alis • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise able to prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce in their extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 did not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ tru@@ th@@ fulness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied above that it may occur in very rare cases , which may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( seals , Ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished intellectual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular de@@ aps ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ at@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the release of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion connector P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance , including rein@@ forcement subjective impacts or duties which are linked to flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal aller@@ gies , whereby 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets received .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determines from the overall co@@ res for symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ skin sw@@ ell@@ ation ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine across the 2 week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in relation to the swelling effect , determines from the nas@@ al s@@ inal swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ fertility , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demon@@ stra@@ ble within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers on 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached on Day 10 .
in the context of an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was conducted with form@@ ulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was noted that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was badly damaged .
a component intervention study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to the general gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the exposition to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for tox@@ ic@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not recognise any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ productive @-@ fiction studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was not weighed in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by the alter@@ ation of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the melting tablet in the same way is dev@@ alu@@ able as the tablets and use in children are harmless .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg ac@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo .
in both studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ erial us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 % and 33 % compared to placebo patients treated .
ast@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other ingredients .

there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in during teen@@ agers from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the symptoms of previous disease and may be resumed after the end of the symptoms and will be resumed .
in the persistent allergy @-@ allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended for continuous treatment throughout the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were observed in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol and alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials of various indications including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic urine , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with ast@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common side effects , which was reported more frequently than in placebo , fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) were reported .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ es@@ cent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect of the head@@ ache was treated with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ete@@ en clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion body P @-@ sel@@ tin to end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple sclerosis in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , a dose of up to 20 mg daily was administered over 14 days a day , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ ascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals showed itself .
for a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including rein@@ forcement subjective impacts or duties which are linked to flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , ag@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ b , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ash , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as on the basis of the whole quest@@ ionnaire based on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
chronic idiopath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was evi@@ den@@ ounced for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , in different forms , is similar to the different forms and can be recru@@ ited by chronic patients .
since the hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also carried out in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guides .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic urine was A@@ erial us effective in enh@@ ancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idiopath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study .
improvement of the increase in volume of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with an@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleeping and growth significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients Dem@@ ograph@@ ies were comparable to the general seasonal Rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients received a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits non @-@ vivo CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ cope study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre @-@ clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not recognise any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ erial us can be taken independently of meals , for alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis is caused by infection for children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is present , which support treatment of inf@@ ectious rhin@@ itis with an@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies , should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher sub@@ strate ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to children that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol . therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se in@@ suffici@@ ency does not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were observed in clinical trials with an@@ eri@@ us tablets at which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol and alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall th@@ reading of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idiopath@@ ic urine , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with ast@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ete@@ en clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , which came to a question of anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , obtained a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ os@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idiopath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , a dose of up to 20 mg has been applied daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ov@@ ascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals showed itself .

as shown on the basis of the whole quest@@ ionnaire of quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ erial us tablets were effectively induced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopath@@ ic urine was A@@ erial us effective in enh@@ ancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with si@@ up@@ form@@ ulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 to 6 hours higher and the c@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies show that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to the recommended doses , with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely .

June 2008 Nov@@ artis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. were officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , caused by the strain of the influ@@ enza A virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to safegu@@ ard a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus arises , that can easily spread from man to person because humans have not constructed imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; bodi@@ ly &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this Stam@@ ina faster anti@@ bodies .
then the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m surface , which det@@ ects the human body as bodi@@ ly ) , cleaned and used as a part of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this resulted in the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical test and need further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor .
if you wish further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs to treat adults and children over four years using the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ re@@ ase is available as a solution for rede@@ em@@ ing , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ re@@ ase should then be classified if the doctor has examined who has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has evaluated the virus to address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of chor@@ age is based on the body weight .
A@@ bo@@ ase decre@@ ases the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to heal , however , the damage of the immune system and thereby also hes@@ it@@ ating the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ bo@@ ase has been compared with 206 adults who had previously used Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with not demon@@ stra@@ ble concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the study involving patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo , but car@@ re@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ bo@@ ve also decreased the viral load , however , from the children that had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease of use only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who used to be treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ bo@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continue their existing prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ bo@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , a flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( ti@@ redness ) .
2 / 3 A@@ re@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant wort ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines that are just as at@@ ed@@ ase and harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as in other medicines for HIV , HIV is taking care of patients who are taking care of a li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( symptoms of infection ) or an immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bo@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risk .
A@@ bo@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee set out that the use of A@@ bo@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not detected .
A@@ bo@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; outstanding circumstances &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the traffic of A@@ bo@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ bo@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) of treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ sper@@ ase is supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is reduced by 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ bo@@ ase has been used without the enh@@ ancing additi@@ ve of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied at A@@ bo@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily most maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ at@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ bo@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ re@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data relating to imp@@ unity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg capsules with severe liver function to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function in 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or regular liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ re@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also indicate sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the cur@@ rant wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk reduction of reduced plasma cent@@ ur@@ ines and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ re@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to cure HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ bo@@ ase is supposed to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepat@@ itis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous tivir@@ al treatment of hepat@@ itis B or C please read the related information on this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepat@@ itis are showing an increased frequency of liver function in anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ bo@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ o@@ ids , which can be induced via CY@@ P3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ ost@@ ero@@ id effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and re@@ pression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the refin@@ ing of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on the i@@ Gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the active concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ bo@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with ampl@@ is@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ atory symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity caused by the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of tox@@ icity , this loan form has been contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with care of certain patient groups .
A@@ re@@ ase should be placed in duration 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses , their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eases , are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) , a anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can evol@@ ve to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ re@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also indicate sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ bo@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with drugs , whose mechanisms are mainly controlled via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ad@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to increase the harvest@@ ed plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , have been observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be performed by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already St. John &apos;s wort , the ampl@@ av@@ ir@@ mirror is and if possible to check the viral load and add the cur@@ sor &apos;s wort .
a dos@@ ing adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary if c@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ o@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ cos@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase for temperatures by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and thou@@ ght@@ fulness of this treatment schem@@ as .
52 % dri@@ fting if am@@ per@@ ca@@ is ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg cho@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which have been reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ar@@ ra@@ viol@@ r twice daily ) , are approx . 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is not a close monitoring as the efficacy and non@@ sense of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ bo@@ ase are at least one hour ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with ampl@@ is@@ ency in combination with ampl@@ is@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dos@@ ing adjustment is required .
the treatment with em@@ ir@@ ency in combination with ampl@@ is@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ ta is not recommended as the exposure of both pros@@ thes@@ es would be de@@ ath@@ ed .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine might be sun@@ k into the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able as Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this medicine should be used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is supposed to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % , thus increasing side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ bo@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with car@@ bi@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma level of both medicines could be increased by both drugs .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma once daily , which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without any simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that can be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or , or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can result in common to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with aspir@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ bo@@ ve , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ o@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of plasma cutting of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium block@@ ages such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ di@@ pin , ti@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ bo@@ ase can increase the plasma centr@@ ations and ampli@@ fy the side effects , including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ics , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous ca@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ bo@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these Glu@@ k@@ o@@ co@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment exceeds the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical cor@@ relation ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin which depends heavily from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , are more pronounced increases of plasma cutting at the same administration of a@@ Gener@@ ase .
because plasma increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or for My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ omet@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
there is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended for stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma cent@@ ur@@ ic of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ li@@ m can be increased in the same gift of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , car@@ eg@@ ase should not be applied along with or@@ ally attached mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the same application of as@@ on@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ atory symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the small compar@@ ability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the same time , as the ampl@@ is@@ ite is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation together with A@@ re@@ ase , a stronger control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ ven@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the same gift of A@@ bo@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks of the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were found , however , it is not known whether am@@ per@@ ca@@ vi@@ r passes into the breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ otic power in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during post@@ age .
the further development of earnings including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproduction was not affected by the administration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ ly .
in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side @-@ related side effects of side effects were light up to moder@@ ately marked , rates up early and rarely were led to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are involved in relation to the in@@ gest@@ ion or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients were not treated twice daily with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) reported by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients showed , and also under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy is associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of o@@ idal and fa@@ ec@@ al fat tissues , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat collection ( Sti@@ cker ) .
in the 113 , anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in has been treated for a medium duration of 36 weeks ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients ( 3 % ) in less than 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is about a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
skin precip@@ itation were usually mild to moder@@ ately balanced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without having the treatment with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ k had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ar@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy ( ART ) , a anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ viral reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients , which were 600 mg of car@@ bi@@ ase twice daily with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were associated with rheumato@@ id ceri@@ de and C@@ p@@ k values , which were associated with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which were very common .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are included .
ampl@@ is@@ r binds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the proc@@ urement of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ ari@@ zation steps with the result of a formation un@@ ripe , not inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lympho@@ cytes .

the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to keep up the current inter@@ pret@@ ational systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests .
based on phenom@@ enal resistance testing laboratory testing systems Klin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the assessment of activity of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to ampl@@ is@@ r associated genetic samples produces a certain cross @-@ resist@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ ta .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resist@@ ence between am@@ at@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance class , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ anti @-@ viral infections ( one of them reported a resistance to at@@ is@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ ta / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a different therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that can affect the following treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ bo@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) , with an PI , predominantly with low @-@ rate Knight @-@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; received . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one hund@@ red@@ th three and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with im@@ bal@@ ances of viral sensitivity , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the default value of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ gen@@ otype of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the efficacy of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ bo@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 had been treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ bo@@ ase has been tested for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who administered N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these data should be considered in the therapeutic optim@@ isation of the benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; aspir@@ in . &quot;
according to oral administration , the maximum length ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r with a meal lead to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) has remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous nutritional intake imp@@ lies the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of active concentration in the plasma , although the amount of un@@ bound am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls occur in dependence on the total concentration of the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that CY@@ P3@@ A4 must in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be given to caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ bo@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ at@@ avi@@ al @-@ exposure to adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ op@@ o@@ able as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ re@@ ase solution and car@@ ve capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low @-@ elim@@ ination of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r plasma screens similar to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r twice a day without any administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity for mice and rats occurred in male animals , aden@@ oma in doses of dos@@ ages , which were two times daily ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the army @-@ cell aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet cleared , and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for the human being is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , a little evidence of the assum@@ ption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ius tests , the bacterial reverse test tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ nuclear test of human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes was contained in human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes , was am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity may be monitored and proven in clinical everyday by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during administration of A@@ Gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals that were treated from a age of 4 days , both in the control as well as with the am@@ at@@ avi@@ al animals treated a high mortality .
in case of system@@ ic plasma samples which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ bo@@ ase has been used without the enh@@ ancing additi@@ ve of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied at A@@ bo@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily most maximum dose of 2400 mg am@@ at@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is supposed to be performed in patients with weak or mild liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the active concentration .
A@@ re@@ ase should be placed in duration 27 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ad@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increase for temperatures by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which have been reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ar@@ ra@@ viol@@ r twice daily ) , are approx . 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is not a close monitoring as the efficacy and non@@ sense of this combination is not known .
the treatment with em@@ ir@@ ency in combination with ampl@@ is@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ ta is not recommended as the exposure of both pros@@ thes@@ es would be de@@ ath@@ ed .
if this medicine should be used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is supposed to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ bo@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium block@@ ages such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ di@@ pin , ti@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ per@@ vas@@ cul@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous ca@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation together with A@@ re@@ ase , a stronger control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r by 22 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful removal of the possible commercial use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by ev@@ o@@ cer@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during a halt .
in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are included .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lympho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r is found in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the therapeutic optim@@ isation of &quot; un@@ bund@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ bo@@ ase is considered to be considered in the therapeutic optim@@ isation of PI .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing inter@@ v@@ alls occur in dependence on the total concentration of the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that CY@@ P3@@ A4 must in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ate or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be given to caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al disorder occurs on the elim@@ ination of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity for mice and rats occurred in male animals , aden@@ oma during dos@@ ages , which were random@@ ised to 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the o@@ cel@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet cleared , and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for the human being is un@@ clear .
however , there is little evidence of the assum@@ ption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ius tests , the bacterial reverse test tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ nuclear test of human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes was contained in human peripher@@ al lympho@@ cytes , was am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals that were treated from a age of 4 days , both in the control as well as with the am@@ at@@ avi@@ al animals treated a high mortality .
these results indicate that in young , the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not fully equipped , so that am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of form@@ ulation ( z ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) , treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefits offered with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; has not been treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is reduced by 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules using the intake of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ bo@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg am@@ o@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dos@@ ing recommended dose may be given for simultaneous use of A@@ generator &apos;s solution to rede@@ em and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adaptation is not necessary for am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , a application of as@@ on@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reactions as a result of the high prop@@ yl gly@@ col , A@@ bo@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated by pregnant women and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competent in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this medicine , possibly causing serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects such as heart rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ re@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to cure HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines to cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determin@@ ing the active concentration .
A@@ re@@ ase should be placed in duration if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces .
H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eases , are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sen .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ad@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increase for temperatures by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ mat@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ bo@@ ase can increase the plasma centr@@ ations and increase the side effects , including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ics , optic nerve and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s oral administration is significantly higher than Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk of human being is not known as A@@ bo@@ ase solution for inclusion must not be applied during pregnancy because of potential toxic reactions of the fet@@ us in the pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

it can harm other people , even if they have the same problems as you have . − If any of the observed side effects you have considerably imp@@ aired or you have noticed side effects which are not specified in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally indicate A@@ bo@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect of A@@ bo@@ ase .
the use of A@@ bo@@ ase is based on your doctor &apos;s individual viral resistance test and your treatment story .
inform your doctor if you suffer from one of the above diseases or take any of the medicine above .
if your doctor is recommended that you take A@@ bo@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( booster ) , make sure you have read the manual information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before the start of treatment .
similarly , there are no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ bo@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to treat children under the age of 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For taking A@@ bo@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before taking A@@ Gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the cream is thin before bed@@ time to apply to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficient ( about eight hours ) on the skin , before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also investigated in two studies with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies , where patients were treated six weeks and were treated either daily or five times a week .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in all four major studies , 15 % to 52 % were treated with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % were treated with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or a sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , treatment time can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed according to the re@@ generation of skin treated approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
there are no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment should be moved with super@@ fi@@ ant bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in other suitable therapy forms .

these clinical signs submitted by clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies involving I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / sc@@ andal ( 14 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs is shown that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very common to severe er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe damage ( 19 % ) came .
in clinical trials involved in the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental one @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ algia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , an increasing system@@ ic concentration of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured up its effectiveness ( in relation to reducing G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not used .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission announced the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the traffic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also continue to be monitored continuously , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made available only in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ vit@@ alizing equipment for medical emergen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibody against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when used by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break is due , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment has to be c@@ auti@@ ous .

in case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on the half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion has to be stopped , until the symptoms are reduced to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is possible .
in@@ fusion can be resumed with the reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
experimental studies will not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended to satisfy , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were classified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
undes@@ i@@ rable drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older , are listed in the following table after the following common frequencies : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in preliminary history , bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial ton@@ ality ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 trial with 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly heavy tra@@ pped form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with a heavy @-@ run shape mostly within one month to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 trial ( respectively up to an early retirement of the study ) amounted to 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demon@@ stra@@ ble anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients who never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low anti@@ bodies for a solid decrease in the urine , while in patients with high anti@@ bodies , a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was found .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ gin@@ ally to the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ ired drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies .
the reas@@ oning for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the reduction of an accumulation is sufficient to restore the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the cycle and absorbed by cells to the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients received from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ged exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is an improvement of lung function and the in@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant , and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
of 26 patients with an hepat@@ ocy@@ st treatment ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the resin ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant for the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients that sum@@ s up by using a combined end score , the clin@@ ically significant changes were summar@@ ised for five effectiveness ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted primarily to investig@@ ate security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients ( 16 patients with heavy digest@@ ive form and 4 with the mean ver@@ aging form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased risk of G@@ AG@@ - Mir@@ rors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean depression form a normal mental development process , whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume , and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity at repeated gift and reproduction , the pre @-@ clinical data can not recognise any particular dangers for humans .

Ali@@ m@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( one other drug against cancer ) in patients who still have not removed chemotherapy ( drugs alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant treatment alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant or metastatic ) is probably easily spread to other parts of the body . • more advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ us cells .
Ali@@ m@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chemotherapy as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during treatment with ali@@ m@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if ali@@ m@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition to or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally to prevent &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose bleeding occurs , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed down , ab@@ rupt or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
Ali@@ m@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of Ali@@ m@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
Ali@@ m@@ ta has also compared gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with Ali@@ m@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the all@@ ying sub@@ mitt@@ ing of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with Ali@@ m@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el compared with 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , patients were unable to attack the cell squ@@ am@@ bles , with the administration of Ali@@ m@@ ta for longer periods of survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to promote the traffic of Ali@@ m@@ ta in the whole of the European Union .
each container has to be solved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is collected and diluted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion in the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ single bron@@ ch@@ oral cancer , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ pus ero@@ id .
during the seven days prior to the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as after each third closing cycle .
patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before every gift a complete blood pattern was created , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te and a plat@@ el@@ bow .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dos@@ ing test must take place under correction of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre @-@ going therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood pressure .
should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be broken with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient underwent value prior to treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ - a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increased side risk factor exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for infin@@ ity and efficacy .
in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dos@@ ing adap@@ tions were necessary , which go beyond the dose of recommended Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations .
the data situation in patients with a cancer @-@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; to the 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to 3.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of metast@@ asis ) are not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients need to be monitored in relation to the bone and supp@@ ression , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ aco@@ at reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ bow was reached again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al numbers , plat@@ el@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 of ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ at@@ ted when a pre @-@ treatment was taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore all patients need to be used to use p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ation ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection , a drainage of result in front of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally , if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated lives ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn should be pointed out to bring consultation on the lock services .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid ant@@ yl acid ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the result of an increased birth of side effects .
therefore caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ ing , 2 days after the therapy with pas@@ sports ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ IDs as long as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be prevented for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the state status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during a use during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary - and after careful considering of the use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability is caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ ity barrier .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to the breast milk and unwanted effects of the stri@@ ped inf@@ ant can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity undes@@ i@@ rable effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Er@@ - were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients enrolled in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om has been shown in the use of the lung cancer patients in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) against the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are characterized by an improvement of lung working parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the control over time .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ ching food .
patients who use all@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
these enzymes are in@@ hibited by these enzymes , they can avoid some fats in food , thereby making a quarter of the fats caused by the intest@@ ine .
in a third study 3@@ 91 all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg total weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for the patient .

it may not be used in patients suffering from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent transplan@@ ting patients ) or with medicines such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to Chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and for pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission submitted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for authorisation of the European Union for use by Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body mass index BMI , 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fet@@ ching diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and young people under 18 , because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absor@@ bs , elderly and kidney function is not necessary for dosage with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich meal or fet@@ al diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can go with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who need to consult a medicine or pharmac@@ ist before the start of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
patients who use all@@ i and medicines for hypertension or an elevated Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine must be adjusted .
it is recommended to make additional fluctu@@ ations prevention , in order to prevent any of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with the same application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma screens .
in use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ atory anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alized rati@@ os , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ics remained in the norm range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin to ensure adequate vit@@ amine ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers from the same time , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of imprisoned fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known adverse events that were noted after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known because these events were volunte@@ ered by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi@@ ples of up to 400 mg three times daily were given to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose may be reported either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research and animal , from a rapid recovery of any system@@ ic effects , which can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ent properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect places in the l@@ umen of mag@@ ens and the upper thin intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , absorption of about 25 % of food fatty acids .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BMI of 60 mg / m2 cover the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ic , o@@ ily nour@@ ishing nutrition .
the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial level ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight ( Table 1 ) and as part of the body weight of subjects that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their original weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss in the first 6 months was observed .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( nominal value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( nominal value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy ; the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( such as c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there are not enough information regarding the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance effect the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the bo@@ wel .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adult , chem@@ otherap@@ ies received a strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ xi had no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
for chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission announces the business of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the resort of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting near severe chemotherapy after cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on stage , patients should be super@@ vised with am@@ nesty and signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able at the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is pro@@ lon@@ gs or which tend to such an extension .
in connection with an additional chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift Alo@@ xi is in@@ treated in the days of chemotherapy neither for the prevention nor treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not in@@ hibit the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady static concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ idal concentration of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or showed .
in one population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ induc@@ tors , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , c@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , ic@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , quin@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies do not lie , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is considered necessary by the doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe ann@@ ot@@ al effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least al@@ armed with al@@ xi patient in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and fruit ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions in the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing expertise .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies were similar to adverse events such as in the other doses ; no dose @-@ action relationships were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy at an al@@ xi@@ ation over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind@@ studies , 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously given to Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ itted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients that were given at day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies of chemotherapy induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the relevant effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma centr@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average stop time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in the entire dos@@ ing range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in the patient and cancer @-@ patient dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma cutting at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the total sum of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time release of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % of the kidneys have been eliminated and roughly another 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ abolic zones , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a less@@ er degree , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ions , which can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose regim@@ en said in about 30 times of the therapeutic exposition in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , ou@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known but due to the high doses of dos@@ ages and as Alo@@ xi is determined when people used to use it , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the exploration of hepat@@ itis C treatment intended for the treatment of hepat@@ itis C 6 million IE / ml injec@@ tor solution was approved .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practic@@ able ingredient , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long tender ) Hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination the liver tissue has damage , moreover , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ ity of Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , which stimulates the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on related data that demonstrate the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and effectiveness in hepat@@ itis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepat@@ itis C the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on has been compared with the efficacy of the reference guide to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition there were concerns relating to the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of patients with hepat@@ itis C associated with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease re@@ kind@@ led to more patients than on the reference medicine ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
in addition , the test was used in the study to investig@@ ate the question of how the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cru@@ sten@@ osis ) and small in@@ sof@@ ten@@ ing in@@ filtr@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , di@@ ced and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resist@@ ente Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not affect this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the surface area should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment two to three days , the doctor should investig@@ ate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial cells ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and reduces the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was reduced by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients enrolled in placebo spoke on the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin problems , about 90 % of both groups were treated to treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that al@@ ar@@ go was caused by treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( wh@@ ole@@ ums in body tissue ) or infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go over the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , di@@ ced or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the traffic of Al@@ tar@@ go into the whole European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days are to be considered once and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensiti@@ zation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treatment of infections where MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen or susp@@ ects ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered when 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low level of plasma centr@@ ations , which were achieved by people after top@@ ical application to loose skin or infected deep wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 By simultaneous gift of 2 times per day , 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean sa@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ ing adap@@ ts are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction according to oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement on the birth and the federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin salad should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or termin@@ ated the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary between the benefit of a halt for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go was used , was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation by the meeting , which considered approximately 1 % of patients .

the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a particular bonds of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the binding alternative of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts of anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding office of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om P binding office and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
by binding on this binding agent P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mut@@ il@@ ine blocked the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ate , partially block @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some infection forms should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to treatment S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment daily at oc@@ clu@@ sion on in@@ tak@@ e@@ ated and on suspended skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary and trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the human after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ ine on 200 c@@ m2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP inhibit@@ or .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepat@@ itis A and hepat@@ itis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within a two doses of existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hepat@@ itis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ ization has a low risk of hepat@@ itis B infection and ensured that it can be led to an end using two doses .
if a release dose against hepat@@ itis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix can be given to the Ambi@@ ent or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines act as they contributed to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix also includes the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ v &apos; vaccine since 1996 and has been a Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ vis@@ as and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are containing identical ingredients , some of the data which supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ vis@@ ors , also used as proof of the Ambi@@ rix application .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration camp one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix carried out a month after the last injection of hepat@@ itis A and B for the last injection of the last injection of hepat@@ itis A and B .
the additional study showed that the ambient temperature was similar to the Ambi@@ rix for a six @-@ month gap between injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react to patients that are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) to active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) should not be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the entertainment of the Ambi@@ ent company in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for basic gr@@ ati@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a release is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepat@@ itis @-@ bean surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bodies observed in the same mag@@ n@@ itude according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully secured whether imm@@ ac@@ ent people who have addressed hepat@@ itis @-@ A@@ - vacc@@ ination is required , because they may also be protected by immune memory by no more det@@ ectable anti@@ bodies .
3 . as with all injec@@ tion@@ si@@ fs , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction according to the gift of vacc@@ ines , medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepat@@ itis B is required , the standardi@@ zation is recommended with the combination of hepat@@ itis B , the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies , so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines can be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal imp@@ ending success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ut@@ ational disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected , however , as it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ cul@@ - m@@ um@@ ps tube , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ og@@ u@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency has to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ o@@ rec@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the installation of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the ambi@@ ance of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combination .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given the Ambi@@ rix had pain , over 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combine vacc@@ ination .
however , the frequency of mat@@ h was comparable ( i.e. via the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses of combination ) .
the frequency of pre@@ g@@ nat@@ ing pain and perme@@ ability was low and comparable , which was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local re@@ actions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was similar to which the hepat@@ itis B @-@ B combined with 360 EL@@ ISA units was observed with a combined hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per tape , reports .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 doses of vacc@@ as with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ doses of hepat@@ itis C and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials that were performed in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ struction rates of anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ struction rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined fuel with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose imm@@ unity was worth@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ting rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher against hepat@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 dos@@ ing material significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
at the time of pri@@ or@@ ti@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which was formed according to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen in a dos@@ ing volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in 0 @-@ 6 months .
if the first dose ambient in the second year is simultaneously combined with a combined slide , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study that was carried out with 3 doses of current wording in adults showed similar PCR form@@ ulation and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ bills for previous form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is available both before and after resp@@ us@@ pen@@ al notice on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepat@@ itis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing water contam@@ inated water .
you may feel very tired , a dark urine , a blow face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not complete completely prior to infection with Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series is complete with 2 doses .
if you are infected with hepat@@ itis C or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ inations or hepat@@ itis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent any vacc@@ ination .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those for hepat@@ itis C or Hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If with you / your child already an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) has shown .
an allergic reaction can be used by it@@ chy skin precip@@ itation , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepat@@ itis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepat@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually the second vacc@@ inations ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepat@@ itis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a dimin@@ ished content of effective hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vaccine series at the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes the Ambi@@ ent is inj@@ ected with people who are suffering from serious blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own physical defence / or if you / your child is subject to a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination can not be enough , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction on vacc@@ ination is .
21 . tell your doctor if you / her child may take another medicine / rede@@ em ( including those who have received no sp@@ elling ) or if you have received / her child recently / has been given / or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it can be that in this case , immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepat@@ itis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if another vaccine is to be given with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ ent is not administered to pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women , except for Hepatitis A , hepat@@ itis B can be vacc@@ inated .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) once you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , please contact your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 doses ) : • p@@ ains or complaints at the rec@@ tification or redness • Mat@@ ern@@ ability • head@@ ache • appet@@ ite

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of data , which have been announced since the issu@@ ance of the initial approval , the CH@@ MP occurred the fact that the benefit @-@ risk ratio remains positive for ambient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Ambi@@ rix was only transferred to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of low patient .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with a complete end@@ or disorder or hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed by food , mixed with a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ac ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nos@@ son@@ ic ( through the nose into the stomach ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Ammon@@ ites could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo medication that could be compared without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ium may also lead to loss of appet@@ ite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , lack of depression , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ ac values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the disease of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with which a complete end@@ omet@@ ion gel already manif@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with late @-@ manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ no , which manif@@ ests itself after the first life @-@ month ) consists of an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low the tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated into account of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
following clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of meth@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ let , or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ let , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ synthetic vitamin deficiency need to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a is , when the tablets are not immediately possible in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which meets the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and with sodium re@@ tention and eyel@@ ids .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs on the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat of young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed maturity of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during a halt ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an unlikely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic patient which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ e@@ mia , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ph@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred within a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) at an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms undergo accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which showed a dos@@ ing limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed active connection , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea . both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ um glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ ed form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in Neu@@ bor@@ hood was earlier almost always inf@@ ectious , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues in the first year of life to death .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , uti@@ lization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ er@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated kan@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to increase diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time for many mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle , hem@@ ost@@ asis , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat .
after an oral one dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking a measur@@ able plasma center of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were established .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ press@@ ors , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in the plasma was demon@@ stra@@ ble .
three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no scler@@ a effects of toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( babies and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ac or a nos@@ son@@ de .
following clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg as well as for adults and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of meth@@ yl phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ let , or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ let , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
an unlikely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic patient which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ e@@ mia , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ph@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea . both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine therefore is suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle , the phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ um glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versi@@ bly , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state can occur .
after an oral one dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma centr@@ ations were found by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they accum@@ ulate the nutri@@ ent @-@ containing proteins in the body after consuming proteins in the body .
if you are interested in laboratory studies , you must tell the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
in case of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients suffering from a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ial to prevent a clas@@ p ) and they received another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - at preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ visions ) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other stags or one of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin for the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . permission for the traffic of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ ra@@ in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency handle or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous connection of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence , additional Bol@@ us should be given an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be taken up of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous imp@@ lication of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to under 225 seconds , a second draw of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be carefully administered intraven@@ ously and the Bol@@ us@@ um should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be taken again and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ cans check again .
in patients with severe kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which was included in the phase II , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be led 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous application of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of lower Hep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or higher bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible hyper@@ ton@@ ia . • heavy un@@ controlled bacterial En@@ do@@ car@@ dit@@ is . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though at PCI patient under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding can occur in arter@@ ial point points , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment can occur anywhere bleeding throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taken war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should have a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after finishing treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was achieved once again prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or plat@@ el@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ s@@ em@@ mer ) , can increase the risk of blood cells .
in combination of bi@@ valent Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , with plat@@ el@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti @-@ oxid@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis is perio@@ dic@@ ally control in any case .

the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients that undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Group as well as in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin was more common in women and patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less often than in the comparison group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are summar@@ ised in table 6 according to system components .
in case of over@@ dose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately to cancel and monitor the patient in relation to signs of ble@@ aching .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in , which binds both at the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on the Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn slowly out the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 which thus generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with ser@@ um of patients , in which the Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis @-@ induced thro@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced to in@@ duce no plat@@ el@@ ets of ag@@ gregation .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh , or the upper arm , or administered as a constant in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regul@@ ate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and more shorter than a short @-@ term human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin produced in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ st@@ ator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.0@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.0@@ 14 % at insulin delivery time .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lower@@ ing of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % in human normal stand@@ ings .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who have already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted possibly , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve the traffic of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the field of abdominal cav@@ ity .
due to dimin@@ ished glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with restri@@ ction of the liver function .
any change of effects , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change from insulin .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or break@@ age of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ able diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially vi@@ vi@@ able .
conversion of a patient on another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under str@@ ingent medical supervision and may make a change in the dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at change@@ over of the treatment schem@@ as .
to increase the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , fluor@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , mono@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ics , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiot@@ ics .
additionally , under the effect of symp@@ a@@ oly@@ tics such as bed loos@@ ening , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves , should be weak@@ ened or absent symptoms of no@@ rep@@ in@@ ating counter@@ act .
experimental studies on re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ate icity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ization regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin occurs in the breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ated according to oral application .
listed below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; ) : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the electric data is not estimated ) .

li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ y Will fails to change the injection point within the injec@@ tions process can occur in the sequence of a li@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics with consciousness can be given by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 m@@ g. ) , which will be given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly prescribed by glucose by a doctor .
after a succ@@ essive injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of urine for the heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose consumption ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ - be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em regular basis .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years , insulin @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ diabetes , showed a proportional dose of dose of 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a propor@@ tioned dose of glu@@ eing effect , precisely like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast response entry like normal human insulin and achieves a complete glu@@ es@@ cent effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data on an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post @-@ ran@@ di@@ cal gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as a normal regular basis , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
was gro@@ unded in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal control was given as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if the insulin delivery occurs in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mar@@ es before meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a gift for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the start of a meal , which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at the beginning of the meal 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human@@ ized Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
