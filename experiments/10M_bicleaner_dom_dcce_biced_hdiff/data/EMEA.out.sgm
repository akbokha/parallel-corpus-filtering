<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tray (tablets, which dissolve in mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. work thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disease in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treating moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients that have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of unrest unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral receipt of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or to use the melting tablets in patients, which make the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who use other medicines at the same time are degraded the same as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitter," "" "i.e. chemical substances which enable communication to the nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably known primarily as "partial aggression" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprozol means such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and Dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter seems to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms to be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, preventing the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared with two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo who had been stabilized in 160 patients, where the manic symptoms had been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from increased unrest (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablet and the solution to absorb (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased unrest than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar to as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), vomiting (dizziness), vomiting (dizziness), vomiting (dizziness), vomiting (gravitation), vomiting (gravitation), vomiting and exhaustion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-severe incidents in patients who had mainly manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprozol in which the risks were overweight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injecting solution in rapid control of unrest and behavioural problems with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at bipolar-I disorder if a oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the European Commission of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for immigration of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients that had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprozol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered, if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is placed in combination therapy, the Aripipezol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suiciencies belongs to psychotic conditions and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing a antipsychotic therapy also reported in treatment with Aripiprozol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have increased risk of risk with Aripiprozole in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial insufficiency, cardiac insufficiency, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure sensory drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 spätdyskinesies: in clinical trials which used a year or less, occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripiprozol occurring dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients were treated with ABILIFY patient signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be drawn in vomit, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms developed on a mn, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprozol should be used in patients with scratches in the Anamnese or at states that are linked with varicuous seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) suffering from Aripipezol in patients with psychosis which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripipezol in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events treated with Aripiprozol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with cetoazide or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients suffering from atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment regarding hyperglycemia-related events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic substances treated patients that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphenie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be periodically monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprozol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprozol is used in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines such as seals (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidine, a Magic acid blocker, decreases the resignation rate of Aripiprozol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripipezol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be similar dosing reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'Poor') Metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma centurities of Aripiprozol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one draws the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, might have similar effects, and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the dosing height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Aripiazza concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprozol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextrometorphan / 3-methodological morphine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprozol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation regarding the human being and due to the concerns relating to the animal's reproductive studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients should be warned of, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripipezole has no negative influence whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) as under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripipezol (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinakia, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprozol treatment and 13.1% were under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% were treated with patients who were treated with Aripipezol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I-Disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripipezol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprozol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term development phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprozol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprozol and placebo in which potentially clinically controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases Cpk (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprozol patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence as also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol, late-cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia cases, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, inintentional or deliberate overdose associated with Aripiprozol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprozole, however, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is, since Aripiprozol has a high level of plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprozol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disturbance relating to the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol in vitro showed high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1 repinator and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazol in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg. a day over 2 weeks to healthy subjects showed a dosing-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at Putin's coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week of Haloperidol controlled trial, 52% of the Responsibility patients who contributed to study medication, similar to both groups (Aripiprozol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depressions scale showed significantly higher improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprozole group and at 57% were under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients was involved in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approximately 5,6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with a flexible dose of 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disturbance Aripiprozol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo-I-disorder.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disturbance, Aripiprozole showed no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and actively controlled Monotherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-interference, with or without psychotic traits, showed Aripiprozol a placebo over placebo in week 3 and a durable effect that comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol also reported a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychological features, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprozol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension of over 74 weeks in some cases, Aripiprozole showed a remission compared to placebo for prevention of a bipolar reunion, mainly when prevention of a bipolar reaction.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes are CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydrial and hydroxyation of Aripiprozole, which is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average eliminationshal period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in case of extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours at 'poor' (= 'Poor') Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprozol there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any reference to clinically significant differences in ethnicism or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprozol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprozol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) demonstrated no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, reproductive anicity, genotoxicity and to canistogeneous potential failed to recognize the pre-clinical data for human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only by dosages or expositions which has exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no significance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects are controlled by a dosing-level-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cells) in rats after 104 weeks at 20-60 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose in humans) at 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelixasis was established as a result of the precipitation of hydroxycyczol in the Galle of aparthropzol in the Galle of apes after repeated oral-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended adult dose or 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. a concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripipezol were no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far under the limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most distinctive hematological toxicity (in 79% of patients reported) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; Leucopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects are outlined in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy occurred in every dose and indication of studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactose vase in the blood, increased blood sugar in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in blood diseases:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagie, blossoms, tongue, dry mouth, pain of the gums, loose chair, ecophagitis, pain in the mouth, oral pain, mental pain, refractal bleeding diseases of kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the breast wall, weakness of the musculature, pain pain, pain pains, pain in the skeletal musculature, flawless pain, discomfort in the links, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity will be calculated based on a definite fall in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual frequency, and no causal relation to these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules that stabilizes the merging of the microtubules from tubulations and stabilized the microtubules through inhibition of their dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubbular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies proves that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport by gp-60-Albumininreceptor is conveyed and due to the albuminant protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of tumor occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unanimous blinded studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with preventive reaction to prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an affecting overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 Metastasestals.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously had no chemotherapy yet, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% due to metastases and to adjuvant treatment.</seg>

<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity opposite to Paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who had a periphic neuropathy degree 3 evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for sealing on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 therapy courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmaceutical application of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The resulting dimensions (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to an intravenous gift of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma centration took place in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a far-reaching external distribution and / or soft connection of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokineal properties of Paclitaxel has been compared after intravenous 30-minute injection of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gift (43%) and a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histories is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized - with two smaller metabolic (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihylitaxel) metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value of less than 1% of the total total dose of less than 1% of the metabolism of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, resulting in a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which in connection with blood transfusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible, and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor which has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses, for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own bleeding, Abseamed is to inject into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his advisory person, if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilites in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to control in front of treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and ice-resistant should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems may cause anemia caused by a erythropoietinmangel or caused that the body does not adequately address the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell where a gene has been introduced to a gene (DNA) that enabled it to the formation of epoxalfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection as an injection of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by renal problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks prior to Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either switched to Abseamed or Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indistator for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobin between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of the effects of Eprex / Erypo were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems, hemogloopbination of patients, which were converted to Abseamed, were given to the same extent as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast, patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise of blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, migraine, migraine, headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against epoxalfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are necessary to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) concluded that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and effectiveness profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the Abseamed, will provide information for medical specialists in all Member States information, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma, or multiplem myeloma, obtained chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion (for example, cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy) is made.</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron mangel), if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned greater operational intervention, which require a large blood volume rate (4 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">As a reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used to be used in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfugal applications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml. can not be applied to an autologous bleeding program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentrations lie between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pädiatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Adverse symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemogglobins to more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin results can occasionally be observed in one patient or under hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to reach 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l) should be reached.</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin is inclined by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the lasting hemogloopbinis exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be superbly monitored to ensure that epetetyfa is in the lowest recommended dose which is required for control of anaemia and anabmiesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients, in which initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses higher than patients, in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times per week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times per week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to reach 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l) should be reached.</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be superbly monitored to ensure that epetetyfa is in the lowest recommended dose which is required for controlling the antimesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin's value of at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the retikulozyginal number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained daily from 150 to E. / kg three times a week or 450 i.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increases &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticlopriot of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.U. / kg three times per week of hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticloidal cytenant increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained daily from 300 to E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">In contrast, hemogloopbinis increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticlopriot of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoxetalfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-assortment of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required, Absewed in a dose of 600 i.E. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to operating procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of autologous blood-endeavage program - so that before the beginning of the Abseamed therapy there are large iron reserves available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dose is 600 i.E. / kg epoxalfa, which once weekly has been given weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of the surgery (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Here, epoxalfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis hose over the hose of a fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who have ill in treating any Erythropoetin on a erythroblastopenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA), should not receive an abomile or another Erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenia).</seg>

<seg id="409">In patients who are envisaged for a greater electrical donor procedure, the application of epoxalfa is contraindicated by an autologous heart disease, periphere arterial disease, periphere arterial disease, periphere arterial disease, periphic disorder or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently received heart attack or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of a antibody assaulted PRCA to monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous Erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">Patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of hemoglobin (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand on transfusions, should be investigated for non-contact (ice-acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum flotation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulopriot value is normal, taking into account of anemia (i.e., &lt; 20,000 / mm3, or &lt; 0.5%), whereas the platelbocyten- and leukocytente are normally found, and if no other reason is detected, the anti-erythropoetin-antibodies should be considered by the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed for patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 If patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not exceed the recommended limit of hemoglobin al concentration in paragraph 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events have been observed when erythropoese stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin- target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits that is due to the gift of epoxy symptoms, when hemoglobin concentration on the control of antimesysymptoms and avoiding blood transfusions required concentration is increased.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidence of coronary heart failure or dust-sufficiency should not exceed the recommended limit of hemoglobin al concentration in paragraph 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to present knowledge is caused by treatment of anaemia with epoxalfa in adults with renal insufficiency which are still not dialyed, the progression of renal insufficiency does not speed.</seg>
<seg id="420">For cancer patients with chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of therapy efficiency of epoxalfa a 2 - 3-week delay between epetine-alfa drugs and the Erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfunct).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l) to minimize the risk of possible thrombal events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapieconditional anaemia - dosing value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit of risk considering the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisioned for a greater electrical orthopedic procedure, if possible, prior to the epoxetalfa therapy, the cause of anemia should be investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who receive a greater electrical orthopetic procedure should receive a reasonable risk of thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have increased risk of thrombotic and vasculturally diseases, especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoxalfa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vasculular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, Epoetine did not prove that they enhance overall survival at tumor patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received chemotherapy lead back when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was streamed.</seg>
<seg id="428">When epoxalfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosis needs to be adapted to the increasing hematocre.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumour bodies there are no clues on an interaction between epoxalfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vasculine events such as myocardial attacks, cerebrovascular attacks, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombals and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Erythropoetin-Treatment, so also patients under Epoetin alfa, reported.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoxalfa is a dosisdependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovasculturally events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the Erythropoetin treatment it can result in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vasculular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically obtained epoxalfa is glycosified and regarding the amino acids and carbohydrates are identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of clinical patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marksary cells that epetythropoese stimulates the erythropoese and not influenced the leukopovese.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which is explained how the Committee for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) has conducted the studies in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not displayed. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin alone can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfylharnide or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharngels or insulin can be maintained except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfylharngels or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be recycled, and the blood sugar level drops better, thereby reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycoylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a donation of HbA1c-value to conclude that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial therapy, the effect of the additional application of Actos in the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylharnide showed itself in a lowering of the HbA1c values by 0,94% while the supplementary gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acettos and insulin had been investigated, the patients who participated in addition to insulin, received a reduction of HbA1c values from 0.69% to 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who took a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were optic nerve, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hyloanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritations).</seg>
<seg id="760">Account may not be used in patients who may react adequately (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoazide (high ketones) - acacious (in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in general use) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, where Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission announced the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited providing permission for the traffic of Actos in the whole of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate in which metformin due to contraindications (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and oil to be observed when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, a rise in reports about congestive heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output Liver (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard range) or with other signs of liver disease must not be used in Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range, the liver cancers are as soon as possible again.</seg>

<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon continued, should be directed by the laboratory parameters by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dosisdependent weight gain was detected, which may stir in fatty deposits and is associated with liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemogat, the therapy with Pioglitazone occurred a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemogglobins by 3-4%) and to a lower extent also in patients under sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction in hemogglobins to 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>

<seg id="781">In a summary of analysis of adverse events regarding bone marquarries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur was 1.9 Fractures per 100 patient years with the women of Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women, who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated at 44 / 70 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy, or this entry is the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interaction have shown that Pioglitazon does not affect the relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to diagnosing hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistence in pregnancy and increased the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth rate.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the index-index of the lens as they can also be observed in other hypoglyricots.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents performed on the triple-edge of the norm range often as on placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macular disease, the frequency of a severe heart failure in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzan</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more frequently when Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone marquarries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated in treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparatively medically treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of running PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">With intake of the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, followed by 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to act on a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), leading to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in the case of a insulin-resistence.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the treatment of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was treated by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adequately adjusted, despite a threonatized optimisation phase, randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients that continued only insulin; reducing insulin treatment in the group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies of one year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotient showed a statistically significant decline in the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks study conducted at type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma cholesterol and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as minor, but clinically significant increased LDL- cholesterol is observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the post-triglyceride level, but also improved on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular disease were randomised in groups using either a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy in either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is resorated quickly, whereby the peak concentration on unmodified Pioglitazone is usually done 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV exceeds the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone (an inhibitor cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases and reduces the plasma center of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive inflated pioglitazon in humans, marker has been found mainly in barrels (55%) and a lower extent in the resin (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unaltered Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours when humans are 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolic ratio is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centrations of Pioglitazon and his Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, but resemble the oral Clearance of the parent's substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated appointment, plasma volume augmentation, anemia and reversibly excentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to diagnosing hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistence on the breast and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth rate.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of about 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated at 44 / 70 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of more than two years, the effects of combination therapy of Metformin each with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies of 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotient showed a statistically significant decline in the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, both on a effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as to the conical tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study was presented in 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indistator of efficacy was the number of patients, in which transplant was cancelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, how often a renewed organtransplant or rerecording of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and investigated as Advagraf in comparison to prograf / prograft is absorbed by the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors, who are familiar with immunosusive therapy and treatment of transplants should be attributed to this medicine or make changes in immunosusive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in Systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmunoguppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; formulation of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the engaging control of one in the transplantation. (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative wording, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosing adjustments must be performed to ensure systematic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of repulsive and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus-Talmirror should be controlled from the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Other means of dosing can be required later, as the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus can be changed during the stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosing recommendation - liver transplantation prophylaxis of transplantation The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosing recommended dose - switch from Prograf to Advagraf have a graft of daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf. thus, this changeover in relation to a daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After a changeover from other immunosuressiva on Advaginas every day has to begin treatment with recommended oral and liver transplantation recommended oral initiation for the prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation in adult patients who are at Advaginas is to take an oral initiation of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant care recipient though there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in an oral initiation dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancreastal transplantation in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with bowel transplantation in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosing in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dosing adaption is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including regular determination of the serum-inine mirror, a calculation of the creatine and monitoring of the urinary tract) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on Advagraf At the conversion of a Ciclosporin on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley levels in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of repulsive and tolerability in individual cases under aid of full blood-Tacrolimus-Talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf at Advagraf, dose adaptation, changes in immunosusive therapy or for simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf a drug with a low clearing is, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley levels of Tacrolimus are usually in the first time after liver transplantation usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in nursing and hearttransplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac disease, usually blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events, including transplantation or other side effects, which can occur in sequence of Tacrolimus or overflow.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; formulation of formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the engaging control of one in the transplantation. (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1443">Due to possible interaction, which can lead to a reduction of the clinical effects of Tacrolimus, the consumption of herbal supplements, which may contain currant wort (hypericum perforatum), or other plant healing during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, the chamber or septic hypertrophy occured in rare cases, thus can be observed under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with coriosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid loading, and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like in other immunosuppressants, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of sun protection using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal medicinal products known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect or lower the metabolism of Tacrolimus, and thus lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels in the same gift of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain equivalent concentration levels (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1454">High-dosire prednisolon or methylprednisolone, as it is used for acute abulsive reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of acrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4, can affect their metabolism.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the first authorisation available, CHMP has continued to consider the benefit risk factor being positively evaluated, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of safety filter by ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs all 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited submitted to the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP), the company officially receded its application for authorisation of an advocating of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues, which combines other structures in the body, surrounds and rests) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "with the virus in Advexin, it is a" "" "Adenovirus" "" "which has been so altered that there is no copies of itself, and thus cannot solve infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have to be injected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from the non deficient in the human body's p53 gene, normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study with a patient before the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of subtree, in bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP reviewed the company's answers to the answer, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the test of initially submitted documents, the CHMP has provided a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors will bring benefits to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the treatment of drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that Advexin can be made in a reliable way, and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocrisp, induced inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal skin swellation (clocking nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clog nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be refusing on the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficiency measures were the severity of the severity of the hypocre symptoms that were reported in the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">With regard of all the hypocre symptoms except for the caching of the nose reported the patients that Aerinaze's income reported about a decrease of symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who pose Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed alleviation of symptoms by 37,4% vs 26,7% in the patients receiving Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykardie (throat level), constipation, mental pain, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnia (insomnia), somnia (insomnia), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze should not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or one of the other components, against repinconceige agents or Loratadine (another medicine to treat allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyroose (hypertension), hyperthyroose (overfunction of thyroid) or have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by brainous bleeding) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission announced its approval by SP Europe to approve the traffic of Aerinaze in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if necessary to swallow (i.e. without biting or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied for children under 12 years due to the lack of data regarding the lack of data and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take off time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decreasing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine also is contraindicated in patients suffering from a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimtic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine, Pergoid, Lisurid, ergotamine, ergotamine, ergotamine, ergotamin, ergotopamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, ephedrine, nianolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient-collective, and the data will not submit to appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data do not submit to corresponding recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients need to be informed about the treatment of occurrence of hypertonia or a speedometer, heart rhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a amplification of the headaches) must be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups to be careful: • Patients under digitalis • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchospasm in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamine is otherwise able to prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with Desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadine and the placebo treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadine is not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 did not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The intruthfulness of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the basis of vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified above that it may occur in very rare cases, which may lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (seals, Apnea, diminished intellectual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular deaps) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor) with possible lettering.</seg>

<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil starre and - diatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia, gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the release of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile as well as inhibition of expression of the expression of the adhesion connector P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance, including reinforcement subjective impacts or duties which are linked to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer, or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergies, whereby 414 patients Aerinaze tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determines from the overall cores for symptoms (except nasal sskin swellation), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine across the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets in relation to the swelling effect, determines from the nasal sinal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for Pharmacokinetics of Aerinfertility, Desloratadine is demonstrable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers on 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of an pharmacokinetic multi-doscope study, which was conducted with formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, was noted that four subjects of Desloratadin was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component intervention study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to the general gift of Pseudoephedrine in the exposition to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, for toxicoxicity and for reproduction, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadine can not recognise any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-fiction studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not weighed in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by the alteration of symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to insert and the melting tablet in the same way is devaluable as the tablets and use in children are harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg acerius became an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1727">Asterius may not be used in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval for the marketing of Aerial us throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of Desloratadin during teenagers from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of an intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to the symptoms of previous disease and may be resumed after the end of the symptoms and will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergy-allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients may be recommended for continuous treatment throughout the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were observed in the framework of clinical trials with Desloratadine tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically-pharmacological study, the effect of alcohol and alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it may lead to impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials of various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urine, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with asterius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects, which was reported more frequently than in placebo, fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%) were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect of the headache was treated with 5,9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine, and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg Desloratadine (nineteen clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile as well as inhibition of expression of the expression of the adhesion body P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple sclerosis in the desloratadine, a dose of up to 20 mg daily was administered over 14 days a day, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the Desloratadine, in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was given over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1743">For a single dosing study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes, including reinforcement subjective impacts or duties which are linked to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, agerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as nib, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, trash, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms, alternatively in intermitting allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermitting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As on the basis of the whole questionnaire based on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was evidenounced for further forms of the Urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology, in different forms, is similar to the different forms and can be recruited by chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is a causal factor in all urinary diseases, is expected that Desloratadine is also carried out in other forms of the Urtikaria to improve symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guides.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urine was Aerial us effective in enhancing Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of addling at the end of the first dosing intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic Urtikaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the increase in volume of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with anerius reduced the disturbance of sleeping and growth significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients Demographies were comparable to the general seasonal Rhinitis population, 4% of patients received a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for a clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine is not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits non-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single doscope study with Desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The pre-clinical trials performed with Desloratadine and Loratadin, with a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity of Desloratadin and from Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity and for reproduction, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadine do not recognise any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerial us can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis is caused by infection for children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that no data is present, which support treatment of infectious rhinitis with anerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies, should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolized - Desloratadin limited and experienced a higher substrate (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which could cause a future pandemic to safeguard a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the Grippevirus arises, that can easily spread from man to person because humans have not constructed immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus as "bodily" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Grippevirus of this Stamina faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then the diaphragm of the virus was removed with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the diaphragm surface, which detects the human body as bodily), cleaned and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1921">As in other medicines for HIV, HIV is taking care of patients who are taking care of a lioystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteoecrosis (symptoms of infection) or an immunodeficiency syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Aboase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risk.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Aboase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee set out that the use of Aboase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously no protease inhibitor is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Aboase was originally approved under "outstanding circumstances" as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to approve the traffic of Aboase in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aboase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treating HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) of treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Asperase is supposed to be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of ammatavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ammatavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ammatavir as a solution to intake is reduced by 14% less than one capsule; therefore, aspirin capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Aboase capsules is 600 mg of ammatavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Aboase has been used without the enhancing additive of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied at Aboase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Aboase capsules is 20 mg of amatavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily most maximum dose of 2400 mg amatavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Aboase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Arease is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data relating to impunity and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg capsules with severe liver function to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function in 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or regular liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Arease may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also indicate substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the currant wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk reduction of reduced plasma centurines and a reduced therapeutic effect of ammatavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Arease or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to cure HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aspirase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Aboase is supposed to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous tiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the related information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis are showing an increased frequency of liver function in antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Aboase and Ritonavir with Fluticone or other glucooids, which can be induced via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic coriosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and repression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the refining of the HMG-CoA-reductase of the HMG-Coastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on the iGenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalisation Ratio), methods are available for determining the active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these medicines at the same time, Aboase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of ammatavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with ammatavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amplisr, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentatory symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity caused by the high propylation of toxicity, this loan form has been contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with care of certain patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Arease should be placed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including Protease inhibitors, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exazerbation of existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses, their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hämophile patients (Type A and B), which were treated with proteases, are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematology and hemorthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency therapy (ART), a anti-antiretroviral therapy (ART) can evolve to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of cortiosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe body mass index), cases of osteoekrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Arease may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also indicate substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Aboase with Ritonavir may not be given together with drugs, whose mechanisms are mainly controlled via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in AUC of ammatavir, which can lead to a viadrological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to increase the harvested plasma level by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, have been observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be performed by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with currant wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient takes already St. John's wort, the amplavirmirror is and if possible to check the viral load and add the cursor's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosing adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary if cfinavir is administered along with amocavir (see also Ecosirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase for temperatures by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with ammatavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, dosages of 600 mg of ammatavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and thoughtfulness of this treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% drifting if ampercais (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg choonavir twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amperavir in the plasma, which have been reached twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg arraviolr twice daily), are approx. 40 to 50% lower than if amperavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for simultaneous administration of amniavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there is not a close monitoring as the efficacy and nonsense of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used in combination with didanosin, but is recommended due to the antacids component of Didanosin, however, that the revenues of Didanosin and Aboase are at least one hour (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amplisency in combination with amplisr (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dosing adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with emirency in combination with amplisr and saquinta is not recommended as the exposure of both prostheses would be deathed.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other Protease inhibitors and existing data suggest that Nevirapine might be sunk into the serum concentration of ammatavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine should be used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology monitoring is supposed to be made, as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of ammatavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ammatavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin around 193%, thus increasing side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin together with Aboase is required to reduce the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with carbiase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma level of both medicines could be increased by both drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole in the plasma once daily, which was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without any simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that can be listed below, including substrates, inhibitor, or inductors of CYP3A4, can result in common to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with aspirase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other Protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids cannot be taken at the same time as Above, as it can come to resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulva that are known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amoavir can lead to a humiliation of plasma cutting of ammatavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium blockages such as amlodipin, didipin, tidipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by ammatavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Aboase can increase the plasma centrations and amplify the side effects, including PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotics, visual disturbances, and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg Fluticonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily), while the endogenous caortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -Konfidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Aboase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these Glukocotikoids, unless the potential benefits of treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cortical correlation (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin which depends heavily from CYP3A4, are more pronounced increases of plasma cutting at the same administration of aGenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma increases of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor for Myopathy including a Rhabometyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended for stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma centuric of cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolim can be increased in the same gift of ammatavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, caregase should not be applied along with orally attached midazolam (see section 4.3) while on the same application of asonase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam to 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with ammatavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentatory symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the small comparability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the same time, as the amplisite is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulation together with Arease, a stronger control of INR (International Normalisation Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraventiva is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the same gift of Aboase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactic rats, ammatavir-related substances were found, however, it is not known whether ampercavir passes into the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the niotic power in the uterus to the end of the lactation, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight during postage.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of earnings including fertilisation and reproduction was not affected by the administration of amniavir to the motherly.</seg>
<seg id="2003">In adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-related side effects of side effects were light up to moderately marked, rates up early and rarely were led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified if they are involved in relation to the ingestion or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients were not treated twice daily with protease inhibitors twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) reported by the investigator as in connection with the study medication, and in more than 1% of patients showed, and also under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral therapy therapy is associated with a redistribution of body fat (lioystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of oidal and faecal fat tissues, increased intraabdominals and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat collection (Sticker).</seg>
<seg id="2009">In the 113, antiretroviral non-treated persons who had been treated with Amendavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin has been treated for a medium duration of 36 weeks (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients (3%) in less than 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs about a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin precipitation were usually mild to moderately balanced, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and disappeared spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without having the treatment with ammatavik had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoekarsis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency therapy (ART), a anti-antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflamviral reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients treated with PI pretreated patients, which were 600 mg of carbiase twice daily with low dosified Ritonavir (degrees 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were associated with rheumatoid ceride and Cpk values, which were associated with low dosified Ritonavir, which were very common.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose the patient is observed on signs of a toxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures are included.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amplisr binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the procurement of viral gag- and gag-polarization steps with the result of a formation unripe, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of ammatavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amniavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of ammatavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - like in other Ritonavir deoostered treatment schemas with proteinase inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients that have received 700mg arosamptavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a viadrological failure occurred to week 48 where 14 isolate genotypic could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 from 14 children, in which a viadrological failure occurred within the 59 patients, showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg choonavir twice daily: n = 107), patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Analysis based analysis of genotypic interpretational systems can be used to estimate the activity of amatavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I52V, I82A / C / C / G / C / S / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / G / C / C / G / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C / C / G / C / C</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to keep up the current interpretational systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenomenal resistance testing laboratory testing systems Klinically validated phenotypic interpretations can be used in combination with the genotypic data for the assessment of activity of amatavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistent isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to distribute diagnostic resistance tests, clinically designed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amplisr associated genetic samples produces a certain cross-resistence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinta.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistence between amatavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance class, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroanti-viral infections (one of them reported a resistance to atisavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), caviavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), caviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinta / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amdetavir reserves its activity against some other protease-resistant isolate; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a different therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that can affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Aboase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC), with an PI, predominantly with low-rate Knight-avir "" "," received. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundredth three and threescore (n = 163) patients with imbalances of viral sensitivity, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the default value of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-genotype of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The efficacy of the effectiveness of unbundled Aboase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 had been treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Aboase has been tested for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) who administered NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered in the therapeutic optimisation of the benefits of "unbundoostered" aspirin. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the maximum length (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of ammatavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) along with amniavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ammatavir with a meal lead to a 25% decline in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ammatavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) has remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous nutritional intake implies the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to about 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of ammatavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of active concentration in the plasma, although the amount of unbound ammatavir, which remains the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of inbound ammatavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active ingredients during the dosing intervalls occur in dependence on the total concentration of the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that CYP3A4 must induce or inhibate or a substrate of CYP3A4 should be given to caution when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Aboase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amatavial-exposure to adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ammatavir is made from the solution 14% less biopoable as of the capsules; therefore Arease solution and carve capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal dysfunction is likely to be low-elimination of ammatavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to ammatavir plasma screens similar to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of ammatavir twice a day without any administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity for mice and rats occurred in male animals, adenoma in doses of dosages, which were two times daily (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of ammatavir.</seg>

<seg id="2216">These clinical signs submitted by clinical evidence shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies involving Imiquimod-cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythem (61%), erosion / scandal (14%) and Ödem (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs is shown that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream very common to severe erytopics (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and severe damage (19%) came.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials involved in the application of Imiquimod, Alopezie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time recording of 200 mg Imiquimod which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Following the topical application of Imiquimod, an increasing systemic concentration of the alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the Feigniod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of all patients with Imiquimod therapeutically healed the cowardians completely; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A full curative healing could be achieved at 23% from 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Histologically confirmed the primary superfiant basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data shown from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI] (73.7%, 84.9%) were treated clinically and it remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Efficacy of Imiquimod has three weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic, not hypertrophic acts within a related 25 cm2 of treatment areas on the hairless scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Results from two combined observation studies show patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external feigning, actinic keratosis and superfizial basal cell carcinoma occur normally in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies the effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic recording of the 5% Imiquimod-cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during three weeks of weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated clutterance time was about 10times higher than the 2hour half-time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod has been low after topical application at MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superfimantic basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at the rat no doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; one also carried out a four-month study to dermal application with the mouse yielded no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with three days a week do not induced tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of human skin and not mutagen, is a risk for people due to systemic exposure to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors came in the mice associated with the real-free cream, earlier and in greater numbers on than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you have. − If any of the observed side effects you have considerably impaired or you have noticed side effects which are not specified in this manual information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata), formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (genital organs) and the anus (anus) have a very important, slow growing shape of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to entities, especially in the face - hence a fruit recognition and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Tintinic keratosis are rough areas of the skin, which occur in people during their previous life much of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in shallow keratitis in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the best suitable treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system with the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the infection with incliners responsible.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used to use Aldara cream or other, similar samples before you start using your doctor. o Informing your doctor if you are having problems with your immune system. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and nasal mucosa.</seg>

<seg id="2252">Apply Aldara cream in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines caused severe problems with your immune system, you should use this medicine for no more than a treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with incliners in genital sexual intercourse, treatment with Aldara cream is to be performed after sexual intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you apply other medicines or used recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeeding your infant during the treatment with Aldara cream is not known, because Imiquimod takes over into the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different with incliners, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on clean, dry skin with the incliners and rub the cream carefully on the skin, until the cream is completely covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowardians under the foreskin must remove the foreskin every day and carefully wash the skin area (see section 2 "What must you consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please contact your doctor or pharmacist when you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks each week, apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A serious number of blood cells may make you susceptible to infections, and it can result in you quicker a blue stain or she can cause dispensity.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the adverse events you have significantly impaired or you have noticed side effects which are not specified in this manual information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can find itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas where you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most often it is easier to lighten skin reactions, which will resend in about 2 weeks after finishing the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Sometimes some patients notice changes at the application place (secretion, inflammation, swelling, skin cells, dermatitis, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes to the application place (bluffing, inflammation, wound or distraction), inflammation of the nasal skin, cervical pain, diarrhea, actintic keratosis, redness, headache, sounding pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is applied to patients with a diagnosis of a Muolysaccharide I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency), in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means certain substances (glyphaminoglyphs, gags) do not be dismantled and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage it.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following nonneurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, difficult movements, diminished lung volume, heart and lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with revitalizing equipment, and the patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, but it was also measured up its effectiveness (in relation to reducing Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of the lung function), speedometer (accelerated rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not used.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is all new information that may be known, check and update this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission announced the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve the traffic of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Muolysaccharide I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also continue to be monitored continuously, and infusion of Aldurazyme should be made available only in a reasonable clinical environment, where revitalizing equipment for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibody against laronidase are expected, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when used by Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break is due, due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment has to be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or anti-pyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen was considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate on the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion has to be stopped, until the symptoms are reduced to decline, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with the reduction of infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which has occurred in the preceding reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies will not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic and fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exposed to laronidase on breast milk, is recommended to satisfy, during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were classified mainly as infusion-related reactions which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older, are listed in the following table after the following common frequencies: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in preliminary history, bronchospasm, respiratory and facial tonality (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 trial with 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly heavy trapped form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a serokonversion within 3 months after the treatment of a serokonversion, with a heavy-run shape mostly within one month to a serokonversion (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 trial (respectively up to an early retirement of the study) amounted to 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, among them 3 patients who never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibodies for a solid decrease in the urine, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of Gag in Harn was found.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginally to the enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesired drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the reduction of an accumulation is sufficient to restore the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly absorbed from the cycle and absorbed by cells to the Lysosomes, the most likely about Mannose-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients received from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forged expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy was the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme is an improvement of lung function and the inability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant, and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with an hepatocyst treatment (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the Gag-mirror in the resin (µg / mg of creatinine) was established, which remained constant for the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients that sums up by using a combined end score, the clinically significant changes were summarised for five effectiveness (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted primarily to investigate security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients (16 patients with heavy digestive form and 4 with the mean veraging form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased risk of GAG- Mirrors in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for these age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean depression form a normal mental development process, whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamics effects of different Aldurazyme-dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag-Spiegel in the Harn, the liver volume, and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, but is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at one-time gift, toxicity at repeated gift and reproduction, the pre-clinical data can not recognise any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed to its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigated for the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioma in a main study of 456 patients who previously had no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta has also compared gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary Do- SIS is collected and diluted with 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin to first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of Cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion in the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-single bronchoral cancer, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Reduction of frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift, and on the day after the treatment a corpus eroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose, Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetrexed dosage as well as after each third closing cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">Patients who receive Pemetrexed should be created before every gift a complete blood pattern was created, including a differentiation of the leukocyte and a platelbow.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosing test must take place under correction of the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the pre-going therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients do not develop hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be broken with ALIMTA until the patient underwent value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when in patients after 2 dose-reduc- a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients at the age of 65, an increased side risk factor exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for infinity and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a creatinine-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dosing adaptions were necessary, which go beyond the dose of recommended Dosisizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a cancer-inine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function of &gt; to the 1.5 times of the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; to 3.0 times of the upper limit (in the presence of metastasis) are not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored in relation to the bone and suppression, and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before the absolute neutrophacoat reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelbow was reached again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophal numbers, platelbocytense and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 of neutropenia, neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neutropenia was beatted when a pre-treatment was taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients need to be used to use pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure for reduction-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium-insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous insteroidal anti-oxidation (NSAIDs), such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, where these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid collection, a drainage of result in front of Pemetremixed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported occasionally, if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated lives (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of an irreversible damage caused by Pemetreproof, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn should be pointed out to bring consultation on the lock services.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid antyl acid (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in a reduced Pemetrexed excretion, with the result of an increased birth of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and minding, 2 days after the therapy with passports (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with NSAIDs as long as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be prevented for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The major intra-individual variability of the state status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulanants and antinelastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Normalisation Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected during a use during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary - and after careful considering of the usefulness for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive ability is caused by Pemetreproof, men should be pointed out before the treatment course, advice regarding the spermacity barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed to the breast milk and unwanted effects of the striped infant can not be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight (body mass index BMI, 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypokalic, fetching diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and young people under 18, because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally absorbs, elderly and kidney function is not necessary for dosage with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase when alli is taken along with a fat-rich meal or fetal diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can go with improved metabolic control, patients who need to consult a medicine or pharmacist before the start of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli and medicines for hypertension or an elevated Cholesterinspiegel should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to make additional fluctuations prevention, in order to prevent any of severe diarrhoea possible failure (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with the same application of orlistat and Ciclosporin was observed a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma screens.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In use of warfarin or other oratory anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalized ratios, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotics remained in the norm range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin to ensure adequate vitamine (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a one-time dose of Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers from the same time, a minor decrease in Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of imprisoned fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events that were noted after the market launch of Orlistat is not known because these events were volunteered by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiples of up to 400 mg three times daily were given to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Cases of orlistat overdose may be reported either side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research and animal, from a rapid recovery of any systemic effects, which can be attributed to the lipasent properties of Orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect places in the lumen of magens and the upper thin intestine by covalent bonds to the active serin-rest of gastric and pancreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of orlistat is taken three times a day, absorption of about 25% of food fatty acids.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI of 60 mg / m2 cover the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalic, oily nourishing nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change in body weight compared to the initial level (at the time of Randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight (Table 1) and as part of the body weight of subjects that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their original weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss in the first 6 months was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (nominal value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (nominal value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="2542">When the waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point: 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (nominal value: 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma centrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours following the oral administration of 360 mg Orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, for therapeutic dosages, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml, or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients, which was administered at minimal systemic resorated dose, two main metaboons, namely M1 (M1 (in position 4 hydrolysikaline-Leucine) and M3 (M1) were identified according to the breakdown of the N-Formyl-Leucine Group), which showed almost 42% of the total plasmid-volume.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy; the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of alxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there are not enough information regarding the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance effect the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies on 1 842 adult, chemotherapies received a strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of patients treated with alxi had no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 81% of the patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 out of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission announces the business of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the resort of Aloxi in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting near severe chemotherapy after cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon stage, patients should be supervised with amnesty and signs of a subacute Ileus after injection-meshed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- interval is prolongs or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with an additional chemotherapeutics gift Aloxi is intreated in the days of chemotherapy neither for the prevention nor treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron does not inhibit the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady static concentration of oral metocloidal concentration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor showed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-inductors, chlorpromaine, cimetidine, icoperidol, paroxetine, quinonavir, sertrine and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies do not lie, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless it is considered necessary by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe annotal effects (a total of 633 patients) that were at least alarmed with alxi patient in connection, headaches (9%) and fruit ipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity and reactions in the administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies were similar to adverse events such as in the other doses; no dose-action relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy at an alxiation overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blindstudies, 1,132 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously given to Day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a highly emitted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were given to patients that were given at day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emitted chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the relevant effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma centrations a slow elimination from the body with an average stop time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in the entire dosing range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in the patient and cancer-patient dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) was measured between day 1 and day 5 measured (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma cutting at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total sum of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total texposition (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time release of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% of the kidneys have been eliminated and roughly another 50% are transformed into two primary metabolic zones, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on Metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After one-time intravenous bolus injection, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the exploration of hepatitis C treatment intended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injector solution was approved.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same practicable ingredient, which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long tender) Hepatitis C (a viral infection caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzymity of Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) is increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was inserted, which stimulates the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon related data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon has been compared with the efficacy of the reference guide to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "in addition there were concerns relating to the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C associated with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon retardant the disease rekindled to more patients than on the reference medicine; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test was used in the study to investigate the question of how the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crustenosis) and small insoftening infiltrations (Riss- or Schnittwunden), diced and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treating infections, which have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillinresistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not affect this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the surface area should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment two to three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial cells (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and reduces the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indistator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was reduced by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients enrolled in placebo spoke on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin problems, about 90% of both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that alargo was caused by treatment of abscesses (wholeums in body tissue) or infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo over the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, diced or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the traffic of Altargo into the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two to three days are to be considered once and an alternative therapy is considered to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitization or heavy local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspects (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary infected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered when 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low level of plasma centrations, which were achieved by people after topical application to loose skin or infected deep wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 By simultaneous gift of 2 times per day, 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean saapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on a diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosing adapts are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction according to oral ingestion and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and the federal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin salad should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo was used, was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation by the meeting, which considered approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of slingromutiline, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Purotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a particular bonds of the bacterial Ribosoms which differs from the binding alternative of other ribosomal interacts of antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binding office of the ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosom P binding office and the Peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding agent Pleuromutiline blocked the Peptidylate, partially block-binding interactions and prevent the normal education active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, retapamulin should appear in at least some infection forms should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults became 1% retapamulin ointment daily at occlusion on intakeated and on suspended skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary and traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within a two doses of existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunization has a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that it can be led to an end using two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a release dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix can be given to the Ambient or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ambirix also includes the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adv 'vaccine since 1996 and has been a Twinrix vaccine since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix Advisas and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are containing identical ingredients, some of the data which supports the application of Twinrix Advisors, also used as proof of the Ambirix application.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indistator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration camp one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix carried out a month after the last injection of hepatitis A and B for the last injection of the last injection of hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the ambient temperature was similar to the Ambirix for a six-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matity (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is allowed to react to patients that are potentially sensitive (allergic) to active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) should not be applied.</seg>

<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for basic gratization with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a release is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis-bean surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis-A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed in the same magnitude according to vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="2743">3. as with all injectionsifs, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction according to the gift of vaccines, medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization is recommended with the combination of hepatitis B, the 360 ELISA units formalinactive hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal impending success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In Throbozytopenia or blood clutational disorders, Ambirix can be injected, however, as it can occur in these cases to intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection, tetanus-, tetanus- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mascul- mumps tube, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the installation of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matches on a calculation basis per vaccinations Ambirix, but not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the ambiance of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given the Ambirix had pain, over 63.8% of the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose-combine vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of math was comparable (i.e. via the entire vaccination cycle at 39,6% of the subjects, the Ambirix were compared to 36.2% of the subjects that received the 3-doses of combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pregnating pain and permeability was low and comparable, which was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3-cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was similar to which the hepatitis B-B combined with 360 ELISA units was observed with a combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per tape, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported over severe side effects during the 2 doses of vaccas with Ambirix, or during the 3-doses of hepatitis C and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B- surface antigen, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were performed in vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, the serokonstruction rates of anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serokonstruction rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">At the time of priortization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to both antigens, which was formed according to vaccination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosing volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies comparable 24 months after immunization in 0-6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only transferred to a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of low patient.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with a complete endor disorder or hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniac concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed by food, mixed with a gastrostomiac (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nossonic (through the nose into the stomach).</seg>

<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow the tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated into account of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Following clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of methyl phosphatsynthetic or ornithinly scarlet, or ornithinly scarlet, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetic vitamin deficiency need to receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagulzera is, when the tablets are not immediately possible in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrat which meets the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency and with sodium retention and eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs on the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacetat of young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown in neuronal multiplication and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturity of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetat is excreted into the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during a halt (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An unlikely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old aneclectic patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactemia, heavier hypokalemia, phanzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred within a 5 month old toddler (1370 mg / kg) at an accidental dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms undergo accumulation of phenylacetat, which showed a dosing limiting neurotoxicity at an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetat is a metabolized active connection, conjugated by acetylated glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea. both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylum glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifested form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in Neuborhood was earlier almost always infectious, and the disease resulted in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen exertion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetat), proteinated kanost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to increase diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate of hyperammonic encephalopathy was 100%, but even in these patients it was with time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygots form of ornithinly scarce bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonic encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetat, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemostasis, and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetat.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral one dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking a measurable plasma center of phenylbutyrat were established.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic disorders or hemoglooppressors, after different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), the next morning, no phenylacetat in the plasma was demonstrable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no sclera effects of toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either orally (babies and children who can't swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastrostomiac or a nossonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">Following clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing more than 20 kg as well as for adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular, branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of methyl phosphatsynthetic or ornithinly scarlet, or ornithinly scarlet, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattenfutes were exposed to the birth of phenylacate (active metabolit of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An unlikely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old aneclectic patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactemia, heavier hypokalemia, phanzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea. both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine therefore is suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, the phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylum glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversibly, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral one dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma centrations were found by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they accumulate the nutrient-containing proteins in the body after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are interested in laboratory studies, you must tell the doctor that you can use AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) or myocardial infarction (heart attack).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients suffering from a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the arterial to prevent a clasp) and they received another medicine to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - at preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revisions) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other stags or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin for the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission adopted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. permission for the traffic of Angiox in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronarsyndromes (instabile angina / non- ST-Hebrainfarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency handle or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous connection of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another sequence, additional Bolus should be given an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg and increases infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose can be taken up of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous implication of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of administered intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus gift by Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to under 225 seconds, a second draw of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully administered intravenously and the Bolusum should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which will be subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be taken again and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Boluscans check again.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though at PCI patient under Bivalirudin, most bleeding can occur in arterial point points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI), while the treatment can occur anywhere bleeding throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, should have a monitoring of the INR-value (International Normalisation Ratio) to ensure that the value after finishing treatment with Bivalirudin was achieved once again prior to treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately to cancel and monitor the patient in relation to signs of bleaching.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudine, a direct and specific thrombin, which binds both at the catalytic center of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on the Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin turn slowly out the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 which thus generates the function of the active centre of thrombin regenerates.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the upper arm, or administered as a constant infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and more shorter than a short-term humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin produced in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was investigated in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indistator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycoylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.014% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.014% at insulin delivery time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human normal standings.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients who have already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adjusted possibly, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission adopted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve the traffic of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, the thigh or the Deltamuskels or subcutaneous in the field of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to diminished glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of effects, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change from insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakage of treatment, especially in patients with an insulable diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazide; these conditions are potentially viviable.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient on another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under stringent medical supervision and may make a change in the dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at changeover of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglyphics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, fluoroxifylline, monooxifylline, propoxyphics, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympaolytics such as bed loosening, Clonidine, Guanethidine and reserves, should be weakened or absent symptoms of norepinating counteract.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductionate icity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and humanization regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether the insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin occurs in the breast milk, nor is resorated according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10;): ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency on the basis of the electric data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, bold and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, diommenness, excessive amounts of vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lioystrophy Will fails to change the injection point within the injections process can occur in the sequence of a lioystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglyphics with consciousness can be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg.), which will be given by a correspondingly prescribed by glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a successive injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of urine for the heavy hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous gau- be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than at hu- manem regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years, insulin-1 diabetes, insulin-diabetes, showed a proportional dose of dose of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportioned dose of glueing effect, precisely like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double so fast response entry like normal human insulin and achieves a complete gluescent effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data on an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable post-randical glycaemic control is achieved as a normal regular basis, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was grounded in 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandical control was given as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If the insulin delivery occurs in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is given as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mares before meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at a gift for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of a meal, which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at the beginning of the meal 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to humanized Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
