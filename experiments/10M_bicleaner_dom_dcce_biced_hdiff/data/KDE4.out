the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier available .
for more information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings ... Open the card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de package ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; comp@@ ile before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras , you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of ab@@ rup@@ ts , if present , de@@ gl@@ aze .
the An@@ c@@ filter module ( also called the Fol@@ der filter ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras att@@ itudes . with the module you can filter up &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : &apos; document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are elements of this root canal .
the modul &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; is there to display dis@@ sident folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is portra@@ yed by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of a object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; this is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is specified . in this way , large files can be easily detected , even if they are widely detected in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX commands .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour@@ ing and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on colour mode , can be either a depth for slight detection of dis@@ appearance or the figure of another file names such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify if there is enough space for displaying , or if there are enough space for displaying , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ated means can be used . in addition , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tering in a rect@@ angle .
with representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry , and this frame is not always available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
as a division takes place an entry of an entry for sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left so far to avoid that rect@@ angle are possible . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimal displayed surface for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a pre@@ load pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually shown by an or@@ derly entry .
originally &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets thought that was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

a simple to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes a quick image processing with base processing tools . you can use them to comment and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug came ; it is easy to use , dozens of professional abilities are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the conversion by li@@ ve@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC @-@ color administ@@ rators .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to make problems of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page with a sub@@ til@@ ting link . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you are asking a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; ask here questions to other users . in this mailing list will be English , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ;
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ plug ; registration is in the developer mailing list . guidance to report in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
when you &apos;re digi@@ ous ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to specify your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply click on the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image files .
later you can add so@@ many folders like you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also use you as an Al@@ ben@@ der . settings digi@@ plug .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as base folders . no picture is changed as an album . no picture is changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ al re@@ charge the libr@@ arian ad in its entire depth . you can not exclu@@ de sub@@ folders , unless there is any hidden folder . this allows you to insert it in a hidden folder . this allows you to insert an item before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base file , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not have photos as symbols . you can then use any photos from the album and this will be used as an album icon . more details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the Base File , you can set up &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should learn how to use your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage your albums and my pictures to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ support .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ s.@@ and Ro@@ h workflow .
a simple to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are based on data transmission through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera will then be implemented as disk drive . older cameras can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , transfer@@ able software collection for digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need to additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use serial interface for their communication with the computer . da photos in general large files are slowly and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug . supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be copied with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ p@@ on . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may need thumb@@ nails or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( Manual ) is a joint approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can be manipul@@ ated in virtually any way as well as a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complement a function as changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ board with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 resp@@ . C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and lay down images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be found in keywords , file list or search .
- a file selection allows you to differenti@@ ate the more common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering works on the file name only if this ind it is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog box dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organised view on your photo albums , where they were saved on your hard disk , where they were saved on the hard disk , in which the album was created first , sorted by the album , where the album can be changed first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have installed a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a photo directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . choose the album Import screen photo .
to copy or move an album from an album to another one or move , you can move the picture with the mouse to the target album and move there . in the following menu you &apos;ll need to move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move it onto the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ features allow you to access this collection . to click on the album , click the album and select the Alb@@ um@@ properties menu with the right mouse button .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums in order to be group@@ ed under a common name , so you can select or delete albums from the tool@@ bar collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - date : is used if you sort out your albums after date with view albums after date .
the buttons El@@ el@@ dest , average , New Year : this put the date on the picture of the oldest picture , the latest image or the passage of the album . in addition , the average of pictures from their EX@@ IF data will be promp@@ ted . if this is missing , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first came out an album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; it is meant to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes you want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau quot ; . additionally , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in one collection and collections can not be missed .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections are always all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview screen , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails in the tool@@ bar .
if you can open an album the first time you will have to wait for a short time while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid it in which you can re@@ produce all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image will be shown below the associated preview . which information is , you can change over settings ; set up the albums here and custom@@ ize the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows , the release . if you have the mouse cur@@ sor over a picture above a picture . the help shows the most important features , including all tags of a photo . the screen picture above shows in the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ plug ; runs . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach any number of improvements to this . you can reach any number of improvements to preview or the menu image in the menu bar . they have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button . click on ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image processing you can view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ plug ; the functionality you need , do not need to open the context menu with the right mouse button , and select the program from the sub@@ menu with the right mouse button , and how to adapt it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information at &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should notice that it can come after processing by other image processing programs to problems with the metadata in the image . some programs do not save the modified picture . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , bling , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest option is to preview and select it with the right mouse button on preview and select . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can select with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed F8 Image Del@@ ete or ent@@ f If you prefer to really delete it , you can use it by using Shift ; un@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My date sli@@ ps ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of file .
if you select a month from the list , select all photos of this month in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et view , so that only photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keyword will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos . tags are st@@ ickers , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos taken with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ic tree . you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also find parts of the building &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; so you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easy to find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , you can also use your keywords in other programs , as soon as &amp; digi@@ plug came ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword . if you click on a new keyword , click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo is not deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by taking it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit it in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the picture in the context menu . additionally , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
um &amp; digi@@ plug ; s functionality can be done with keywords , you must first take your photos with keyword , you may click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; draw and place there . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nails on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed once you have one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have signed a photo with links , this will be shown under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photos and remove from the keyword menu . the menu displays you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows an tempor@@ ally adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame , you must click on the bottom right angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then this appears in the list below .

the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters where you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database can search .
the list of search rules are used to add the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank . all rules can be added by oper@@ ators . each option can be added with others via the logical operations all ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... link . in addition , you can also search the Type &amp; quot ; AND NEW .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by compar@@ ing these signatures . the lower difference between two screens , the more they comply with . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a section in which you can drop each picture to find a similar picture . by using a swelling can move the results of the page , then you will open it and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : open @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; find the matching pictures . here too , a swelling value can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the mar@@ ble miniature range . you can push it through the mouse button . push it through the left mouse button . push it through the left mouse button . push all images in this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is , of course , containing your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this is then added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; put a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The lighthouse is added to the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug , you can open the ligh@@ table fast with L ex@@ tras .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can compare the images you want to compare , in the left or right pane of the window . if you preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and then transfer them to one of the images , then they will compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to select from a series of images . if you can navigate directly from the tool@@ bar , then use the left mouse button in any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left hand . the right next picture is shown in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the be@@ aut@@ tically like F4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it a simple visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each range you will find a built @-@ in piv@@ ot function , which you can bend in the crossed arrows . to preview the visible range of the picture , you must click them and the L@@ MB ; then select both images in the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom regulator under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in the image and in addition to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images when you preview the image .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the modem management ? digital stock management views any part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos is taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores this form a form of digital inventory . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos again . we look forward to downloading , ren@@ ame , convert , convert , group@@ ing , valu@@ ables , optimize , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ized , categ@@ or@@ ized , searches , transformed , conf@@ ected and exported content that hab@@ o a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is according to your definition data , which will provide information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly do not know &amp; digi@@ plug . . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantee a safe archi@@ ving that you can access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you have to do and know before you have organized something into your system . your image files must somehow be arranged on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; Please note that you need to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy about your site . if you were able to make enough photos in one year . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use the folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as re@@ version of the photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % work files will be added and you will then need to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the forkli@@ fts easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in the file format ; this is sure that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget , then you can also save the metadata from the database by selecting the appropriate point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do that &amp; digi@@ plug is available ; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you need to select any photo keywords , labels and an assessment . of course , you can choose all the images you need to add the same attribute . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s proceed with keywords , keywords , as you are often called by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ly@@ zed images from another source , then it will be digi@@ ous ; automatically insert the images to the right place . the changing of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are being done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updating while it pursu@@ es the trees .
the graphics display like different metadata . this is a very rough representation , because each blo@@ c of metadata in truth is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data have properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for your metadata .
you want to just see no one of your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to take care of your photos .
take a look at this panorama . far from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others viewing your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help you understand about the motive that moves you about what you understand .
it &apos;s ok if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , you can even use spell chec@@ ker for a selection of images simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can use your images in web galleries and then you will have to tell you the title of the web gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train leaves the spatial presentation right now with light speed .
the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your trips virtually . you can also export the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ oting the practice the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information has been found in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information requested is :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field ought to add your name , or the name of the person , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , for example , if it is not desired , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
Aut@@ os@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : links with the author . examples may be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a memor@@ and@@ um to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider &apos;s vend@@ or to identify who is not necessarily the author . if the photograph is listed here . if the picture is listed here , the picture is shown here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency is shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , though this has no protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator . this problem is for the majority of your photos only by low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future we will provide such a module for forkli@@ fts processing .
topics : record errors , record out , current , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . of course , you can claim more than a few years . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece has a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your mess@@ aging area .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about to choose the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you are only written to protect . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the remainder of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , that doesn &apos;t work miracles on CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to store the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk is able to store up to 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that was said to CDs and DVDs are also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn the data back to a well @-@ known media in a non @-@ propri@@ etor@@ ian format . if you want to check the data back to a clean , dark dry and in front of animals . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media , before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer @-@ oxid@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ fails
shortly : dis@@ cos are holding the most frequent cause of error in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of the most common error codes , SM@@ ART , can not determine the immediate im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Verlag@@ s@@ ors . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally caused without any major problems .
while most electrical equipment does not make a lot of power , this can cause heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed recept@@ ors . these can cause severe damage to hard@@ core , hard@@ wood age , hard@@ core age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against ra@@ ins is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy storage and the rest is normally absorbed . but remember that not every plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices .
because you can use over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should also consider that all peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . other manufacturers provide over@@ voltage vibration and also a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system is protected against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically start the battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow you to save your data back up to the current . if you need a UPS to keep the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compared to avoid them with power disorders at the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can you get up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive below &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only used as a solution to local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general securing solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the perspective of data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included a backup and partial storage . thus they are des@@ pot@@ able .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transfer chain on the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least ensure the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses because they generate inter@@ e@@ fer@@ encing within the data flows . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Can@@ didates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss during the notebook and 46 % in the work@@ bench systems . not@@ ebooks now amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most . it leads to a lower damage , for example theft or re@@ install@@ ers . and there is currently only very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of pre@@ ventive process during a sudden break is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 iris settings removed from fundamental physical borders . meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and spatial characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras are your limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36 mm ) or bigger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk can be managed today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t want any other data loss for data loss . your data is frequently affected by a data loss . if you want to use your data back to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the new installation of your OS , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests , you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighbor@@ ing house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of files which have been changed since last complete security . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete security and the last differential .
in@@ cre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that has been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes to a sion@@ ing system next with the exception that is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only changed the difference of files that is really changed . this happens and if you want to increase safety via ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium .
this approach lets you get enough time to discover and recover losses . at the same time you come for securing them with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for a month and a snap@@ shot should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
with this valuable pictures the next 40 year survive that is about the time span you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you need to consider and re@@ assess the time . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain watch@@ fulness . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards . less easier you can rate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ups , or change your file format , you should convert your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is always increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planning the scal@@ ability with plans and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd / / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ H ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and travel FS &amp; dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . so you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it is possible to save as much more . it is possible to save as many administrative requirements for a hetero@@ gene@@ ous coding . the dis@@ advantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression . this format would recommend you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as picture format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata . a hand@@ ful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a file information provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the shell format . but it can be able to edit metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you can think of problems with the image file . therefore , you should think of whether to use D@@ NG as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation which supports a large range of application and modeling , discussions and general work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images of copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export it into Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section add a photo to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enb@@ ank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect it to the computer , turn off the camera to the display mode , and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera @-@ interface , this can take a while using your camera . when the connection is made , a pig@@ gy indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and symbols will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to see camera information about every entry . with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information , which is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , all information is available .
the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer of slides , GPS etc. of the image . these information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . when downloading the pictures are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download them . the button selected is as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is now available to download . these images have been selected until now . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance . if you select this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you want to download the buttons all or download them , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , where normal folders will be sorted , shown in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button Del@@ ete all . if you want to delete all of them , you must first select it and delete the delete selected .
please note that there are no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the photos successfully in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera name , this should be much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not especially meaningful names . the file names are usually recovered from the camera , if you can download photos from the camera . hence , it can be useful , the date and time to integrate the picture in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ or @-@ based sub@@ directories . if you use this latter option , automatically created a folder per day .
the options During the transfer will open three more options , before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % % d % H : % S . switch on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the possibility to change the file name in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which has been digi@@ ous ; for a photo is used below the name , the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation to perform an automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras do this information . in the page section Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo is in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has information about the date where the photo was made , you can download &amp; digi@@ plug . all pictures with the same date are loaded in the same sub@@ album . not all the cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . you can read all the cameras in the same sub@@ album . in the page section Meta @-@ Data , you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you must select this option and select the option dat@@ ag@@ ave off at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is such a button to download . select File Format dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ plug is done ; you know where the pictures are loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera will be displayed . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . the identification of data can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link a image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to associate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can view a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to document the spot , or simply to document this aspect , it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ working copy of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few who works with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but you must save this data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo .
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool from Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ dat@@ ory properties that are created for map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com presents no europ@@ ean roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give you so much control over his working processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to set up the settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left .
select action can be set on sub@@ du@@ ed preview or Image Processing . thus , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ acy and copyright data . these data will be automatically written to the IP@@ TC data base when downloading . synchron@@ isation is also stored in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the author line : this field should be the job title of photographer , freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description to the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if it is a picture agency such as Reuters or Associated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency has to be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions saved the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this will enable the metadata only in the image and is not only available in the database and can not only be found in the database and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; they can be imported without lost .
image files as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures save : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you have added to your photos also by other images . attention : with images that have already been lab@@ eling , they will be over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ ous labelling .
the Options page contains all options for the information that appear when the cur@@ sor is displayed in the main window on a file . depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ plug ; to specify , you can add the file extension to this list ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ ders , which has none of these extensions , has not been removed from &amp; digi@@ plug .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the button right from each category .
the settings of the beam &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default value . each time , if you can then use the illuminated mode , you can only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have a log file , you should only get better results . if you have one , then you can get better results results .
by default , image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color you can select it here . you can switch the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dar@@ ker and light colour in the image . these colors can be switched on and off here in the image processing .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the next explanation .
with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . the only effect is reducing the image quality as P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . 1 : low and 9 a high compression ratio .
using the TIFF files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sample for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss . even if you have written the loss of loss and file size much better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata is not yet supported , but was found in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs . currently , it was developed very quickly to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are the same as the CCD sensor in sensitive to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this difference with a minimal loss of details . this option is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 bum@@ ps with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used for the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance on a white card shot in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect that exposed pictures will get more detail in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard is the top to capture the parts of your camera to capture the top of your camera as per@@ tin@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting colors creates a few unusual results since it shows the sh@@ rou@@ ters in various ro@@ kes . at last , you can try to re@@ build a few parts of the missing information from the sh@@ red@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; fix@@ w , therefore , try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . but you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing has been made . in order to keep the time for hum@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conservative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a digital image process is a digital image process to draw a complete picture from the sub@@ cut@@ ted image sensor , which have many cameras and which is a matrix of color@@ less pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available for you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . but it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lent@@ ils you can place the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ ar correction , as you are performed during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions such as these are given back . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ plug ; information like the colour information from a colour space to the other are the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Questions if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Put the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; investigated this folder during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures colour is not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be fit to the camera man and model that you are using . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some examples such as Canon , who do not have color mapping or g@@ amm@@ ac@@ or@@ cture . currently , d@@ cra@@ w gamma does not correc@@ ts conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer might be given back . this is very useful , as your printer may have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated , instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , this is not a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the finish : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ utral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing has been supported ; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . you will then select a list of available modules , and these modules are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also see some in the context menu .
Short@@ cuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the image trans@@ itions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check@@ boxes switch the metadata into or out , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad .
the camera properties are shown on the left side of a list of all @-@ time cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify the camera . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly connected . here are the port settings . currently , here are serial port , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can put the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / h , specify when you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , put it in the display mode and turn on .
test out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically re@@ alizes . if not , you can set camera am@@ o@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after your camera is set up , your camera will be camera in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera in the menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the acknowle@@ d@@ gement dialog for the shi@@ fts of &gt; images in the garbage dump you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in del@@ e@@ tion of a photos in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ eting of a album you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the changes in the right side bar without re@@ qu@@ eries . otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also download the display of the Welcome Screen Saver by &amp; digi@@ plug . under the circumstances it accelerated the start process of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ m Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start to search for new photos and has been digi@@ ous ; this extends the start time of new or deleted records ; if something has been deleted from the basic file , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks if something out of the basic file asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she asks if it is to delete it out of the database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can select from tool@@ bars under settings . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you can find more information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to preview your photos and to fix them . the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the view and selection of the entry / editing .
the Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can set up in the image processing section .
a status line at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , among them the tool@@ bar for fast access to the most commonly needed functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , the original photo will change before you save file Save or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can use the original image by rest@@ oring the image processing in the tool@@ bar . then you lose any change in which you have carried out on the photo since the last saving .
almost any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o , by clicking edit re@@ shape or restore editing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should get the short@@ cut short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to re@@ shape and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the tool@@ bar or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed and restored .
once you have started the video editing , you can choose between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu . if you want any changes to the current photo , you are asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the picture and out zo@@ oming in which you C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or use the entries in the An@@ si@@ cum menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool bar . if you do not want this , you can change it in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can call it from the digi@@ plug ; main window . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , please click the image below and receive the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and from the menu album exp@@ orting printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which is important information and promotions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation fe@@ ather , even in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple times click on the same rider to appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the label view , you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert it . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels will be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII @-@ characters and are limited to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use the button to use or change simply to the next picture , the labels will be saved .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . but you can also read the metadata into the files . this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting .
the evaluation section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the page bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate more pictures at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the pattern in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keyword and a sel@@ ective box with the previously specified in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; session lit .
the keyword will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly re@@ tren@@ ch the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set in a tree by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and choose a keyword in the keyword , this will only be applied to the whole selection , if you want to make a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter .
the page bar _ password filter is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window . if additionally , the left side bar is used with their album , - file , keywords and search results , only the cut @-@ quantity of these two files is displayed . all created files are available .
you can also drag and drop them . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply go out of the right side bar and place it . then a dialogue that you asks if you want to place the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords . they were drawn with C@@ trl + a . and after that , a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and disc@@ arded there . a dialogue asks if this keyword is supposed to be set .
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off on settings .
if you have a rule and have created and determine that it should be a or not , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the rules range .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keywords , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already in the database .
for example , you can specify an extensive search of all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , only check the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options see then as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one can use a color@@ able workflow , which allows you to easily photograph the colors of your camera or scanner . with a color@@ able workflow , you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner . you can print or publish the colors that you print from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the subject comes on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons must op@@ press for the results which he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with plenty of background information about colour management . additionally , you should make your own information about your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows are filled with six below criteria , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see further information below )
your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works as well and makes life for everyone so easy , then why one should use another color space so that you need to make thought about colour management .
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see is the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ formed region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor when I decided to work in the RGB color space only ?
yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ g@@ ert your monitor . if you are working as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you must use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . so use it before attemp@@ ting to undergo further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , devi@@ ating , automatic , and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating Automatic fix automatically try to make the best of your colors the best . they will be experiment@@ ing with these effects to see which seems best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the parameters over the whole picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible . this function is often a mag@@ ician correction for images that are dark or washed .
ab@@ by : this method adjust@@ s the brightness of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity of the intensity is as flat as possible . it is a very powerful operation , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which caused either wonders in a picture or destroyed .
automatic off : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . they determine the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the limits of the lowest and highest values on the wid@@ est possible area and a new ji@@ ffy of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white comparison of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white equivalent of a photo .
the whit@@ eboard flat correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space being removed with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original image , you can perform the whit@@ eboard in the rough mode , so your possibilities for correction can be better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equ@@ is@@ cated shape of the copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it on the menu entry colors white equ@@ alization of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and preview of the target can be seen . if you want to see the original whit@@ ens again , it will be enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the Target photos has a red mar@@ ker . this mar@@ ker &apos;s lumin@@ ance is shown as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
right top is a hist@@ ogram that is altered as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ets . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is indicated .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow of Just@@ ification is letting you enhance or down your photos .
An@@ stat with the above controls are play@@ able , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white comparison . this type also automatically set the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ loaded indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white equ@@ ator . this is shown in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and store are exactly what you set . every setting of the white comparison you can save to a text file and then re@@ load them later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button settings will return all filter values to their standard values and their neutral white background . note that neutral settings will be shown as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set the code input per color channel of the modified picture . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding needs more recording space , accounting time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found .
another important tool is available in the menu under color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mistake and always need the same correction . in the manual to the audio correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects makes you four color effects , a bicycle effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a cant@@ onal filter available .
in times of chemical processing , it was called ti@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ zer , a effect of which was developed during a partial pressure of a short flash light . this was the effect that the lighter areas coated with the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally generated , that so not to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation effect that makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a striking colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as is strongly saturated color paints but also some photographs , especially those are hardly any landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on . in large images , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be seen in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the in@@ verse problem rather than increase your satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation instead . if you like the result you can be able to preview the results using O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / contrast / Gamma the tool is based on the coating of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool has been very complicated , you need to explain the range of sliding for the range of sliding . concrete the three fir@@ ves below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity , an hist@@ ogram , of active channel or of the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three slide tables can be clicked into the inside and to change the intensity of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to move the kno@@ b and take care of it as the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated on the left .
sc@@ aling : using this drop box , if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic scale is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest tones for the middle tones , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used for example . the compression of the output can be used , for example , to create an out@@ light picture as background while doing something else in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the specified values in the file system are stored and later loaded again . the Gimp level is used .
if you are using this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , resources and sunny tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to re@@ use and click on the preview of the original program for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all the colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixels , and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see an example of the entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further .
for example , if you move a cur@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can notice that these bright tones will correspond to dar@@ ker beds and that the corresponding picture pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to look . if you want to change this mar@@ ker on the bend , the original value is displayed . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve that you have created can be saved and later loaded in the file system . the file format is the Gimp format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sunny tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ exposure inde@@ k@@ ator controls all the color channels to display over @-@ coated pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sun@@ tones has been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
using the channel display box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint like you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison of the own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ ker . when you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
checks for the module are right down : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to add these channels . if you want to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , this is especially convenient when you can also check the Mon@@ ochro@@ me option , because the channel Mixer gives you the creation of great black and white conversion of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , causes the reduction of a colour to a visible noise , which looks different from the same place in the colour channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can save and then load them . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ hand @-@ bl@@ ender format .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all the colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixels , and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure using a green lin@@ k@@ filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure using an orange line filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ gery .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie exposure using a red line filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ est@@ ates and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar am@@ mat@@ s for the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ator .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow link filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the shadow tube . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and recovery in a sep@@ ia scho@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a painting .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the bull of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame is able to add a decorative frame to be added .
the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not easy task . to keep the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ amed eye . under image frame , the module can be started using the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the image type for your picture . thoroughly re@@ loc@@ ates the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , matching with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image is bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert a simple text into a picture of any location . this is also possible in several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your properties like you need . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the digi@@ plug ; tool templates , you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image sten@@ cil apply in image processing can be used to put templates through a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . if you want to add to the size of the file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template , please send us an e @-@ mail in English to the digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ came users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to select your template folder with button Base Fol@@ der . select the folder where you have to copy the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for sten@@ cils it appears a tree view that is reflected in the folder structure of the sten@@ cil printer . the selection of folders will be updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlarges the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button shr@@ inks the lower picture . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you must cut the picture accordingly . check the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move under the template below . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; three different tools available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces very dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
Un@@ acu@@ ity mask works on the contrast of the edges to look sharp@@ ly . actually , it does not use a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it as a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Winst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements are smaller than the resolution . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private user @-@ user .
with JPEG pictures , a camera has been used for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the shell format must always be h@@ ashed in during processing .
some scanner address a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing march . you can dis@@ agree with the menu entry .
but it should be careful , as the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you can focus on the menu entry screen . in general , you can focus on the menu entry screen . below , you can find further information and comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft , is much easier than it to use . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry screen and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo .
the filter invisible mas@@ cot is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first try out . a increase in the radius or the amount should be tried first . if you produce the sharp@@ ness mask , noise and get the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius poses as many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore sharp@@ est pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the illustrated image that is added to the original . thus , the thickness of the edge is set .
the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . this way , you can define a minimum difference to the edge of the filter . this way areas can be used with a soft change between the sounds from shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ cot filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ting was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected draft @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to use a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed quot ; in which it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . you can usually start better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ting . you can start it out of the menu by calling colours re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice , the circular version works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s foot . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ oot has a very long tail , which is far from the source @-@ pix@@ ling , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ ah . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is influenced by far from the distant pixels . the causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value of 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp , but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ ce .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 but are very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is even further poll@@ uted .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this is the most common one for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you have a value un@@ equal zero , you might also need to increase cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation materials . however , if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try to execute all the labels , color and intensity cartridges on the image before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible , but later un@@ comfortable ar@@ te@@ facts left .
if you read images and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , in@@ tru@@ ded mas@@ ks produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused , the un@@ chy mas@@ c@@ ate has used a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must always produce an infin@@ ity mas@@ cot . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters it can never show the effect of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ clear color picture has to be corrected . this image has been taken with a analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of the shar@@ pen@@ ance correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the kno@@ b smooth@@ s put down the sharp@@ ness of the range dar@@ ken@@ ed to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
color content allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool designed to remove any desired arti@@ facts with an un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider &apos;s blades and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preserv@@ ation of details . a small value leads to a smooth smooth@@ ness via the image . a value of 0.0@@ 9 should be used mainly due to larger values . a value of 0.@@ 9 should not be so toler@@ ated . please note that it should always be subjected to the accuracy of correc@@ t@@ ness .
direction of correc@@ t@@ ness alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth evenly into any direction , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD h@@ iss will produce a high level of shaft similar samples . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum glass dome factor above all@@ es@@ . p then define the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore put this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is subject to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is checked , as it is difficult to value the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually it is sufficient for 1 or 2 .
angular step@@ ping distance &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angle should be a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step distance in pixels . you should avoid the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you receive by selecting this option is only minor . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to permit him .
the buttons Save as and loading are exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you draw . thus , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure .
below you can see how image errors are taken with little arti@@ facts . the module is taken on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see , there is an unusual black ar@@ te@@ facts that caused by a poor movie location during the trip . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and corrected the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides a sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel are needed and can be harvest@@ ed through the radius and color in it and thus minor bug fixes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge spac@@ ing . this value is rotating the pixel pitch . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image will need to adjust . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer get and rust@@ proof or reproach .
edges : controls the edge precision of the fil@@ tering . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter can be removed or pre@@ dat@@ ors may occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ ums if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the j@@ ure process that controls the details pane .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the j@@ ure process that controls the details pane .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which are typically stronger , however , even the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ end@@ j@@ itter@@ y absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove foam tips and is the recommended method for it .
save under and load : these buttons are used just for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how much noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected margin with ( 2 ) has been applied to the default settings .
sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution , drawing a bit soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ k with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ts and experiment@@ ing with the smooth@@ s . the fix@@ ture window on the right side of the dialog depic@@ ts the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to decrease photo fac@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches and local faul@@ ts , which is carried out along the image con@@ tours and thereby ob@@ tains the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and tex@@ turing . the algorithm is used with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ i and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Arte@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of comp@@ ress comp@@ resses and quot ; Arte@@ facts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and store are exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure .
below you can have a photo with a picture @-@ shaped r@@ ushing . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded on an Il@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film of film on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be viewed on an old paint picture , which have been viewed with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts that have been viewed by the scan light and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos that have been made with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi Project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
light , dead or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw materials photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark picture . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark picture directly in connecting to discover new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the correct dark picture to correct picture . a automatic workmanship of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and automatically re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average @-@ section : an average of the neighbor@@ ing pixels is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from the pixel block to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default movie method . all pixel with a spac@@ ing of 2 or less for pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ Pix@@ els correction on a color photo , taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ es . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ous correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. exposed corners , to correct a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can frequently be lighted up the whole sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the corners there . tel@@ e@@ ob@@ structive also show this behavior .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lens should also be used , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise in@@ def@@ ending effects are created through motion .
using large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter using a equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a pipe image that has been applied without this filter . the tool of Vig@@ net@@ ting filter is applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and add three further exposure to the target image .
dense : this parameter controls the degree of volume absorption at the point of the largest density of 1 , or randomly an optical filter with an aper@@ ture level of 1 , or randomly a lumin@@ ance of 1 , de@@ sp@@ richt@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a bigger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you need to raise your settings only .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ positioning of the target image , let the values for the lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction made on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . a cand@@ y and contra@@ diction has also been performed with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; linear dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treat the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but laughs on the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion almost elimin@@ ates .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second degree . with negative values , broad @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion is corrected and positive values are con@@ scienti@@ ously dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ ortion of the fourth degree . this value affects more strongly in the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scale the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first gra@@ ft . negative values increase the picture above .
bri@@ ghter : this is the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustration the dialog with a preview correction . the values that you are using for your image are stored and the next start@@ up is used as standard values .
the cran@@ ial or c@@ anned correction should be performed before all zu@@ d@@ - or mag@@ n@@ itude changes . at best you can cut this correction as all first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and perform a broad @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be the impact of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best fix to help you show this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , like e.g. the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the h@@ orts / c@@ ylind@@ rical dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a c@@ ylind@@ rical dist@@ ortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most pictures , the broad @-@ shaped correction made . the next logical step for some mot@@ if@@ s like recordings from front , frame and painting is to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that when you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the broad @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ ann@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . when you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film gra@@ ins and phot@@ os@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the quantity of color gra@@ ins and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ th effect applied to a land@@ scap@@ ed photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of aura in the points .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the film .
the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to view this special , gallery @-@ like , road photograph , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , in ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film bearing plate on a black / white picture applied . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed phot@@ os@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper elec@@ ts the pin @-@ size between one and five . thick brushes are better for large images . smooth@@ ness controls the smooth@@ s or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the reference is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage in drawing . it is very useful for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to capture it .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast ( smooth@@ s ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adap@@ ting the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in cells , and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ ength 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button closure .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using im@@ p effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : get the picture along st@@ ern@@ al lines going out from a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often found in sport photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ fe : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal : the picture wi@@ pes the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lenses . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion sharp@@ ness : the image wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : a car or a train photo , camera .
soft marks : the picture gets into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny colour effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shar@@ pen@@ ed sharp@@ ness : the picture wi@@ pes the image by acci@@ dental shifting of the pixels and thereby sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
smart Un@@ shar@@ per : finds the colour@@ ing in the image and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button closure .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this makes it natural your pictures a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drop . since the drop@@ let size is not taken automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size of the image . amount changes the visual effect of the drops on the image .
you can also use the digi@@ plug ; image processing has a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the choice of tools to choose the area , e.g. a face that is to stay free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the regulator . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it through ske@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers rotating and transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools designed to enlarge a photo on a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you re@@ invent a picture and get the details sharp ? how can you re @-@ invent the missing information here ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation . using a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain the aspect ratio : when enabled , when setting the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is subject to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is checked , as it is difficult to value the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading are used exactly to this . any custom@@ ization for photo may be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast on what it makes , but it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you draw . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure .
you can see an example for photo infl@@ ating , by increasing a small paint picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to use a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and remove the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
once you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus , you can change a good overview as your photo will look . you can drag the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . simply create a new rect@@ angle using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button The Add button button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the file data storing or file Save as the file to save the newly added photo .
in the thumb@@ nails , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog remains .
after a aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high format or cross format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the section format of the width is assigned .
the tool is using a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection automatically or vertical .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after a aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are stored for the next time , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the original image and not the original image .
the settings of communic@@ ating assistance allow us to add to help you to make your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ical particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ party rule , harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonious triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a split which is on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the flower sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to construct your temples and pyr@@ amids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put up your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the standing part is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmonious .
the golden middle turns liquid support lines when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results to your goal . in comparison to third party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition gives the ga@@ ze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
a further rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . it should be used to form the golden spiral . it can be a line that can be a line or different objects . this thing can be just as being without the eye , it will satisfy his task .
the Golden Tri@@ angle can be derived from the above discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diag@@ onal to this lines can be made a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame you create a effect of the professional phot@@ ographic dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious divi@@ des .
with the button color you can put the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can adjust the aid lines . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right .
for your help , the module Free Rotation is a horizontal and vertical line available . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut . choose one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing sli@@ ps the picture a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed at the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the top : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the trans@@ transformed territory .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ happy fil@@ thy holes in the corners . a possibility of dist@@ ortion it is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture to the opposite direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no turn , the image is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via transform@@ ers .
shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press on pre@@ ferences , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line finishes . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the shift , the picture gets caught a bit . for a single shift , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two deposits are generating double so much p@@ umping and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the picture , the picture has un@@ nice dirty holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all files available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats that knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the file extension is shown on the list . you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change the file extension . in the section configuration you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even select the format used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
imaging is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redundant data will be reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ less when this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour highly helpful instructions in English . you can find raw materials images in JPEG or TIFF ; you can find raw material images in JPEG or TIFF ; you can find more information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the download of raw images only with the program d@@ sc@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are produced by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are frequently stored in avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; but it is not possible to preview or edit these clips . if you click on a Movie File &amp; digi@@ plug . if you click on a Movie File &amp; digi@@ plug ; it &apos;s possible to use movies to play movies to play the program for playback .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the module White .
many tools you need to work in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft marks , cra@@ cking supp@@ ress , re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing , del@@ eting the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this gradu@@ al bal@@ ks shows the status of the filter to the current image . links of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected pre @-@ looking area .
split horizont@@ ally without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and bottom shows the filter to the range below the selected pre @-@ looking area .
divide vertically . the left area displays the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
the upper area displays the original and the lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ land and exposure . the used colours can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the image and you can see on the part of the picture , which you want to preview the preview part of the dialog box will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all adjustment of the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar properties shows the essential information about the selected picture and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the mar@@ ble miniature range . you can push it through the mouse button . push it through the left mouse button . push it through the left mouse button . push all images in this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is , of course , containing your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and use colors .
the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or search the folders by files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes any other ; depending on whether this mode is checked , you can choose the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection which has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for each color of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line sign , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as one color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit .
colors in a p@@ allet and color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE @-@ program for viewing &amp; graphic programs . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in the science , particularly in the software . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; it has been used for displaying the program author passed &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of an integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ ers . graph graphics with all the possibilities of an integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change in the graph and Kate ; the graph is calculated and in &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; open the graph in &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; open in one &amp; Kate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graphic tool ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph . in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . in this case , the tool bar is open only as in the lower screen picture . in this case , the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list is last open files . click on the first icon to open the file format .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen picture :
as you can see , an overview in the corner will be shown if graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position in the context menu or select this location automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; the uploaded file has changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . you can also change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings .
if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , eg . in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; or you want to open a new &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; the instance would like to exhibit a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can be changed using the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be split up to multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph may be applied on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the page may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page once again gives the ability to specify the behavior if a file is changed on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page open gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphics . you can specify a standard behaviour for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the page seating status gives the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine when they are asked to be asked .
the context menu , usually at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n . appears , further options are opened :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms choose . entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard used graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of straight lines . the algorithm calcul@@ ates the edges into the same direction ( from above or left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for odd graphics . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring@@ time model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i @-@ Algorith@@ m is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statist@@ ic multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm created for odd graphics a spring@@ time model layout . it uses the so@@ ber @-@ clean gold He@@ ur@@ ination , and includes a multi@@ player to treat large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .

the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of an image . the ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographic in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system that is used by GPS and Galileo to locate . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . to upload a cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you must download a file file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that have been recorded in the same time at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded with a automatic cor@@ relation which displays the coordinates into red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ ts are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera version must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera capability . the devi@@ ation below will be merged . the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file , and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality , you can set a loc@@ ation in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits and then press the button .
the coordinates can be manually set using this dialog . since the dialog you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog you &apos;ll need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found and placed on the displayed map and make sure you have reached this area , until you have reached an ample accuracy . the map can always be manually chosen . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed manually .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are options to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums created as HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings . you need to select them all the albums you want to select . with the three buttons on your right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you will see a large number of albums .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . if you click on a picture , a new page is displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default view , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally also the file size . all other settings are explained .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user as far as the action . press ab@@ rupt in breaking the process .
when the module has generated sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore restart the program to see if error occurred during generation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press the module to close the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to watch a selection of images and run on them basic operations like rotary , zo@@ oming or shi@@ fts . the viewer can be used with short commands and cou@@ plings . it was designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without imp@@ acting your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to store images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is the file size , since no compression of the colour information is taking place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format again .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera system is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ oral . attention : the participants of this list speak English .

with the Import feature of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image file dialog with which you want to copy the image file , so the image will copy to which you want to copy the metadata . if you want to copy the data , click the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an image file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD to your DVD Player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG slides . then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files . there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should be able to adjust the other settings . if you are planning to re @-@ publish the file on a TV , you must set the corresponding TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under name of the m@@ peg file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file , if you have an audio file , it will be integrated into the film . depending on your computer you can start the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the dip when you return .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right down button .
the printer driver allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined image can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is , for example , to enhance or print the Gimp module for the direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ sc@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ sc@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera producer . sometimes you get a cra@@ p better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window will then appear in mode for a single picture . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now dup@@ licate the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amp@@ lifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera does not work in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a fun@@ ni@@ ated algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you are preferred to edit your pictures or later to use otherwise , you should not select the JPEG format , as it is only a limited number of operations . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that are stored in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stack processor mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . so use this mode if you are sure , for example , by testing on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have here the possibility to automatically over@@ write it . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier trial . however , a preview is not available at how far the conversion progress is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and time@@ stamp of the time@@ stamp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . in addition , four kinds of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ in . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image format .
proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . aspect ratio will be changed at this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo series . the target image , including background size , border size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the images in advance . more pictures can be drawn from the list of images to be drawn .
after you started the module , the pictures window with the images are displayed in selected images . to add more images , you can add more images to a file selection dialog . for the last image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag pictures onto the picture list and add it to the list of images to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images are removed from the list of images to be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached already as App@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the coming e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a set @-@ up file , the comments are joined to a text file and enclosed by mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format are added , then the original ex@@ if@@ ications will be added to the displayed images .
when the process is completed , the window will not be shut down automatically to view the status messages , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . using the button , you can shut this window ? EN .
after starting the Mod@@ uls Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation uses very elegant image trans@@ itions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the file names indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation in an end loop is displayed . you can then manually set it with Es@@ c .
the option images can be randomly chosen to indicate that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album .
delay between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , choose another effect in every transition .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides .
on the left of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ oral . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module requires the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in this browse , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in each group , in people , places and in group keyword items are available .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have typ@@ ed your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view on your hard disk and watch the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each page is described .
if you press with the mouse to the entry number , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this method you can re@@ tren@@ ch the number of pictures shown by a few thousand images .
if you select all people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your photo area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . they can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . however , for each person sharing your own image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see this picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures ) .
however , you must choose which image for each individual person is to be displayed . to do this , you will need to select the picture @-@ An@@ si@@ cum windows ( in a closer look ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the An@@ si@@ ft window , you can adapt the image to your wishes and select which part of the picture will be displayed and cut .
if you are looking for searching in the main window , a dialog will be displayed , which is very similar to the picture of the picture properties . this dialogue can be seen on the picture once again .
if you enter a string of writing into the field or description , the labels and descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you like , you can also use a part of the total date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album . if you do not want to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the web@@ page of &amp; Photo@@ Album ; and check out the quick@@ est , screen photos and quotes .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and start the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry into photo@@ album . -@@ demo . next , some example pictures are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ album . try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this body you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each body then shows a different unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( when you see a date , the first picture will be displayed in preview screen ) and in addition , the time bar will always display the current date displayed if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and click the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data is displayed . if you select a range , you will be able to cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the time bar .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; presents two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the following part of the user manual is integrated in &amp; photo@@ album . in the following part of the user manual the text is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in the following part of the user manual page , which you can use the HTML file ... .
before HTML pages you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the over@@ look and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether you want a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export File is to be created on the review page . place more information on export files you &apos;ll find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page . for example , you can find that information is displayed by a party . for example , you can &apos;t use that photos from a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain views .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why not specifically made .
below the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . this way , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor , which supports maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no pictures to download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . it can thus browse your pictures with low resolution , search for a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture greater , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting , set the various folders and URL where your website is stored .
best for all your HTML files , select a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and the next time will be added to the location . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you &apos;re looking for the Base Fol@@ der . if you specify a web browser after the Base File is created , the URL , which you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them manually . this is why you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folders in which all sub@@ folders exist .
the installation options have all three on basic folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are looking forward to a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ albums , you may want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures . if you have already checked your pictures , persons on the pictures , capture site , etc . , you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not yet to be done .
with &amp; Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the properties are ex@@ - und imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images can be stored in the file , or if you can all have a link to the file in the file that you can share all images and keep this file so independently . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in the file the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file , the images will be displayed if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is described in the following dialog for exp@@ orting images , which you can export on the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automatic option , copy the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; photo@@ album . download the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small , it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this nevertheless , simply select the Export Export option .
the last option of this page is maximum limit . if you would send images to your friends , because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , for example , to say that each image should be maximum 800 pixel high and broad .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select what images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you are the category of person@@ able file person@@ es ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file and which categories these categories correspond in your database .
in the fourth step , you can assign the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is on the picture .
it must be easy to browse and watch images : if you look at pictures you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) to search and look through ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been released as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book it is spoken about images , but frequently this also includes videos .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want to secure it .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are saved and use this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read a different folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of user manual you will discuss the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols , which you can call on the viewing options and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
on view the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle @-@ member states .
you can see the custom@@ ization options available for you to determine the member groups . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want . in the left side of the window , you can see a list with the current category and in the right one of the sub@@ categories .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; shares his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . additional information on this page can be found on the Ki@@ pi &apos;s homepage .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can &apos;t be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ albums , but most modules have a help page , which you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with each other , it can be that the modules have been tested with the demo database before using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo@@ albums are not working . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ albums , and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
I sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so show all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album , as follows :
when &amp; Photo@@ Album ; S Browser plays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you would like to use the category for example , if you would have chosen persons to view and add this module to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ albums are not compatible . you can also remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules that modules are loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window . at the tool@@ bar you can see the window , with which you can view your image database . in the section , we will not view images on this window , but now click on the pictures below , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ albums ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , where the image has been taken on the picture , where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of pictures . if you are depicted on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all images taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brows@@ ing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , see three lists with a text box by selecting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album . as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the move of the pictures inside the list : if you are depicted for example a family celebration and on all 50 frames the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find out that the used names are post@@ pon@@ ed to locate the persons faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to view a alpha@@ be@@ tically sorted list , click the symbol for sort by date under the list .
if you have been selected individually for each image , you may need to edit all the selected images , and click on these images with notes . in this case , click on the above and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be comfortable to mark all these images and add multiple entries to one note with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as a group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in context menu of the An@@ des dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ category or Sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category . attention , this ass@@ umes you can sort out your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dial@@ ogs by clicking the edge of the frame , click and move it out . you can also make your own window by clicking it outside the window range . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , please click on the button options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and the look of the window .
you can also complete a frame completely . if you want to view this window later again , use the button options ... and here window a / aus@@ ing . this procedure you can see in the picture .
if you select the pictures show in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the current selected images , or all the images you have no filter . here you can see the size of thumb@@ nails by simple to bottom pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be established as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display is created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete , or select the Edit button , or select the Edit menu . now the window will be shown you can see in the picture .
&amp; Photo@@ Album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere you have stored on your hard disk . in the picture , you &apos;ll have to download the pictures somewhere else . in the picture , you &apos;ll see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be downloaded .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on your hard disk . for example , the pictures are available in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can view this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and want to copy them again . if you want to avoid trouble acting on your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can also check out the pictures you want to see in the menu . alternatively , you can also view all the images you want to see and select the menu item everything except current view .
this way , you have set out what images will be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry screen , making all the pictures you have blocked off . if you want to see the images again , click lock up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must unlock the images to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please remember that this image protection is by no means very secure . you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and to the others , the password as un@@ encrypted text can only be read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , with those that are not familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with views of private pictures .
the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ albums ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point . for this reason , you can see them at some point . for this reason , you can see them out of the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . obviously , this picture shows you the picture , but additional information you can enter on the image , like e.g. who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top part of the picture you want to see it , so you can also configure what information displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , matching entries on this display . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can use the buttons to the top and down the picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the be@@ holder , you can run it as a slide show . as often it can run a new image after a few seconds . as frequently it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus down . then the slide show is broken by the keys C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful feature of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ album . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can get in the picture in and out . using the mouse button , you can easily zoom out into the picture . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so the image is not drawn drawn , so that every pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ mer@@ ations work at videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the context menu from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you can look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgot to put in on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to view this name . but you &apos;ll be able to mark the picture and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while being one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you are looking at . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures are available in your browser . if you have all the pictures you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and characteristics can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you can view categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view View , then you can simply press the characters for the trait after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you are allowed to paint your photo@@ album .
this is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your cash later .
in the picture , you can see a picture painted on the painting by &amp; photo@@ album . in order to exit the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to work out the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ ruled , but the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already chosen object , as all sub@@ objects have already been selected with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object , or select either in the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following fol@@ dable menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under editing or from the menu button .
if you have changed properties , click on users to apply these changes . if you have invalid values , a message will be displayed with a error description , then click on users or reject the changes .
when you enter the Path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in your own view .
press preview in your own view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , if you want to select a texture display ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the location for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the window .
each object has a visual stage as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar chosen level of the scene .
&amp; K@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are left and the four graphical views are displayed on the right .
if you do not like the default window order or if you need any other arrangement , you can also save them as desired . you can also save multiple window orders and easily change between different arrangements .
to anchor a window via or under one side view , drag the start to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to right or left side of a view . the new view is ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you wish to arrange several views over one another , drag the beginning to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map leaders in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to view a view out of the anch@@ oring , drag the start to the top left to the left pointing left arrow in the beginner bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the beginner bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are slo@@ ping , you can anchor them to any point .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window rules under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene .
a R@@ ender mode comp@@ lies with entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of re@@ ig@@ ning modes , from a quick preview of up to whole pictures .
if you click on the icon The RE@@ N@@ DER settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog :
any R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you want to use only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and specify the image section to the ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in combination of quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this is a very simple colour and light model to create a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a painting with only a ray is rendered , different mistakes can be created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or pattern effects in curves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this property are better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ itary recur@@ sively , because every pixel is still divided and adap@@ tive because the record speed depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray runs a ray of pixel . if the difference between each color indicates the given threshold of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the parameter value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r . 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference is divided between the indicated threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which can be checked individually and on further sub@@ division , you can adjust the maximum depth of records .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is reducing the creation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card map , you can set if the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly finished , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import , select the file entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command @-@ sum@@ s of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from object @-@ tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . to import objects to the scene , simply select the code text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
model and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is called P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the self @-@ release view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . please click here the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elev@@ ation data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter the files in the folder , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for viewing in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
you can adjust the points of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling , and rotating .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better humidity for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross High detail not@@ ices for advanced projec@@ tions , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera is using an advanced projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this property results in a better approach to the projec@@ tions , but more time to ren@@ dering .
when you view a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you view the ground , the ground is rendered below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the edge of the edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise data to parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in section window orders will be explained as you can create and save window orders .
the combination of standard window order : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can add and delete selected images with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with boxes , you will receive a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and firmly ancho@@ red the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now , you would like to start with no more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can create the ultimate but easy scene , among beginners : a ball on a plain .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you are aware that you can only use a black screen as a result . if you want to use a 3D program , you should note this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have all faul@@ ts installed , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; following pre@@ set window order :
take a little time to meet the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you produce . in particular , the view from the camera &apos;s fourth wire model view ( right below ) is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera has to change in view control points , with which you can change the camera point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired point .
if you press the button or add the input button , the wireless model views and the object tree are changing immediately with these settings . as a result , they look at the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might need to insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion end@@ ent body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a thorough method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane than the floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button of user or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the level , even though at the moment , only as a limited time . when you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you &apos;re looking at the object tree , you will find that you can click on the icon + above the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to meet some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
first , select the bottom to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit .
in both cases , a dialog appears where you can select how the object is being inserted . please select the name in your own view@@ point ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only displays a matt black material , because you can still enter the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . now there are many ways to preview the pig@@ ments . but there are many possibilities now , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you look no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button of users and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is set right now . if you ren@@ dering your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colour . you &apos;ll need to enter two new attributes . in the colour list , you must select two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colours ) :
in the object tree each time , choose the colors in the object properties tab :
you should already simply execute this step because you have already understood the basic working methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it can already be understood as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . place the value for the radius : in 1 ( do not forget the input button or to press the button . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have shifted the bottom to a unit down .
of course , the Ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . use the following step to find a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as colour :
choose the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . then click on the pig@@ ments , then select insert and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the user button .
the settings gloss effect and reflection produces some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you &apos;ve already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a re@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ dering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel are reflected and the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect . so , the scene pixels are mach@@ ined for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with whom you see the scene . without a light source you can see the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously generated with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and memory .
marks the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last data .
this menu entry allows you to only select if you have not stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ t command . you can only select this menu if you have using Edit menu .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog for the device of tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ fix rough surfaces without changing any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour on pixel base , by using an image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image , or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or press return .
you can set if each picture is to be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures will always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the right lower corner . then a small input field is highlighted in the lower right corner . when a pass@@ ender fil@@ en@@ ame is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialogue -@@ &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can set on below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is enabled , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still view the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when opening the last open folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored beams to select a background color . when in window mode , this window is larger than the image is larger than the image , also the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option will magni@@ fy the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
specify if the slideshow can start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is broken off by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
modify the button for the different modes of modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the map maps short commands for the display window .
with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
reduced the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display panel for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the picture in original size . this is only meaningful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photographic work based on the digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to watch and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and potential improvements .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; please ask here questions to other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to take up &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mailing list . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his working processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up the settings in eight pages . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure inde@@ ators , you can select the color that is shown if the sub@@ - or over@@ loaded indi@@ k@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colours with what you should display , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure should display a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find this page in the image processing . you can view this page in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a application for sc@@ anned images that do not make more than images and en@@ rich them .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scan of images that do not make more images than images and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the san@@ e project site by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ em@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break off &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; stop .
further att@@ itudes contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat these options .
in order to add a picture , the user can start a preview can start and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can start through the preview button .
to select the picture better , the user can zoom in the image and out of the current selection out . it can also set the zoom as well that the complete preview can fit in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , the picture will be shown in a preview window as shown below , then the picture is stored and lie ? EN leads to a departure and you will go back to the main window .
the button settings will open the same named dialog in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can look at the picture , if desired , preview before saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview can be selected . if this preview is not desired , the option must be selected .
this attitude allows them to select the way and select images . dialog for storing each picture opens the dialog in front of any c@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite opens the dialog in a previously defined folder , you will need to save Save without after a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without after a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder will be saved as standard for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatic images and is also the proposed name for the picture in the dialog for Save . the automatically stored image will be numbered when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt to the saving image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . when Cho@@ ose the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . button About starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings will show the dialog for Settings and Close can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key cuts . below you can set up a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and your function . the global button symbol can click on the player window and select the key button . click with the right mouse button in the player window and select Short@@ cuts ... select .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts function . thus , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function may be &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok support the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of dependence . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use the user dialog , so the user does not know why a script does not run .
start on the &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as basis for your own scripts or simply to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing by scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and manage Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scripts are able to execute external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send not@@ if@@ ications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . if a script does not need to take care of each script . if a script is rest@@ art@@ ed , Amar@@ ok put the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; using D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the batch length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le Con@@ tains the Path to the selected files of playlist . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le can also be used to remove an entry . to remove a record again , one can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script Mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be un@@ compressed using the user &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can be optionally also compatible with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that allows users to detect the archive clearly as am@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 is only accept script packages with the expan@@ sive amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
when your script package is complete , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang up the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has lots of useful and powerful features , but is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to get through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands of thou@@ sand@@ ing in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and the Quick Search , you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so you can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , one must enter the main folder of the Amar@@ ok @-@ Sour@@ ces to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok , in order to comp@@ ile and install :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no difficulties in comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options to enable or disable the compilation time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
certain depen@@ dencies must be met for some of the comp@@ iling options so that they can be used . for details , please refer to the system requirements .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window will display a player window in addition to playlist , or off . if the option is off , only play@@ lists windows are shown .
use the Stim@@ ulus bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok . compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the pac@@ ket bar@@ ometer .
tuning : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the used color scheme is altered for stimul@@ ating bar@@ ometer .
query files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the memory location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser needs to be launched by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when a browser is required .
other brows@@ ers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; playlist when saving , stores the current playlist automatically by selecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting is &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
the piece can be seen when the play change is visible , that the play@@ lists windows open / off , in order to keep the running piece always in the visible window .
when changing the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance you can custom@@ ize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
in font @-@ section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , Player windows and Con@@ text browser . press on select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the custom @-@ defined color scheme you have the source of choice and can define your own color scheme . use it among them activated color selection for front and background color .
playback at the start will continue that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after programming the play automatically starts with the piece on the site , with which it has been stopped at the last end .
to set up on @-@ screen display , it enables you to display on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is to select the font . to select from the dialog you select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow will be shown that the text in the O@@ SD is shaded .
you can use your own colors to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the colour areas opens the dialog for colour sel@@ ections . if own colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ ites are used ; colors are used .
the input field display text represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by adding plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of the available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama user . so you can set on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD screen .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down sel@@ ector . some drivers require further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card collection will be used for setup all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check@@ boxes for inser@@ ting as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folders : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder search for music as well .
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , create a incre@@ mental search to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the section database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup is needed in the MySQL facility .
the MySQL server section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under machine : it is used to enter the MySQL database . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database name is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to insert data that are required for the connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names from played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
here you enter your User@@ name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send ch@@ un@@ ed pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting is &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters for each piece can be played . note : you can &apos;t load the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained in it ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD will keep in advance that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will also function difficulty . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see this error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and see also the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the file again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Infos out of this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used to comp@@ ile libraries with the same comp@@ iler version , e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x then leads to de@@ bug@@ ging the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a commonly occurring crash , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; Die file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script uses the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl @-@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix it in the control centre under image symbols . note that in some cases , you can click on an icon in some cases until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ an error : amar@@ ital app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found using ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this mistake , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Amar@@ ok will first find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems get the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net at Channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear there only one error if you have something on the up@@ lift of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do music play there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist , and select column displays . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the evaluation for one piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall into it , just as you would make it with other files . it &apos;s that simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) and you will find it about the menu bar under the ex@@ tras ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent base , therefore , the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . like you , we can even support text and P@@ NG !
it can ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 Decoder can be supplied as default ( from patent legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de ,
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ sa link driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be used to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender can be achieved using a sound card ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software Mixer ) . watch the help mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sc@@ ink ( e.g. fossil ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded at first . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable the sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

either do not use the Arts Dri@@ vers , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was greatly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller buffer . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , falls &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . perform G@@ ST @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if it doesn &apos;t help you can also ask your IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before@@ hand before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg before , comp@@ ile and install it . then execute the module folders with G@@ ST @-@ config ( g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please tell about it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ oral . if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to read the current one in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on a different computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . Dies@@ bar command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current piece from : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name - Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this ass@@ umes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size of changeable window .

basically , this matches the previous rating with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result .
you can add the review to a piece by yourself , by clicking on the right mouse button on a column in the play@@ lists . there you can click the review by using the right mouse button on the piece click and edit : add or F2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want to inform you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok that some users can find quite annoying also . disable the option symbol when playing in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the changes to you .
download a design , or create your own . install this one under Amar@@ ok .. image context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of ab@@ rup@@ ts and thus also a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok was compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine this output modules does not comp@@ ile . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution , which install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine dev@@ el . after that , you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ comp@@ ile and install again .
I &apos;m getting the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with Pre@@ lin@@ king , that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ lin@@ king . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ TC : uses no LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message present to handle the file &apos; mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

you will receive the error there is no element present to handle the stream audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administ@@ er G@@ ST @-@ register . then start Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output give you the device . typical for example HW : 0 for standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual mix tool , de@@ activate the tick at sound card m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not going to be taken care of . you may not hesitate to take this problem by yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so urgent need for Arts : )

mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a well @-@ developed MP3 Decoder can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn it to a audio CD . de@@ co
So@@ x : an aux@@ iliary program which can convert between different audio formats and can convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ lean : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 files ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect , which the music pieces can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folders of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the file created before , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what happened . you can then ab@@ rupt the Save and Chan@@ ges . in addition , you can shut it off and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; ask for any stored project , what to happen to it , as if you would have called for every project file shut .
closes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project , what should happen to happen if you would have called File Close .
if you are calling this entry , you can select the following dialog files to add the project . if the current project is on the project , the current project is a data CD , the so added files are added in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the Project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is that ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for multi @-@ session CD . this is always useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you more than help , so that you can already see the files and folders on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD @-@ Project . this feature lets you remove files from the current project . all other files do not remove files from the medium . this function blocks no files from the medium , they only end the imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . alternatively , you can also make copying a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also burn a picture from a CD instead of normal head . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs using defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . alternatively , you can also use a DVD to copy DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW disk . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog for the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you the choice between writing modes and incre@@ ment@@ ally .
if a CD burning is a CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which can be burned immediately through pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so , you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso -@@ file as data source , which can be burned immediately through pressing the burning button .
a previously @-@ read DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window is commonly used after reading a DVD in the sy@@ no@@ ce , but can also be used properly . it contains information about the read video , code settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information on the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and contain properties of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when one entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the lower edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
if the folder view switches or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives , if the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the wheel or disc@@ ard the media .
switches the sy@@ no@@ view or out . the contents view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a disk has been selected in the folder view .
switches the head@@ line in the project view or the head line is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens up a dialog for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key assign@@ ments to the bottom .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system administ@@ rators are required to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will open . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work properly . this dialog is intended to person@@ alise and intended to adjust the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with an &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so it is more important to your taste and the type of your task is crucial that the bit@@ rate can be given .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the command line d@@ co@@ p , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b has started . then enter something like this at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void custom@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void f@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void th@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void th@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX X@@ Project method , one can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ o@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b / 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface , which applies only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ urn ( K@@ URL : : list URLs , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ volume ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT for Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / un@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are currently supported ( los@@ ers are still installed from the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , read the &amp; CD title ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per tracks ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is compiled . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other coding are already available , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile it yourself . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , it is not necessary to install its installation .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to read any copy protection . if not , it is possible to avoid copying the audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid copying the copying system . simply avoid the copying of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup dialog has to be made only once ( the setup dialog may be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , after the daily use of a &amp; CD . this leads to your understanding for the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , where everything is covered manually .
this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example , you can find more information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration .
the CD@@ DB is launching the CD data according to the installation of the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be produced . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Schematic Editor tab setting - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available encoder so that the selection can be read from another encoder as the default . it is to be noted that previously the encoder is configured in the settings dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already booked file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
open the setup dialog for the type of not@@ if@@ ications ( as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as Encoder , for setting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choosing the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can re@@ play these files .
under the audio formats , you can lose information through data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above all bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both co @-@ quality produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions .
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper Bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a calcul@@ ator or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is available .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi@@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi@@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi@@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR together stereo , compression rate approximately 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided manually or by the program automatically added to the internet as a list of parameters . they can pass / used in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome , and the code name and the properties of the music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ software there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or help to Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switch for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( english : day ) when MP3@@ s can be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself to the computer . it is to note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note that the author is meant ) I &apos;m not attorney . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so it can not be added to the artist nor the music business . all information can be used anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; it is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome , it is intended to use ge@@ ographic on the next round mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and re@@ sembles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read @-@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that it wants to know that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , searching in the source code .... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first when this is not done yet .
to store the cast WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening , you can submit pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Co@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined coding . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer are in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information on its switches can be obtained via the command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the equipment of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to indicate both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could be a note on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
if you have read the complete manual , everything is understood but somehow not to do something ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will set up the program for the first time , and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can do of course .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd exists and that you have write scre@@ ams on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome , something which is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; which needs to be repeated for each additional &amp; CD .
here we determine how to use the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program to use the free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; to download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any read &amp; CD , if the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading programme to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , it can also help with the file / etc / f@@ scale and an attempt to insert the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card map of General Settings . here there is no much to do . here , an additional transformation is defined . in our example , everything is shown as loaded as shown in the screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you are informed if data are missing ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the free@@ DB server on the free@@ DB server .
the second drop is simple , becomes a &amp; CD ; entries found immediately when you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting folder name / file name or tag entries , they can easily be changed using Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; file name and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , select the select fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is more than 620 MB big , you can select this twice if you want to use the database , at least the first select fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is located on the following map series .
CD@@ DB is free@@ way for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know what data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . place it as shown on the screen picture .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this road , the load between the hosts will be distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls will bo@@ ve the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the free@@ DB server . the first check box should be activated .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously read pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it just try yourself .
CD ; to read out the last piece : check this around &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this box , then / must the Path / Fol@@ der is stored . this cannot be useful if only place on another drive . if the box is not built on another drive , don &apos;t forget to use this folder when you want to do something with WAV files .
everything so enter as it is on the screen photo . the command is slightly long , under circumstances something has to be seen on the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP3@@ s . as previously mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restri@@ ction of generation tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted , in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously active WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
in this section , describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we &apos;ll be able to set up a link to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is to be set up . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each additional &amp; CD .
since we are a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB will see the screen photos slightly different from the data . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD , instead of taking them out of the Internet . comments will be shown on the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; it could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then find questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully collected from the free@@ DB , all titles of the tracks are already filled and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case , that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; specifies a window , and you can select the database entry , which fits best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually rede@@ em it by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you need access to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen picture , enter the title of the piece in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ ally per unit , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful demand of data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the comment , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have an unlimited number of field settings . this option is located on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ en@@ Settings tab . take a look at the tab card settings .
you can change the tag information of the produced files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it , you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see in the help to get more information to get more information .
just select an entry , obviously , with the style of the exit CD ; this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data . simply enter the entries for the first piece . enter the title of the table in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typ@@ ed all the titles of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of database .
it is the third kno@@ b of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list box .
note that there is a check sign in front of each line of one piece . only the titles which are marked so labeled . make sure that all pieces are selected , or be sure to select the button All pieces on the lower edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the read process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click the tab on the tab for switching on the box window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly beneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the job . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message is when you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list are marked .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the ending of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece from , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to sub@@ divide this behavior . the machine is un@@ clear to read and code the number of parallel processes . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and code ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a little window will be blind@@ ed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; is today within the &amp; k@@ de ; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ drome ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at persons , comp@@ ile by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is correct to you :
a program that calls many different programs to call , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step for the options and settings . it shows photos of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the Help menu has been clicked on , without any reference point as it should go on from that somehow empty screen ( above all , if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads it , probably has started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author does not want to add or change this manual . at least it &apos;s the first version for a manual or change it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ ous@@ er from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some properties of real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ authentic@@ ation of lyrics , also some features that do not have other &amp; UNIX .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS @-@ and &amp; k@@ de ; support also on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projector , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the text on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window may move to checkout .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ alls or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically identi@@ fies the procedures used .
seat support . if you want &amp; k@@ de ; stop playing a song , K@@ Mid will start again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose Open ... from the menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ gam@@ ble from the menu piece or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive on the kno@@ b and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display and so the speed can change . to restore the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry in the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts playback . place the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , other use lyrics , and other both . some tracks have no text : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , so you will automatically be able to adjust the record automatic text . if you still have the option to change it manually . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case you wish to set an event type , select Settings menu settings of the entries or property events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are played by row after . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open first collection manager . find this in the menu collection under the point organizing .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the immersion in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song in the collection manager . again , you can select the file dialog with which help you choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when used ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic adding to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to select the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click to remove .
you can select the sequence in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu image sequence , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you add or delete songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list on the Karaoke text .
to jump on a song , select the Next song next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to skip a song back , select the button pre@@ defined piece , the entry pre@@ defined piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the Collec@@ tive collection there , and click on the button del@@ e@@ tion .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map which converts all events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to tr@@ ump and thus always be a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must edit the corresponding file ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for this , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; An additional Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you can see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that one section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can be in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is shown . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave the order for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional x@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can capture a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , you can use the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if you want to play a MIDI file a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch meant that each tone is a different percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . thus , you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keyboards for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel . look at the enclosed Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to exchange some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and second channel , you simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain canal ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , set up following the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will be defined further forward in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this canal . in this case always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the Per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is given in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event will be multiplied with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to have no dec@@ imal notation in the map file ) .
this setting is needed because GM suggested that GM is to play a sound higher with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to play some keyboards up to an oct@@ ave higher . unfortunately , try to find some keyboards up to an oct@@ ave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this manual you can see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to indicate the played tones . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed where a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the speed of a song . if you find it for example , a song is too fast to change the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; which has been compiled because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you have to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable you to add automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to temporary collection .
you can push the arrow keys left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to double the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just change into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file only , without adding it to a collection , turn off the Automatic Add @-@ Collection and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only you want to play the first file . so you set the setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then join , also include B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me to program further on &amp; k@@ mid ; program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ill ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hobbies , but I try to make a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies , I &apos;m trying to collect MIDI files , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , send me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you &apos;re really making me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me if you want to contact me , as I already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money from nobody . I &apos;d like to re@@ use it because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you have a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends entirely on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error messages directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playing DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the website The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will be displayed only if information is in the window .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred links under the menu option , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category Dur@@ able playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ stage . if you buy an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and long @-@ time play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only select the files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , as well as the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part .
after modi@@ fying XML files , you have to be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at starting and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at starting does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate it by opening another source . however , this would be a second time at the end of the animation . the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suits ; &amp; gt ; / body@@ suits ; in the directory contains some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this rend@@ itions in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ amp@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the play@@ field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be used , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to search in a consoles and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual alter@@ ations of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play cards from TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , you need to be used to use the device and TV channels . it can be edited manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is able to use dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be detected by selecting a encoding ( for example , it &apos;s PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video can also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one function ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be working for the X server . therefore , the XFree86 server needs to be included in the configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , by K@@ M@@ Player , the sources are used for different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this feature is the dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
are there indications like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I am playing from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after joining the device . absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom has to display on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will examine the CPU .

&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment available for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical surface and inside this one simple , comp@@ ile and custom@@ iz@@ able access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in addition , the easy to use wiz@@ ard and conversion tools for this . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn his ways the manual was to be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right way to use : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . to use the original &amp; tex ; it can also use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; it can also be a less demanding but more realistic fatigue , that it &apos;s from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here is only a good review to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here it is not the ultimate book . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. DA@@ LY , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other recording languages , lat@@ ex includes and lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , sides and text can be specified as well as a princess with the command \ \ &apos; document@@ aries { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an open function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some mapping to the document . it can also be made to the document @-@ related settings .
document categories : this is how the kind of document must be arranged : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , review ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; reference &#93; , fo@@ amer &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : hereby the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for the correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they can only be washed in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN standards ) .
new users can now don &apos;t worry . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers - just like other source code editors , the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is likely to be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , they will be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
with the automatic placement of the environments is generated by &amp; k@@ ile for input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Trans@@ action } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically set up an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; design the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ section element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on each side .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful if a DVI @-@ file is created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as font type &amp; tex ; or lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print out of DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the door search , the elements of the DVI ; file is clicked on an element in the DVI ; file code is checked , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . as soon as on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was clicked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ ulated .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ based master document project project settings can be adjusted .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no errors are available in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode , the DVI ; file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ in@@ gen@@ â , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; according to the fast structure .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar the three gro@@ ove should be found in the document . the first drop down is designed for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ tible &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field further features items such as keywords , joints , notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a section for a section , image , or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection over a selection box ) .
using quot@@ ation is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for editing &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are relevant editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ s is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the fox notes , etc . there are the following correspondence :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and set of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; document@@ aries contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font has been fixed , it can also occur in the text .
once the above source code has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; lat@@ ex needs to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu building or of the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the data automatically .
once the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought after the errors . if using fast construction and ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce , it should be automatically launched . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an area ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the rest document . for example , a report with the font should be given a different font . the command \ \ Du@@ ge { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end are to be a different font } .
the changes are only super@@ vised within the area ( from \ \ &apos; to { environment } up to \ \ end ( environment ) . there is no need of sign@@ age ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
there are many options for the reading of read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , passive pressure , under@@ line , etc . , they will end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Hour Just emp@@ h } : this command is for the short print and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { h@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ &apos; start { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language is shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard was typ@@ ed a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better reading of the document should be completed . at least a quote , a few places in fatty and short print and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer must be closed .
once the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a series of internal file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ l ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen TVs .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps will be shown as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI you can print the document using File Print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar bl@@ ends the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin to convert other formats by means of the most popular PF@@ E in the tool@@ bar .
to search , search the direct jump from the editor to da@@ isy @-@ up position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; installation files . only modern under settings must be set up ... Tools building a building .
to increase the incident , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and connect to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the central mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; it needs &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; it needs to set up &amp; k@@ ile ; as text editor ... editor )
if using quick@@ ening of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be desired , an error can be found . if a bug is fixed , this will be displayed in the log file format or in the news window .
the log file extension refers to the error source in the source code . in the editor you can always check the error in which the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error must be clicked on and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error in the protocol .
once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the pre@@ set values are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be re@@ written either by reason or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
h@@ ort users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file . create a new template using an existing document and a selection of file template . create ...
when creating a new document from a template , a few strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which character strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in Document Class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; document@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , then the own template can be generated rather than the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created in an easy way to create a template , and should be searched by one in the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for many types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile in the menus .
to learn more about Kate and Kate and his maj@@ esty should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called upon the menu of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . they contained a detailed description of all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use it as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click button to complete the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ My ) .
when pulling the text with dr@@ unken left mouse button , the washed text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated Shift can be washed parts of the source pane in the Edit@@ or@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search and emphas@@ ize the various kinds of sour@@ texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be added to your book@@ marks . this is a separate kind of book@@ marks within the text . this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that they will be automatically assigned to the first input of a sign automatically .
the editing is probably one of the main asp@@ iring at using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; excellent features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; sources are always supported ; special commands for their selection . under processing , the following commands are included in the text selection :
consists of a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not meant to include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only per@@ ver@@ ted thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the down@@ s are separated by two empty lines .
according to the current cur@@ sor position , this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with an additional star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to listen to a part of the document , the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line can be removed first . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the complete line of key . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own commands to create a faster transmission . under Edit , the following commands are included in the text box :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit the paragraph of the paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under editing around a m@@ ful simple working with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is found in front of or within the command \ \ &apos; to the environment , it will be inj@@ ected at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of exac@@ erb@@ ated ambient commands can be lost quickly . this command is the most recently built environment so that the surrounding area structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are a few important commands to which are made from editing .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded c@@ ops .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the buck@@ le buck@@ le .
if the cur@@ sor is found before or behind the welded K@@ lam@@ mer of a &amp; tex ; group # is bound to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many past@@ ed groups of welded groups can be lost quickly , the most recent group , so that the den@@ ced structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups can not be dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used as G@@ Ã ¼ n@@ se@@ dan . for the purpose of the beginning it is used ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple beginnings . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and leads to two exact publication signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic process of double start @-@ up characters can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and be used .
it can also be used with specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and for German or French host@@ ility signs . there are also many other languages available .
at the wires of Shift ; add @-@ c@@ ate &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is inserted inside a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , if the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is not only a line of line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , connect &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ has a close line of line .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line bi@@ ased &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ line . this can be set up under settings . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be moved .
some users can assign the columns in tables and to arrange all the E@@ t sign ( amp ; ) among each other . if this Tab@@ ulator is not to be one of them . although this Tab@@ ulator is not to be one of them , for them &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ spaces are added to the columns position of the current tobacco .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code version , this has been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , it has been extended for various modes . all of these modes can be set up for automatic loading . all of these modes can be configured for different work@@ ings under settings .
at the beginning a new setting is done by the command \ \ &apos; to the environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the menu bar is removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and can be fully attributed to the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by typ@@ ing a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are mes@@ sured by selecting a command . alternatively , this is a simply jump to these positions by using Edit jumping stamps and the dar@@ ed parameters can be attached then .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; no@@ vial settings to these lists can be made . it can be used different wh@@ ale lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands throughout the general language used .
command mode does not allow for a few letters with \ \ &apos; to be entered and a large list with ambient conditions may be used . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments .
when calling the processing mode , the menu will be automatically applied to the menu pane or the key above , and it appears \ \ &apos; . after that , the environment will be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and will be termin@@ ated by wires of the input bar .
after this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a list of lists , is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings k@@ ile ; set ... k@@ ile ; configur@@ able settings to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of conditions for use &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line custom lists of ab@@ outs , which can instantly be replaced by l@@ ain@@ less strings . as an example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example , is contained L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X file .
for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word sub@@ mitt@@ ing mode is to be introduced to the menu editing or the button 1 Str@@ g + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
gro@@ ove are not helpful to fully automatically , however , that many officers in one document has been written more than once . thus it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the dispos@@ ition for all of them is already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu , set up a tile ... to be worn out . here , the swelling value for the ad placement can be specified .
the complete configuration files can be installed in the sub@@ folder for ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / Complete / Use / Use / Use / Use / / or personal / chest / fashion / or personal . mode is available for se@@ gregation ( ab@@ duction ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graphic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog designed the plain of graphics as simple as possible . to be aware of the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and be respected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for signs and new orders of pages . will the PDF output be notified , so the pages are re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to be able to consider the result of work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed into the menu creation comp@@ iling , creating change and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for be@@ holder like &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the other conversion can be used . afterwards , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS @-@ file by pressing Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by pressing Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when used in the command , normally a viewer is called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ bound viewer is used , each time will be a new window .
a new project will be asked about the project &quot; New Project .... &quot; the following information will be asked for the project :

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; contains lots of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us . all these tools use comple@@ mentary as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as pad . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; it knows that it is still a piece , we give it a graphics surface ! do not rely on a graphical interface ! simply click on a graphical interface ; just click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application uses an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found in the desired work folder , then remove the current work@@ folder , and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder , as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time when supposed pro@@ c is launched .
as I said , everyone who has been working at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already been working , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then let them start the current work@@ folder . if not , then select the current folder and specify the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported error and try again .

plug @-@ in plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; themselves might have little to do with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; this plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use it in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . read more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start plug@@ in with the menu plug@@ ins . thus the following dialog appears :
this dialog allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element inside :
here you can enter the path path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place it is used &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ ins .
often work on one project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; supports specif@@ ying team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog dialog .
the name and email addresses are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user name of the user and serves to identify unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and expresses the button S@@ etz@@ e as expresses . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fies ) appears fat after you are : text .
nickname and adjustment of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team there is another advantage to capture the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something is happening . see for more detailed information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be when a file is secured when a file is secured when a file is secured , or a script that is added to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the selected address selected in the recipient . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such leaders are set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter your comments is simple . you can choose either the note entry from the Editor Con@@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by clicking text .
observ@@ ations can be sent a determin@@ ing member of the team . in this case , the nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , which is the nickname of the project management team , is a role in the project from the following ways : team leader Ber@@ eich@@ s@@ Head Sub@@ project leader after reporting and sub@@ project names should be cited as in the examples below .
nickname and roll@@ ers names are independent of large or small , but spaces for stap@@ les and notes : make the note invalid .
&amp; quantitative ; is a development environment for script and form@@ atting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up using a Quant@@ a ... . Th@@ esis dialogue also extends over a few pages that follow each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion may be changed . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatic added tags . normal wholesale / to@@ en@@ rol@@ ment means that tags will be inserted as they are described in the everyday XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal wholesale / lower@@ case means the attributes will be inserted as they are described in the everyday XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
non optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags .
start and closing tag automatically update : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ ic types of detection of different types of files . using the default settings , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way than with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; created regularly backup copies , so that a power out@@ age or crash can be restored at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . no backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ or@@ area or a separate view ( or documentation ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the following start is useful when the user interface through alter@@ ations of the MDI mode and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views over each other . it corresponds with the --@@ stress @-@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message is used to control the warning of war@@ nings using warning from non longer qu@@ eries .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scrip@@ ting as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in divided mode . see the different modes .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which depic@@ ts the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change through clicking the structural tree with the mouse button un@@ solved action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can automatically be set to edit and how deep in a change in the structural tree is set automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document has no element . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area for determin@@ ing short@@ cuts ( some kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded in a wide range of templates , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; s , it can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; it can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; this means that it can be a valid group for Javascript than in a group .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are K@@ part @-@ Applications of third page that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in needs the following :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a stand@@ point like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be submitted to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Just @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ reading @-@ parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check @-@ in : is this enabled , then tests &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . then , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was designed completely new . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger , as well as support for db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implementation of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; add .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the option options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger enabled a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative interface ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view that lists all holding points , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view which is shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , are made , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ bug@@ ging demands . this action is opened by default , that a de@@ bu@@ gger is used , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger must not be considered .
the counter to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . close the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the lute to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to implement a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
if the de@@ bu@@ gger starts to start with the script and updates information about the monitored variables , as well as the current introduced , the execution continues . if this happens , before a debit request has started , the script will start with the requirement .
to start de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without any information to secure variables and the current line number , if this is done while a script is granted , the execution will be given before a debit card begins , as soon as a requirement is made .
de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without entering the functions or includes .
de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and includes faul@@ ts in local currency .
if de@@ bu@@ gger indicates the order to go and go to the next one , as there would not be the current .
open a dialog where a variable or an expression can be submitted , which is to be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; help to become better .
document type E@@ diti@@ onn@@ ete ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . they enable &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; abilities such as car completion and flexibility ; for fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; it is available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and / CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tool@@ bars are handmade , symbolic body of buttons ( above the editing window ) , which might include text and instructions faster in a document , as a user could je .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be assembled manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details to convert .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , an &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both specific attributes for tags and the content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es ; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML , and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information regarding the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is displayed in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but none else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class where this method is owned . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attributes group and attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( family 1 only )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only be used once for each attribute . additionally , there is another tags that should describe how this attribute is to be rendered &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
specifies the source codes for the attributes in tag editor and attribute tree to be used .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology . the arguments to be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur to an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur only once in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog , e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is an only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; quantum drop ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , check only when charging the Tag@@ XML files into &amp; quantitative .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML @-@ file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML @-@ file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; date name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is equally simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via DT@@ D . this can be di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ pt@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D _ / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set with settings ... created . click New Action for the same dialog :
&quot; &quot; &quot; this action assigned key symbol . with clicking the button &quot; button &quot; button &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; button can be assigned a button abbrevi@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with clamp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be submitted a text in the detailed settings and in execution of action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action we can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ dir message in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it is removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; by external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the listed methods , a script files can take from &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default input , input can be determined in the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the implemented application can also be edited . there are two types of issue : normal edition , to the default output ; error messages , to be specified on the default output written by default , by the value of the selection box edition is :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in this case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window at the bottom of the window .
fill out all necessary fields and add them the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes has , and you plan to use it , enable &quot; edit &quot; tag , &quot; if available , thus a input at using the action is possible .
ignor@@ ance ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their di@@ str@@ o ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size other .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
in regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually chosen to be interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user can be sign@@ aled , clicking this symbol is to insert it ; -@@ tag in the current document will be added .
after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected with action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there &apos;s what else is , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; functions to tool@@ bars or it should be shared for a better overview of some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool bar dialog for tool@@ bars . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element it should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the tool bar to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview a quick way to preview the Con@@ quer@@ or . I &apos;ll select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by Pro@@ b@@ ate all symbols to ensure everything works .
back in the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be applied to the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder , so that your tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like most . this is why I describes one &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository check if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you have to let the do@@ cr@@ c file . we &apos;ll need to handle the second part we handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path 1 , func@@ 1 , type 2 , tag@@ 2 , day 2 , tag@@ 2 , day 2 , day 3 func@@ itional 1 = func@@ iton 1 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html day 2 = tag@@ .@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 : order PHP 4.2 , PHP Reference = Basic syntax , # Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Getting started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known fron@@ tier for hor@@ rend@@ itions ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to one file ( and consistent at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; mark . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; Resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the context of context sensitive help . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and easily back to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / Quant@@ a / doc ) in the same folder like do@@ cr@@ c and copying your HTML documentation .
if you are sure to be shared , you will send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to use the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to be involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is a menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bars and folders in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them and use only if our team needs them as correct and used for publication . to make a use@@ full contribution , why it guarantees a GP@@ G / PGP key . thus , the source of resources is assured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading can be asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you have several keys you can select one . in the dialogue New resource you have to stay empty ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the load can be started .
upload the upload set by the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload , tool@@ bars and files in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; in case of problems it warns , and it may be canc@@ eled . please note the warning message and the resource is given correctly , a message appears with the specif@@ ying of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quantitative , but it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be necessary in everyday XML format . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D package into a DT@@ D package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and convert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target identification : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ ing line : the string that in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; according to the conversion &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to understand these fundamental concepts , this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ anti@@ qu@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quantitative , the field is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; uses , available . by tool@@ bars over actions everything is stored , in common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool bars , actions and samples in a global tree , which will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personal .
project @-@ related elements are available only within one particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ o@@ gli@@ ding .
the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some basic areas : the editing window , the device driver with information and tool bar . please beat in , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click the box leader with the right mouse button , to re@@ load a context menu with the current document matching entries , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ or@@ area leads to a further context menu regarding the processed document , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the word under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file , if the string signi@@ fies a file below the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor is the tool bar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert the icon that the tag represents . now , you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to add a tag ( such as anchor ) , you can fill up multiple fields in a dialog .
projec@@ tions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to be qu@@ anti@@ ated in the information on &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with ant@@ en@@ chan@@ gers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scrip@@ ting , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool designed &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; it displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates can be found in the project .
here you find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to run , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by clicking on an element it opens a list of commands to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . it allows to change the content of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited projects .
by default &amp; quantum ap@@ l@@ us ; two cartridges at the bottom of the window , via the useful information can be reached : the news window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about each in a quantum running script . for example , the actual DT@@ D used for the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed are all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ um ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate sauce of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own orders as symbols in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; K@@ mail ; if they can get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; like any others secure and charge !
it is reasonable when you want to custom@@ ize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; auto@@ conf has a number of options to get handed over to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . you should also ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers have started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able mark@@ up languages editor would be ? well , this would be the absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer rely on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; it should be suitable &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; it follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why does someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to extend how to need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can also increase productivity . by self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars ; extend it without any scrip@@ ting syntax syntax . ( more about it they will find in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and has been developed rapidly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers fors@@ ook the GPL licensed and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; run , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ fix _ file , only an error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters included in the clip@@ board , so that they appear correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting .
converts the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; which is the correct way to add special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
turn off the block selection . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; key to choose .
go straight to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that is the window where you see the display of scrip@@ ting and de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; main sequence star . the problem rep@@ orter is activated when you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol turn left from the main window . this column allows you to put bookmark with a mouse click .
if book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu under the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored in the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . it allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder , or to add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more / output modules ( C@@ io Sl@@ aves ) .
att@@ itudes as &amp; quantum @-@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative , you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select the tool@@ bar type : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will only create the name . actions must be saved via tool@@ bars and they will be asked using tool@@ bars and you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; - Team , that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else did and convert into the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; own sound @-@ format .
un@@ loading / auff@@ eur of entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is wise to renew the entities out of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is necessary to renew the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not provided , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is downloaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tag , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or disabled the smart insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us is denied by tool@@ bars if this day does not contra@@ dict the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu item . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ in activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax index mode for the current file . the list of available approaches depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of line alignment . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to the development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document according to the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using external use T@@ id@@ y .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu has an entry for every open sub@@ window . by selecting a contract the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantum drop ; main plug @-@ in or off .
changes in this dialog will affect any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , one finds details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them , and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; development in financial form will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , as for example , after filling the project name , all directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Tab .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing name , file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces marked with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine where you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Un@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted rather than the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you need to download and change static we@@ bin@@ ar you want to download and change . by ser@@ ver@@ page scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of using .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook , or by removing the bun@@ ches , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu pane in the sub@@ window profiles or with the key@@ note shift Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations like about project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be configured with the Options button . in search , the de@@ bug@@ ging can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can also be adjusted , as well as an advertisement of a tree view to the contents of the server for any profile , drawing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , you can turn off event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions if a previously determined event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; quantitative eas@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behaviour at the moment .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; it is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project management offers free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
folder be@@ have as well , but are missing the entries opening and open with ... in the right click context menu :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if only more profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removing the removal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will be kept in the core and forget at Program@@ mes . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more un@@ secure password on the disk -@@ option does not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; many high@@ land profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed c@@ io slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator manages a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave it is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone can see with programming language .
a project view is only one set of files and tool bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple di@@ ps of view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the relevant open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; with which one has most to do . it helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; to their own working methods .
as already mentioned above are tool bars in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; best about the tool@@ bars on the tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding tool bar is treated below in the section add tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set on either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the tool@@ bar can be configured , tool@@ bars , tool@@ bars and tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and the action work , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the promotions on them can set up and set up actions in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set up actions .
templates are in key document@@ ing , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; uses templates in principle like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you select for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ anti@@ d@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set exactly before using any template .
binary is all that is not a pure text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary form . binary templates are normally inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates . further information about templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text @-@ document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in the pre @-@ store space under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are to be found in the pre @-@ store space under global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a file structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template As you save as a local template ....
once that is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the project tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template where you can save selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and put on the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a file folder . it can be used to copy all file management functions , such as pulling and paste or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right or the project files to create a folder and secure a name for the template . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
projec@@ tions enable a very target @-@ oriented subur@@ b . you can add @-@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , paste files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things in using projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / share / mail@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders represents one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder with the right button of the mouse , click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led , as soon as ter@@ restri@@ al attributes are av@@ owed .
this is enabled by default , and fits all except the regular folder in the system overview . if a regular folder would be set , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder .
allows previous or re@@ written text for templates in this folder . this could be general header and foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p copy of the files into a folder with special header lines / leg lines .
in addition , you can use the context menu ( to indicate the right mouse button ) for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode is replacing the code editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second , the code window will divide into two parts : the code text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it gives a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and be visible in the source code as required in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL , editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is necessary to edit this code . there are no plans to modify this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor synchron@@ ously , this mode is already active , puts the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings after a click or automatically select the option . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted : a small ju@@ g for quick computers and a big span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to edit the documentation of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this allows to change the manual code . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by clicking the two buttons below . a click into the list allows key words in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents of the keyword .
CSS rules are the new way to design pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change on the list . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is possible like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved like usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or by pressing bar or remo@@ del@@ ing .
inser@@ tion tags will be made in the same way through the tool bar , such as the source text editor , such as an anchor day not removed , e.g. if an anchor day is inserted , surrounded with text , any other circum@@ ference tag needs to be removed .
some tool bars like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .

there are many graphics tools for comparison . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ing many changes made . another programmer had changed much text at the same time . a further programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in merge .
the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within the lines . and there was no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the inser@@ tion had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later any number of other useful functions have been added .
if you wish to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function turned and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
3 @-@ way merge operation is also fully supported . this is useful when two persons are independent from each other to one piece Ko@@ de work and make changes . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three source files when assem@@ bling :
&amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and run complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and are similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines are shown only in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in column on the left side . ( no trouble if somebody changes the deposit . )
if a file is equal , and the others differ in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color indicates that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can facilitate the ti@@ pp@@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
con@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ inary Fol@@ der 2 - Fol@@ der sub@@ folder : diff@@ 3 folder sub@@ folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the Open dialog allows to manually enter the file name , select the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down file . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences are done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge folder will be introduced . if a file is selected , for B and C , use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merge operation is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before beginning with the same / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialogue , you don &apos;t need to select the dialog using the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and insert them : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains one file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much these functions are , it would be only two corresponding files . you would then need to copy two corresponding files , and then compare it . now you can easily copy , paste , and then compare it .
note : there is currently nothing out of &amp; diff@@ use . only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and lay text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every way to a file is to rest . ( note that Windows C is optional . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source records are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , the default color is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) .
links next to the text is the summar@@ ization column . if differences were found , the colour is shown . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only in strings and comments , for the Pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the line file has no lines . when the line of line is checked , the line is punc@@ tured on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison table ) also has an information line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you already have the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts has been resolved is saving disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons to next remaining / un@@ resolved conflict around the still remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is to be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually .
by clicking a click with the left mouse button in a window the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump to the current group . ) This group will then emphas@@ ise the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , by automatic editing or by manual editing no more line remains in the group ; then there is only a plac@@ eholder for the case . this text is not only a different source . this text is neither displayed in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge con@@ forms ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go c@@ auti@@ ous with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , but you can use the arrow keys left , right , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . if you can also use it from other programs , you can also click navig@@ ating to navigate directly to the navigation bar .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and writ@@ able mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ized columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows onto the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section ) and explained the ed@@ itable output window .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip forward to the current / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ up ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all un@@ solved conflicts can also be regarded as conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is checked , you will automatically copy the clip@@ board . by using this option , however , be careful , because you could easily over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
c@@ edar will be stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ up sign of \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems are not able to use Wag@@ en@@ roll@@ ers + c@@ ann@@ en@@ fe@@ eder \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not re@@ use the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( Settings menu setting &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically displays an un@@ just color .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press or return Return , the line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board . manual copying into the clip@@ board then falls .
you can select which Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly common selection on the operating system used .
when using files is trying &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines are to be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . the second step is not ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . too , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a line boot sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then files can only be displayed with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , although they are different . when this option has to be disabled . during the merge , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option has to be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters .
default is disabled by default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively for smaller differences . the option is activated in pre@@ ference . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files .
in automatic @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continuing .
solve automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in chapter to scan folders and conduct a merge . look for details at documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version will be app@@ ix . if already such a backup file is installed with the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart the current running program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted globally through the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry . if you use this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
on the selection fields for encoding is a brief indication of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters can be treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can define what coding needs to be used .
if you define imagination , you may not work with your Code@@ c . ( for example , your files may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can only handle 16 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output command .
turn it off to op@@ press release of changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ lay column with the information required .
sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; arrange the comparison window by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you look at the differences and decide to merge the files into the merge menu , even if you only use two files . a simple click is to start merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , the name of the recently used output file is retained . )
when reading a file it will be delivered to this external command first . in &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut out interference or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given to this external command to command this command . if the command of the command is specified , the output command is only used when typ@@ ing it . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your own pre@@ processor . every input line must have a corresponding edition line .
the idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when creating the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
in this context , use this process command to convert c@@ line to file size : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; s / \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; s . * \ \ &apos; is an erg@@ istic expression of the text displayed on each string . the \ \ U refers to the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add text files ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ st@@ itution ) . all follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word ( \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you might like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line ab@@ sed . sed &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different from per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the pre@@ set &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal Pre@@ processor are retained for the display and to merge operation . further operations do only change the data that the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ us @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal processor , the line @-@ off processor will see the output of normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you cannot acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare it with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... making a proposal to merge for each object ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulate and display the sim@@ ulated changes without having it really done ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of single files . you only need to specify folder on command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target file is specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start together , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow )
during the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then .
when the scanning of the folders is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder of the file found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object using a simple mou@@ sec@@ lick .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the property or select the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub@@ directories . open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the name Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be chosen automatically . if the merge operation is rest@@ art@@ ed , you will be informed about any problems of this kind .
as shown in the above image , the colors A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black .
identical entries , however , the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folder will have the same color . in case of folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge can not be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge can not be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sync mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary promotion is identical to that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only the visible file name for the output file only B ; straight after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ secure ) , then the files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ es such mistakes can not be removed , the merge of the folders can &apos;t be started .
during the merge , a file is processed by the other . it status column displays he@@ at@@ ly when the merge operation was successful , and other messages , if something unexpected has been completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is fine .
if in alignment dialog the file comparable method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts can only be displayed if three folders can be compared or assembled . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at one time . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( even in all sub @-@ guides ) , you can run the merge .
please note : if you have not specified any target file , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , C will be used as an objective and used for synchron@@ ising A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder , too . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in the folder &apos;s folder . check these options to avoid un@@ de@@ ar@@ able surprises :
to bring all entries together : select the directory and proceed in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key symbol ) . to execute only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting data types still exist sub@@ merged actions , a message appears on the incorrect elements . they can select a valid action for them .
when you run all entries , a dialog window appears to run through , Sim@@ ulating and breaking .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen picture ) .
if you are ready with a file , select File Station to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 appears ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; referring to a mistake , a message and detailed status information is displayed . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that are going to help you to choose the cause of the problem or to solve the problem of the problem , before you can resolve the problem before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were merged individually , you can see &amp; use diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not be appearing in later , these entries will be taken as closed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified patterns are displayed in the element tree . you can define the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divider . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divider . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be specified using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file system files , files are a attribute . in other fil@@ esystem , you can select one file as hidden . this option allows you to specify if these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
in case of links to folders : when the option is switched off , the links are checked out as normal folders . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is switched on ) , the links will be checked and recur@@ sively . ( note that this option would lead to an end loop and drop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is switched off in default .
execute a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statist@@ ic columns . ( the number of un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files which contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
when you compare large folders through a slow network , you may compare it faster , only the chan@@ ges@@ et and the file size . please use caution when using caution . please note that this option is off default .
similar to confi@@ dential date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when when copying the chan@@ ges@@ date has been lost . please use caution when copying the chan@@ ges@@ date . please note : this option is off default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals for merge operation are selected . the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered uncertain because the other file is not altered as well . you should check it in any case . ) This option is checked in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ original If an old backup file is already existing , it will also affect the normal merge of single files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge list remains visible to the merge of single files ; you can switch off the shut@@ ters with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch off the window / text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , in the directory menu , you can also specify a single file directly from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be done again and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you enter the directory again : list menu : new : read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the aid of K@@ io @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relatively small . or .. .@@ that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank line &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit author@@ iz@@ ations or change date . therefore , turn the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note that this option is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of the purpose is currently as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first the built @-@ in difference @-@ viewer . to view the right mouse button above the difference @-@ viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally it needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a K@@ part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name must exist in the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it doesn &apos;t work if the original files have changed since generation of patch file .
if &amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the part @-@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is Kom@@ pare ) . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone this way or going to go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not compiled the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . by default , configure the configure process in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are actually treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not the same . i@@ F .
the editor is noted for each difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
the effort therefore was too big so far . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit greater quantities of text , another editor should be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text , no sr@@ c is swe@@ pt ; no sr@@ c has been swe@@ pt ; and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can that be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; S@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis is conf@@ using and mis@@ used the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you must restart after changes to the folder with the function refresh . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder cannot be copied into the target folder , if the target folder already contains these files , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with Lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group . if the lines are already present , they will be removed during clicking on the button .
this option is disabled by default . understanding differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature view of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the work@@ spaces , to change their size , or change it . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running . applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; when it was clicked on , the context menu only has the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . only appears when clicked on a application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when clicked on a application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on Desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
inter@@ lock this field allows the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . it is named together with name , the names with ordin@@ ated numbers will be provided , cover ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background is also displayed as a background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to make their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here may be the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it can be determined in a 2x@@ n grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical range , which is very good for the display at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it is running outside the control bar .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; it is a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers , and people with a visual im@@ itation . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to extend new features . it is optimized for use on efficient computers .
when you &amp; k@@ mag ; it appears as shown above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following this window is shown as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is described as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is a larger area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor like a mov@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can visu@@ alize a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surrounding area of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently it is not able to detect the form of the mouse pointing device . this is always the default k@@ ite ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window .
in addition , press the &amp; Shift key ; push or download the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down will stand firmly and just move the lower right corner .
&amp; may ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer into a file to copy the clip@@ board ( to turn it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the updating of the display . the stops of updating is that the needed CPU time goes up against 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very low , straight , means , high , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , Open a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ers ( using the button document back in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ c@@ ers &amp; etc ; .
k@@ ill@@ fier also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use it as if you use a micro@@ scope to use the clari@@ fier in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artist to the web designer or visually han@@ dic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the cur@@ sor is waiting for a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and to which each mouse click p@@ ains . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a bit of exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also consult pain associated with using your computer , if you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid when using the mouse , it is against pain caused by the desire of mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aux@@ iliary equipment : the result can drop for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the smart shifting activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . the smart shi@@ fts requires a little exercise but you get used to get used quickly .
this delay time must be stored in the end of the mouse , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mou@@ sec@@ lick .
is Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es move on , the turn@@ field shi@@ fts ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here is the time set , the m@@ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after signing the mouse button is waiting before the mouse is reset again , if there is no reference to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking by clicking the mouse button . if this function is enabled , a slow beam to the right and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a slide sound buffer where you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the antenna site .
if this setting is selected , it is m@@ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please go to the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program .
sets all settings back to the values that were set up when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button on the button after the final push of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the pres@@ ets . in particular , smart shi@@ fts should be used first . if you are used to automatically click the automatic mouse , you can later take the smart shi@@ fts .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it should be necessary to reduce the antenna site of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not display a link , do not park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse has ru@@ ined , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you want to watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun a move , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not stop by the release of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can use a mouse click . this is reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over where you want to make it . but if you don &apos;t want to make a mouse on a neutral area of mind , if you don &apos;t want to cause any button of mouse click . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title rows of windows .
I am trying to work with smart shi@@ fts , but I do not create it to edit text .
smart shi@@ fts is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it again . it is very likely to execute it in the clip@@ board or to add any other action . but it will probably cause them to prepare problems . here are some advice :
do not use smart shi@@ fts if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on the end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse cur@@ sor over the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse button . this way , it will always press a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when smart shi@@ fts starts to use the shi@@ fts time . later , you can use smart shi@@ fts without the audi@@ ble mouse . but it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; installed . that should be the case for most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and are equipped correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; made the mouse button soon as soon as the cur@@ sor is cur@@ ly dist@@ orted . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and for those affected by the Mau@@ sta@@ ing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is let release . in this way , pulling and laying down with the mouse can be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the mu@@ te users can leave their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let users speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the round @-@ round phrases which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the language edition of text . further details will be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second side you can choose the standard text password . you can often choose the text pass@@ ers without requiring them to type . the text passages may of course be edited .
on the third side ( right screen picture ) determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ th@@ ening . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can also read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly and contains basically a input field for the key@@ presses of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen picture ) and a reference memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in screen picture ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the phrases you want to hear . every spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select the phrases you want once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog includes two flash@@ cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the site Wor@@ th@@ ening and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the select field , you specify the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text will not be shared as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you can find this command in the documentation of your language generator . see the examples below .
if possible , use as a lingu@@ istic service as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language . if this is successful , the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently a standardized interface for voice output . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop of action after the selection of a text passage , choose which action is triggered by the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation or by selecting a text passage in the &quot; Text passages &quot; menu or in the bar for text fitting .
with the selection of So@@ fort he will speak the chosen text passage directly and added to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text@@ passage is only entered into the input field .
using the second drop @-@ down menu of the editing window for Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can specify if the text @-@ link can be saved when closing the editing window will be saved automatically .
with the selection of Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the text password is not stored . select before saving , &amp; k@@ mouth will ask if the word @-@ register is to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; side Wor@@ th@@ ening contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ th@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth . in the main window , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop down , you can choose the currently used dictionary for the recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , or export them in a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation : the frequency of the individual words will simply be determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can add the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only true words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can bring the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries should be merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocab@@ ulary .
the main area of the window for processing Text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding button . if you select a text link book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages from pulling with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text box is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the storage cache .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text box is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the storage cache .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected phrases of the storage cache .
if this menu entry is locked , the tool@@ bar will be displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow body is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text fitting books is displayed directly below the tool bar . by clicking on the cut@@ ted left side and pulling can the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have entered the command for voice output not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card voice . ( see Settings dialog for language syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and circul@@ ate without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command for voice is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and circul@@ ate without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for the set @-@ up command , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ ak . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched ON as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . therefore , it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to Phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax enjoys the last sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat . ; echo &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ us@@ r / local / ep@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data must be switched on as default input .
the speech dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language services , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ application is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s systems .
as the adjustment of the language generator is done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the t@@ elec@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language support , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can &apos;t talk to spend text through the computer . a list of pro@@ spective phrases can be saved , which can ever re @-@ release the user ane@@ w .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers included . on the calcul@@ ator , a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( specify either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a system consisting of modules that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers are prepared to provide applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also , users also offer interesting options .

additionally to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de Acc@@ essibility mailing list . you can also find the list on htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility . you can also find the developers in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you must install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are furnished , the card box is shown . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , such as different male , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is designated as speaker . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts . you should use the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several pres@@ ets for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box on kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the map speaker is displayed . it will then automatically start if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and is not yet a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speaker appears above in the list . the top speaker is used for the speech output when there is no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a click of the list , select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
using a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
using a mouse click on this button , and click on this button to push the spokes@@ man on the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System apply .
choose a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls to choose from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . go back to the card card General and check if voice output starts using ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . see . now you can read and manage text . please click on the map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Res@@ cue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab . please click on the map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create and manage text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the language system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card &apos;s tab card to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text contracts and read it . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the box is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the Control bar system , it dis@@ appears once the procedure is completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start writing mot@@ ions , cancel , stop and record again .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; add the clip@@ board or select a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on user &apos;s or OK , then all the changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then , check the text that is read before , and select the text in the main menu . after short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then , check the text that is read before , and select the text in the main menu . then , the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , how &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of the events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , in a IR@@ C channel a message appears where your nickname has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for Not@@ ify differ according to application .
filters for the character set offer a good way to correct ones ; incorrect or correct to correct the messages ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is delivered to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can be accepted by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted as assum@@ ing . read it also .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts , filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering text , text is processed before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace in@@ explic@@ able words or short@@ cuts to b@@ ypass a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four kinds of lyrics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen re@@ axes has the highest priority . it will be raised to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning message .
News have the next sth@@ and priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can welcome a long text on a website . &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can also use the room . &amp; k@@ de ; Not@@ ices are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text contracts . any order that you use from the card card is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text contracts . text contracts are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order packages are processed in queu@@ e , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filter should never be applied to the output of screen re@@ ments . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filters work the text and keep it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can be further types of fil@@ tering .
string markings replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will enable you to submit messages from chat messages like : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the scope of delivery &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . if you are sent to a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about this . read more about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he does not apply for a voice output . if the filter does not apply , he will keep the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a not@@ ifying , warning or a cr@@ e ; send not@@ ices to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the side below . the processing is executed in the order in the list below .
this shows the list of the submitted normal filter . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed up down@@ wards from the top down .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will be shown further below the following setup dial@@ ogs .
you need to insert a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , the text will be exchanged for their replacement parts . big and lower@@ case is not subject to comparison .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbit@@ rar@@ ily , it must only differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter re@@ sembles the text with character strings in the column , and replaced it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately from comm@@ a . example : conversation , mail
you can get the d@@ bus @-@ running program with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; you have to leave the d@@ bus number . if you are , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ant ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 is available , you may only copy only copied .
the string filter filter will only be applied to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ eses filter when co@@ inci@@ de . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compar@@ ing words , the default filter commands regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can download it in the dial@@ ogs . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; - Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c aid program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker filters you can send texts to a certain nar@@ rator , which is set up on the map voice , or specify a speaker with certain traits . for example , you can specify that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text for the lyrics . the speaker is based on the actors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the speaker is selected according to the actors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the speaker is selected . with the speaker filter , you can over@@ write the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the text is registered here , the filter will be applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can call this with one click on the button to get help when typ@@ ing .
to achieve a faster processing , try to anch@@ oring the regular expression at the beginning of string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the properties of the customer required by you . if the text meets the filter conditions described above , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements on the most desired requirements . click on the button to show the dialogue menu .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ man filter will only apply to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ eses filter if you apply . you must add a condition at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD can be added , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language delivery services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
there is text in the text to read and select a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; con@@ no@@ des ; window . do not launch a window in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; series XML ; but with use of the module for the festival , web pages will not be read .
due to a bug in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work . you can also do that if you do not use this voice to read from web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or inter@@ ventions may seem to cause error when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ or@@ der@@ mis . what can I do ?
first , make sure that the option of character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . is there problems with certain signs or words , this may be solved by a string fixing filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information , which are not yet contained in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for XML ; conversion filter is not necessary , but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment by K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source codes from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or you have downloaded Tar@@ ball from the source code , and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts that uses the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script spl@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can re@@ lie@@ ve sat@@ z@@ - or ab@@ dic@@ ally , repeat the output or break off .
if you want an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be used for example , if you want to set up the properties of the preferred ator for the output . if you want to find a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , otherwise the best matching actors will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can see a speaker , see in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or click Edit , the map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is displayed as an example of the module for the Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path is included in PAT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; these settings are automatically made . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak . ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these tracks , you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this gray , the voice of you chosen cannot be chosen by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to load multiple seconds due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are loaded faster by the initial set of memory , so that the first sentence is faster by the first set .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click on users ) .
if this check box is marked on the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system scope as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . thus , you have the possibility to navigate or otherwise control them .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just finished set . the speaker ID is based on the ID on the card box .
with buttons in this series you can bet on the order that is selected in the list below , forward or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text contracts are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . have you select the PCM device here .
make the microphone speed here an . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal voice speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program should be So@@ x installed .
click on Custom@@ ers to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose the standard .
on this card card you can set special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language orders :
the output of screen re@@ axes has the highest priority . it will be raised to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader was read , the retained jobs will be resumed .
al@@ er@@ ts have the next priority priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just send a long text on a website , you can welcome &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you just enter the room .
a text job is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . when both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card only apply to normal text contracts . for news , war@@ nings , and spending of screen re@@ axes , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Not@@ ify messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ if@@ ications .
check this check box to switch the read of &amp; k@@ de ; Not@@ ification is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no messages .
if this setting is marked , not@@ if@@ ications , where a sound is played , is played by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , sending &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this drop down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; if an event meets , you have the following selection :

the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling the voice , voice of voice , and pitch . moreover , SS@@ ML code is part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently support &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default language , the festival is used by the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this allows you to start reading &amp; cancel earlier times , as only the first sentence can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not to jump down or cancel or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal filter . you can change its settings or add a further set @-@ up filter , but it is not recommended .
at the easiest way you can learn the setup of the speaker selection . turn off the speaker selection and check out the speaker selection . please switch off the speaker selection and check out how the choice of the speaker changed . of course , you need to change more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then , quicker with the preview can start , as only the first set must be processed and not all text block , which can last very long ,
you can stop or cancel text proposals on the card &apos;s card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter is automatically set up , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down only . do not change anything on this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ positi@@ vity filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular separ@@ ator ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal limits ( tab card automatically from the text ) . note that the default inspection filter must be provided .
S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ . ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen re@@ axes .
if you have removed the normal Sat@@ z@@ limit@@ er filter , you can insert it by entering the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map menu , you can write the settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
using the default speaker ( the top on the speaker map ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most suitable spokesperson . if you do not delete or edit the Properties of the Spre@@ ader , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker chooses . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which equ@@ ates the original properties originally submitted .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties , by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select the Properties of the desired Spre@@ ader here . if this feature does not matter , you don &apos;t give anything .
check this check box if the property should have priority prior to other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when compar@@ ing the output , it is always used as a prime feature . you will not use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker , which corresponds to the e@@ he@@ els of the following , click the select button and then use on speakers that comp@@ lies with the following .
in this case , 0 is standing for the last text job in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( no order number is required for input 0 ) .

on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to allow this to be able to install the program Instant , and via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers module such as Festival Interactive provide a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read it by your own tags , with which the speed is controlled by your HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re very cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML @-@ re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the microphone speed up .
I can &apos;t make it read that websites are read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; enabling the management of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ines and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configured it , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . the device in all displays and setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the install of &amp; Linux ; it will be added and set up network devices later , you will need to load the drivers according to the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when selecting network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this platform is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose the distribution and rele@@ asing it &apos;s best . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ ask , the setting can be permanently hit . when setting the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed grey , which means change parameters can only be viewed . by clicking the button management system at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
the whole functionality of the module is available in the system management system . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the tab network interfaces can be carried out in the following tasks :
set up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog device can be mach@@ ined .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to reach the dialog with further possibilities .
with the automatic selection , the TCP / IP settings are made from an DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for the system as well . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be selected according to the system .
with the manual gearbox , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be specified . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is checked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization cannot be desired , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . if the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict , you can determine if the required address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled depending on your needs . on @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off network device , check out the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specify the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ network , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if computer file htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the computer sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ ing the name resolution part of the rider name resolution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or change . DNS entries can be converted into a list with buttons and up or down in the list .
by clicking on the button Add ... from the Group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button Add . the entry is then inserted into the list .
from the Group calcul@@ ator to name resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button editing .... It will be shown the Edit menu .
the well @-@ known computer software describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for boats when no DNS servers is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list nam@@ esp@@ ace includes some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will support . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer , and click Add .... The dialog of New alias will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias names , de button add several times and enter another alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The Find dialog box will be displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings required in the module network settings are not immediately in system . to activate the changes you have to be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command needs to be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the newest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de is installed and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical surface as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; B does not suff@@ ice , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others .
only experienced users are recommended . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be done .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . changing configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace ongoing knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC will be convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never seen great dis@@ semin@@ ation . from IPv6 it is expected to focus on the common IP@@ v4 protocol .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that is IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet , hence their application is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which operates as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are stored and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as specified .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ ony . another stand can occur as expected .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; print dialog . if you select outs , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the cr@@ ont@@ ab command to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to answer a surface for tar , which offered the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to the fast , sel@@ ective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife showed : how much longer is it when you make sure ?
before a band can be used , it must be from &amp; k@@ dat . it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; if the band returns and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . recognise &amp; k@@ dat ; the procedure on the band will not be asked if the tape is to be form@@ at@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; it is looking for the right index on your record . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape is bound . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry into the tape .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol of symbol for the tape , the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be cast out without any danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it needs to be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this procedure must not be form@@ at@@ ted before using &amp; k@@ dat . if your band drive must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually set a form@@ atting of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the formation , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the secure files . it can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be secured .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right button of the mouse click on the local file tree and select in the S@@ ure menu ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog for backup . in this dialog you can check out the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives associated with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was launched , the dialog for Chec@@ king Settings . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files that are to be restored to be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives created with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for restore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for the recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of recovery and data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ File based on the tape . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of tape :
this is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings :
the current work@@ folder in which the backup should be done . the list of securing files is automatically updated to the right working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can separate separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot files are secured , which have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot files in front of the command of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drives ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ location version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transm@@ itting &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is bound to load the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , locking &amp; k@@ dat ; this setting doesn &apos;t work on all band drives .
if the option is switched ON , the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . do not use Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , it tries &amp; k@@ dat . not all drives support variable log sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the log @-@ size will tell you .
if &amp; dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The tape ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby the host@@ name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the ep@@ och has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; tar tar . even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a tape is bound .
&amp; K@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; be@@ holder for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system , for example , users have access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; K@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified account of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems related to their server . &amp; K@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; K@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily fil@@ tering the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily and sort out . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the system tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol of the system is to be opened , and it will not appear with system administrator right . the protocol files are usually not shown under Linux , usually in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also filter the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or after entered character set . in default , the list of log lines will be displayed . in default , a protocol line will only be displayed if one of the columns contain the string of the filter pattern .
you can also select another entry in this place . for example , in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , select the process process only with entries in the protocol . so , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default settings and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of the level note . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be disabled .
if you want to display certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process , for example , if you want to investig@@ ate the output of a certain command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option To activate new lines in the main window , to view all new coming protocol lines .
&amp; K@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open up and manage these entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in menu to display .
&amp; K@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. . find out more about the sources of resources &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it System is rapidly developing as standard for control of the system start @-@ up in the &amp; Linux system . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ am and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to re@@ build a machine on System V In@@ it without any re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you &apos;ll need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed there if there were there one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead right in / etc . this folder called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start on an other run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on its part in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t want to use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point , you can disc@@ ard a look at the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it through your in@@ ward changes . if you have something different , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does all the right scripts start ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , every entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is so written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the htt@@ pd server . it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script is called by the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which is only htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; run also . furthermore , I could also have a user Run@@ level ; &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not tri@@ vial . just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six round level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ ables , or change the position within one level by taking it somewhere else . this happens only if they remove an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved to a new range . to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers before you can try again to add the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the various work@@ areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous ones .
to shift one entry into another round level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the input button to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before being executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts to new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ ward and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , how system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately doesn &apos;t simpli@@ fy the configuration for the proprietary integration programs in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a expansion of the programme for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) can be easily accessed without any message if their configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of the Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either using the tool@@ bar symbol or the entry Save in the menu file .
&amp; user interface ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some flash@@ cards will only be displayed if you have an extended system settings . only if you can carry out extended system settings , if you are able to make individual settings . other card cards appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed .
the password management map appears , if shadow passwords or such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card is only activated and initi@@ alized if for at least one @-@ bound fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the limitations in KB are :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for any fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the file system .
the card groups are informed about the group of the chosen users . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field of Pri@@ m@@ ese group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , check this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select the user or group menu , or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or delete the selected user or the selected group will be analogue .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager to add , remove and change the boot time , add the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , add , modify , change OS@@ es , change , and more .
