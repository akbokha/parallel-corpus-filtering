<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & fsview; is there to display dissident folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is portrayed by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the sum of the size of the subordinated objects of a object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; this is the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is specified. in this way, large files can be easily detected, even if they are widely detected in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & fsview; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX commands.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap display a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation use the rectangles of meaningful colouring and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on colour mode, can be either a depth for slight detection of disappearance or the figure of another file names such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify if there is enough space for displaying, or if there are enough space for displaying, or if the area of subordinated means can be used. in addition, you can specify the relative position of lettering in a rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for Treemaps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry, and this frame is not always available. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a division takes place an entry of an entry for subordinated entries, the implementation will be left so far to avoid that rectangle are possible. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns, or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal displayed surface for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a preload pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually shown by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy about your site. if you were able to make enough photos in one year. if you have enough photos, then you will be able to use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use the folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as reversion of the photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% work files will be added and you will then need to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the forklifts easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in the file format; this is sure that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget, then you can also save the metadata from the database by selecting the appropriate point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do that & digiplug is available; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you need to select any photo keywords, labels and an assessment. of course, you can choose all the images you need to add the same attribute. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's proceed with keywords, keywords, as you are often called by other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloglyzed images from another source, then it will be digious; automatically insert the images to the right place. the changing of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by pulling one subtree to another. the modified keywords are being done by & digious; updating while it pursues the trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics display like different metadata. this is a very rough representation, because each bloc of metadata in truth is composed of many sections. filenames and calendar data have properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool for your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to just see no one of your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to take care of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. far from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the lettering has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help you understand about the motive that moves you about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "with & digiplug, you can save a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), you can even use spell checker for a selection of images simultaneously." "" "" "" if you can use your images in web galleries and then you will have to tell you the title of the web gallery. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train leaves the spatial presentation right now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolocalization are already countless. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your trips virtually. you can also export the photos at the location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denoting the practice the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information has been found in the setup page of & digiplug; as information requested is:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field ought to add your name, or the name of the person, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, for example, if it is not desired, the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support Commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autositel (synonym for author line): links with the author. examples may be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memorandum to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider's vendor to identify who is not necessarily the author. if the photograph is listed here. if the picture is listed here, the picture is shown here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency is shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, though this has no protection against abuse. each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator. this problem is for the majority of your photos only by low interest. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digiplug; in the near future we will provide such a module for forklifts processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, record out, current, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also get CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course, you can claim more than a few years. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece has a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it lies in your messaging area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write a lot of reliable. so it is about to choose the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you are only written to protect. 75% of the data is only effective data, the remainder of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favorable program called IsoBuster, that doesn't work miracles on CDs and DVDs. it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to store the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk is able to store up to 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that was said to CDs and DVDs are also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the data back to a well-known media in a non-proprietorian format. if you want to check the data back to a clean, dark dry and in front of animals. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media, before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer-oxidants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a big field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disfails</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos are holding the most frequent cause of error in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. some of the most common error codes, SMART, can not determine the immediate imminent failure. these are especially Lesefehler and Verlagsors. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally caused without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment does not make a lot of power, this can cause heavy damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed receptors. these can cause severe damage to hardcore, hardwood age, hardcore age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against rains is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy storage and the rest is normally absorbed. but remember that not every plug bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should consider that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protect the protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because you can use overvoltage of any cable to your computer, you should also consider that all peripherals can be connected to your system. other manufacturers provide overvoltage vibration and also a phone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">"" "" "" "while an overvoltage protection your system is protected against smaller fluctuations in the power lines. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply." ""</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically start the battery energy when a power outage occurs. some models allow you to save your data back up to the current. if you need a UPS to keep the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compared to avoid them with power disorders at the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can you get up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive below & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only used as a solution to local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general securing solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and Photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included a backup and partial storage. thus they are despotable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transfer chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs are at least ensure the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission losses because they generate intereferencing within the data flows. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still the alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that use zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss during the notebook and 46% in the workbench systems. notebooks now amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most. it leads to a lower damage, for example theft or reinstallers. and there is currently only very few viruses and under Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of preventive process during a sudden break is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 iris settings removed from fundamental physical borders. meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and spatial characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras are your limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full format sensor (24x36 mm) or bigger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk can be managed today for 100 & euro; so you don't want any other data loss for data loss. your data is frequently affected by a data loss. if you want to use your data back to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the new installation of your OS, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash suggests, you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget the aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desasterprevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files which have been changed since last complete security. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete security and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that has been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes to a sioning system next with the exception that is only abgeted and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only changed the difference of files that is really changed. this happens and if you want to increase safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you get enough time to discover and recover losses. at the same time you come for securing them with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for a month and a snapshot should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures the next 40 year survive that is about the time span you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to consider and reassess the time. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain watchfulness. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards. less easier you can rate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backups, or change your file format, you should convert your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planning the scalability with plans and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and move it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, whether your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd / / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBH; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and travel FS & dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it is possible to save as much more. it is possible to save as many administrative requirements for a heterogeneous coding. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format would recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; it is a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a file information provided with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the shell format. but it can be able to edit metadata separately from the image file. therefore, you can think of problems with the image file. therefore, you should think of whether to use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation which supports a large range of application and modeling, discussions and general work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you want to edit the images again with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images of copyright with a digital watermark. then export it into Webgaleries, encode them in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section add a photo to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive. but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect it to the computer, turn off the camera to the display mode, and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera-interface, this can take a while using your camera. when the connection is made, a piggy indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and symbols will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to see camera information about every entry. with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information, which is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras, all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer of slides, GPS etc. of the image. these information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from your camera into a single album in & digiplug;. when downloading the pictures are not deleted and we recommend you to delete the pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde. as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button to download and then download them. the button selected is as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is now available to download. these images have been selected until now. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance. if you select this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons all or download them, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, where normal folders will be sorted, shown in the section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the button Delete all. if you want to delete all of them, you must first select it and delete the delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no way to delete photos that you have deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the photos successfully in one & digiplug; you should carefully check if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete the camera name, this should be much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the file names are usually recovered from the camera, if you can download photos from the camera. hence, it can be useful, the date and time to integrate the picture in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dator-based subdirectories. if you use this latter option, automatically created a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options, before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF data in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-%% d% H:% S. switch on the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the possibility to change the file name in lowercase. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which has been digious; for a photo is used below the name, the camera will be displayed in the preview. your settings will be saved and automatically used if you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the camera's orientation to perform an automatic rotation during loading. not all cameras do this information. in the page section Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera doesn't deliver this information, the photo is in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has information about the date where the photo was made, you can download & digiplug. all pictures with the same date are loaded in the same subalbum. not all the cameras are available in the same subalbum. you can read all the cameras in the same subalbum. in the page section Meta-Data, you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you must select this option and select the option datagave off at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is such a button to download. select File Format dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digiplug is done; you know where the pictures are loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera will be displayed. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. the identification of data can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer, it can be interesting to link a image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to associate an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken, you can view a postcard to another & digiplug; users can send a postcard to another & digiplug; users want to document the spot, or simply to document this aspect, it is good to enrich the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reworking copy of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit. but there are a few who works with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you must save this data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page, you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto.</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exiftool from Phil Harvey. it uses the predatory properties that are created for maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="284">Select action can be set on subdued preview or Image Processing. thus, you specify the default behavior of & digiplug; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacy and copyright data. these data will be automatically written to the IPTC data base when downloading. synchronisation is also stored in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the author line: this field should be the job title of photographer, freelance photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description to the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author if it is a picture agency such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency has to be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions saved the data into the corresponding IPTC field. this will enable the metadata only in the image and is not only available in the database and can not only be found in the database and can be imported into & digiplug; they can be imported without lost.</seg>

<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats; to specify which file types & digiplug; to specify, you can add the file extension to this list; AlbumFolders, which has none of these extensions, has not been removed from & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the button right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the beam & digiplug; can be set on this page on the default value. each time, if you can then use the illuminated mode, you can only use different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have a log file, you should only get better results. if you have one, then you can get better results results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can select it here. you can switch the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker and light colour in the image. these colors can be switched on and off here in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the next explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. the only effect is reducing the image quality as PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to high compression. 1: low and 9 a high compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files, you can compress the deflate compression sample for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality as the deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss. even if you have written the loss of loss and file size much better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata is not yet supported, but was found in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it was developed very quickly to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are the same as the CCD sensor in sensitive to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this difference with a minimal loss of details. this option is a bit soft, eliminates the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 bumps with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used for the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance on a white card shot in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the effect that exposed pictures will get more detail in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "" "" "the standard is the top to capture the parts of your camera to capture the top of your camera as pertinting." "" "setting colors creates a few unusual results since it shows the shrouters in various rokes. at last, you can try to rebuild a few parts of the missing information from the shredders." ""</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & fixw, therefore, try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be customized for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value according to your taste. but you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; image processing has been made. in order to keep the time for humosaicing, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">"" "" "" "a digital image process is a digital image process to draw a complete picture from the subcutted image sensor, which have many cameras and which is a matrix of colorless pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour design." ""</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw are available for you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. but it produces Farbartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lentils you can place the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color sofar correction, as you are performed during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions such as these are given back. there are also LCMS and digiplug; information like the colour information from a colour space to the other are the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Put the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digiplug; investigated this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures colour is not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit to the camera man and model that you are using. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some examples such as Canon, who do not have color mapping or gammacorcture. currently, dcraw gamma does not corrects conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer might be given back. this is very useful, as your printer may have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated, instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that colour profile is provided for them. unfortunately, this is not a table of cameras and profiles together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the finish: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing has been supported; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. you will then select a list of available modules, and these modules are then downloaded from & digiplug. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also see some in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other checkboxes switch the metadata into or out, which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties are shown on the left side of a list of all-time cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is properly connected. here are the port settings. currently, here are serial port, USB- and USB / FireWire mass memory.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can put the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / h, specify when you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you have to connect the camera to your computer, put it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Test out if & digiplug; the camera automatically realizes. if not, you can set camera amoodell and port manually. after your camera is set up, your camera will be camera in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. if you have more than one camera in the menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the acknowledgement dialog for the shifts of &gt; images in the garbage dump you can set the talk of & digiplug; in deletion of a photos in an album. in the deletion of a photos and deleting of a album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used silently by & digiplug; if you use the changes in the right side bar without requeries. otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digiplug; in order to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can select from toolbars under settings. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug, you can find more information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to preview your photos and to fix them. the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the view and selection of the entry / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you can set up in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current filename, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, among them the toolbar for fast access to the most commonly needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, the original photo will change before you save file Save or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can use the original image by restoring the image processing in the toolbar. then you lose any change in which you have carried out on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo, by clicking edit reshape or restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should get the shortcut shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reshape and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; on the toolbar or restore button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the video editing, you can choose between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu. if you want any changes to the current photo, you are asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the picture and out zooming in which you Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or use the entries in the Ansicum menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the tool bar. if you do not want this, you can change it in the settings dialog of & digiplug; you can call it from the digiplug; main window. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, please click the image below and receive the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sentences. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and from the menu album exporting printer assistent. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which is important information and promotions for the selected images. the same page bar is available, without the navigation feather, even in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple times click on the same rider to appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert it. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels will be copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII-characters and are limited to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use the button to use or change simply to the next picture, the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but you can also read the metadata into the files. this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the page bar or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate more pictures at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the pattern in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selective box with the previously specified in this & digiplug; session lit.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword will be dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly retrench the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in a tree by marking the appropriate checkboxes. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and choose a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the whole selection, if you want to make a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar _ password filter is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window. if additionally, the left side bar is used with their album, - file, keywords and search results, only the cut-quantity of these two files is displayed. all created files are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop them. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply go out of the right side bar and place it. then a dialogue that you asks if you want to place the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords. they were drawn with Ctrl + a. and after that, a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and discarded there. a dialogue asks if this keyword is supposed to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and determine that it should be a or not, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the rules range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keywords, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an extensive search of all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, only check the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options see then as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mainly adapted to & digiplug; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one can use a colorable workflow, which allows you to easily photograph the colors of your camera or scanner. with a colorable workflow, you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner. you can print or publish the colors that you print from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons must oppress for the results which he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with plenty of background information about colour management. additionally, you should make your own information about your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are filled with six below criteria, then you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works as well and makes life for everyone so easy, then why one should use another color space so that you need to make thought about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see is the hufeisenformed region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor when I decided to work in the RGB color space only?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to kalligert your monitor. if you are working as in the colour space of sRGB, you must use your monitor on sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. so use it before attempting to undergo further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, deviating, automatic, and contrast extend from the menu Corrigating Automatic fix automatically try to make the best of your colors the best. they will be experimenting with these effects to see which seems best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the parameters over the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often a magician correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abby: this method adjusts the brightness of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity of the intensity is as flat as possible. it is a very powerful operation, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which caused either wonders in a picture or destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic off: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue channel. they determine the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast expand: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the limits of the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new jiffy of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white comparison of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white equivalent of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The whiteboard flat correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space being removed with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original image, you can perform the whiteboard in the rough mode, so your possibilities for correction can be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equiscated shape of the copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it on the menu entry colors white equalization of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image and preview of the target can be seen. if you want to see the original whitens again, it will be enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the Target photos has a red marker. this marker's luminance is shown as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right top is a histogram that is altered as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminanzets. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow of Justification is letting you enhance or down your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are playable, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white comparison. this type also automatically set the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the whiteboard with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overloaded indicator increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white equator. this is shown in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and store are exactly what you set. every setting of the white comparison you can save to a text file and then reload them later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"" "the" "" "button" "" "button settings will return all filter values to their standard values and their neutral white background. note that neutral settings will be shown as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code input per color channel of the modified picture. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding needs more recording space, accounting time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for use of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same mistake and always need the same correction. in the manual to the audio correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects makes you four color effects, a bicycle effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a cantonal filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, it was called tization, also called Sabatizer, a effect of which was developed during a partial pressure of a short flash light. this was the effect that the lighter areas coated with the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase is finally generated, that so not to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is (1) and this is processed (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation effect that makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a striking colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias is strongly saturated color paints but also some photographs, especially those are hardly any landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repeats the strength of the neon. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be seen in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the inverse problem rather than increase your saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase the saturation instead. if you like the result you can be able to preview the results using Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchthickness / contrast / Gamma the tool is based on the coating of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool has been very complicated, you need to explain the range of sliding for the range of sliding. concrete the three firves below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity, an histogram, of active channel or of the selected area. under the graphs, three slide tables can be clicked into the inside and to change the intensity of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is to move the knob and take care of it as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this drop box, if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic scale is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest tones for the middle tones, frequently Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs of the shade, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used for example. the compression of the output can be used, for example, to create an outlight picture as background while doing something else in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the specified values in the file system are stored and later loaded again. the Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three colour pipette will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, resources and sunny tones. enable the color pipette to reuse and click on the preview of the original program for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indikator controls all the colour channels to show overexposed pixels, and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the entries applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures with large areas of a constant colour, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps further.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curventeil to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can notice that these bright tones will correspond to darker beds and that the corresponding picture pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to look. if you want to change this marker on the bend, the original value is displayed. create a point on this line and move it up and down, until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve that you have created can be saved and later loaded in the file system. the file format is the Gimp format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunny tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure indekator controls all the color channels to display over-coated pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and suntones has been applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel display box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint like you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as comparison of the own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. when you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Checks for the module are right down: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to add these channels. if you want to keep Luminance, this is especially convenient when you can also check the Monochrome option, because the channel Mixer gives you the creation of great black and white conversion of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, causes the reduction of a colour to a visible noise, which looks different from the same place in the colour channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can save and then load them. the used file format is the Gimp-hand-blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indikator controls all the colour channels to show overexposed pixels, and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you can see the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. option Luminance is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of movie profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure using a green linkfilter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white movie exposure using an orange line filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangery.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white movie exposure using a red line filter. this creates dramatic celestates and can simulate lunar ammats for the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotator.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with an yellow link filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the shadow tube. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and recovery in a sepia schooner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a painting.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, the bull of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensional texture of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The & digiplug; tool frame is able to add a decorative frame to be added.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not easy task. to keep the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streamed eye. under image frame, the module can be started using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the image type for your picture. thoroughly relocates the picture with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), matching with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal is ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image is bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert a simple text into a picture of any location. this is also possible in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your properties like you need. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button" "" "OK" "". "after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; tool templates, you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image stencil apply in image processing can be used to put templates through a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. if you want to add to the size of the file size. if you want to add your stencil template. if you want to add your stencil template, please send us an e-mail in English to the digiplug; mailinglist digicame users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to select your template folder with button Base Folder. select the folder where you have to copy the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for stencils it appears a tree view that is reflected in the folder structure of the stencil printer. the selection of folders will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button shrinks the lower picture. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, you must cut the picture accordingly. check the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move under the template below. take the picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted to the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; three different tools available for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces very dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unacuity mask works on the contrast of the edges to look sharply. actually, it does not use a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it as a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of the sharpness. elements are smaller than the resolution. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private user-user.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG pictures, a camera has been used for internal sharpening. images in the shell format must always be hashed in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner address a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening march. you can disagree with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But it should be careful, as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you can focus on the menu entry screen. in general, you can focus on the menu entry screen. below, you can find further information and comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft, is much easier than it to use. use the tool to soften with the menu entry screen and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog gives you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter invisible mascot is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filtering with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first try out. a increase in the radius or the amount should be tried first. if you produce the sharpness mask, noise and get the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses as many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpest pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the illustrated image that is added to the original. thus, the thickness of the edge is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. this way, you can define a minimum difference to the edge of the filter. this way areas can be used with a soft change between the sounds from sharpening, and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mascot filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp mascting was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus refocuses on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected draft-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to use a picture & quot; refocussed quot; in which it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. you can usually start better results than unsharp mascting. you can start it out of the menu by calling colours refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular version works much better than the Gauß's foot. the Gauß's Foot has a very long tail, which is far from the source-pixling, which is far from the original quellah. the FIR Wiener Inverse is influenced by far from the distant pixels. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value of 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp, but then on Heiligence.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values can be reduced from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 but are very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is 0,03. a high value is even further polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. this is the most common one for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you have a value unequal zero, you might also need to increase correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation materials. however, if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. note that the module is very slow for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to execute all the labels, color and intensity cartridges on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible, but later uncomfortable artefacts left.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, intruded masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused, the unchy mascate has used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce an infinity mascot. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filters it can never show the effect of the FIR Viennese Filters. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color picture has to be corrected. this image has been taken with a analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of the sharpenance correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smooths put down the sharpness of the range darkened to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">Color content allows a customized color for the pupils. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tool designed to remove any desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as a starting point to simplify the restoration. available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider's blades and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothness via the image. a value of 0.09 should be used mainly due to larger values. a value of 0.9 should not be so tolerated. please note that it should always be subjected to the accuracy of correctness.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction of correctness alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly into any direction, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD hiss will produce a high level of shaft similar samples. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum glass dome factor above alles. p then define the relative smoothing. therefore put this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is subject to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is checked, as it is difficult to value the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually it is sufficient for 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepping distance [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angle should be a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step range [0,1, 10]: integral step distance in pixels. you should avoid the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality that you receive by selecting this option is only minor. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading are exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you draw. thus, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are taken with little artifacts. the module is taken on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with a analogue camera. as you see, there is an unusual black artefacts that caused by a poor movie location during the trip. the original image is visible under (1) and corrected the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses the copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides a selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel are needed and can be harvested through the radius and color in it and thus minor bug fixes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge spacing. this value is rotating the pixel pitch. if it is increased, the adaptive filter image will need to adjust. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer get and rustproof or reproach.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision of the filtering. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter can be removed or predators may occur. put it on a value close to the maximums if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the jure process that controls the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the jure process that controls the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas, which are typically stronger, however, even the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phasendjittery absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. when it is increased, noise and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. it can remove foam tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used just for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how much noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected margin with (2) has been applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes, a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution, drawing a bit soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to shark with the menu entry Corrigts and experimenting with the smooths. the fixture window on the right side of the dialog depicts the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to decrease photo factefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, film grains, scratches, scratches, scratches, scratches and local faults, which is carried out along the image contours and thereby obtains the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colouring and texturing. the algorithm is used with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrei and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compress compresses and quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting is to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and store are exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can have a photo with a picture-shaped rushing. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded on an Ilolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film of film on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures can be viewed on an old paint picture, which have been viewed with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that have been viewed by the scan light and the photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixels from photos that have been made with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, dead or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw materials photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark-image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark picture. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to detect the dark picture directly in connecting to discover new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the correct dark picture to correct picture. a automatic workmanship of the dark picture will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filtering with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average-section: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from the pixel block to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) are used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default movie method. all pixel with a spacing of 2 or less for pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the HotPixels correction on a color photo, taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposes. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digious correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. exposed corners, to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can frequently be lighted up the whole sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they can reduce the corners there. teleobstructive also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lens should also be used, even with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise indefending effects are created through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using large exposure areas of today's film and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter using a equivalent transformation in a pipe image that has been applied without this filter. the tool of Vignetting filter is applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">You can control the Vignetting correction filter and add three further exposure to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Dense: this parameter controls the degree of volume absorption at the point of the largest density of 1, or randomly an optical filter with an aperture level of 1, or randomly a luminance of 1, despricht.Increase the density to compensate a bigger degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options, as you need to raise your settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer repositioning of the target image, let the values for the luminosity / contrast / Gamma with zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction made on a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct picture in the corners and (2) the correct picture. a candy and contradiction has also been performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treat the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but laughs on the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth Grades corrects the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two geometric distortion almost eliminates.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, broad-shaped distortion is corrected and positive values are conscientiously distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value affects more strongly in the edges as in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first graft. negative values increase the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this is the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustration the dialog with a preview correction. the values that you are using for your image are stored and the next startup is used as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The cranial or canned correction should be performed before all zud- or magnitude changes. at best you can cut this correction as all first. if you want to re-cut a picture and perform a broad-shaped correction, the effect would be the impact of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best fix to help you show this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, like e.g. the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the horts / cylindrical distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cylindrical distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the broad-shaped correction made. the next logical step for some motifs like recordings from front, frame and painting is to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. please note that when you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the broad-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gannguru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. when you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters of film grains and photosensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the quantity of color grains and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filth effect applied to a landscaped photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the points.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the film.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to view this special, gallery-like, road photograph, especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of intensity and granularity of grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, in ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film bearing plate on a black / white picture applied. the original picture is the (1) and the processed photosensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper elects the pin-size between one and five. thick brushes are better for large images. smoothness controls the smooths or, viewed from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the reference is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a cabbage in drawing. it is very useful for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to capture it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast (smooths).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further by adapting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in cells, and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using imp effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharper: get the picture along sternal lines going out from a center. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often found in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharfe: blurred the image by rotating pixel. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: the picture wipes the effect of a non-focused camera lenses. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharpness: the image wipes the image through horizontal movements of the pixel. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: a car or a train photo, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft marks: the picture gets into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny colour effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpened sharpness: the picture wipes the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thereby simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart Unsharper: finds the colouring in the image and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this makes it natural your pictures a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the drop. since the droplet size is not taken automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size of the image. amount changes the visual effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can also use the digiplug; image processing has a range free of raindrops. use the choice of tools to choose the area, e.g. a face that is to stay free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regulator. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it through skewers or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformers rotating and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools designed to enlarge a photo on a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you reinvent a picture and get the details sharp? how can you re-invent the missing information here? how can you find the missing information here? how can you see the missing information here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"" "if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformers change in the menu and enter the target values." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation. using a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain the aspect ratio: when enabled, when setting the new size, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is subject to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is checked, as it is difficult to value the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading are used exactly to this. any customization for photo may be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast on what it makes, but it can last very long and take a high CPU load after you draw. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo inflating, by increasing a small paint picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently conducted operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows you to use a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and remove the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">Once you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus, you can change a good overview as your photo will look. you can drag the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. simply create a new rectangle using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button The Add button button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the file data storing or file Save as the file to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbnails, you can change the size of the rectangle by clicking the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">After a aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high format or cross format. in the high format, the greater value of the height and in the section format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is using a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you are centimeters, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection automatically or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after a aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored for the next time, these settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data can be reflected in the original image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of communicating assistance allow us to add to help you to make your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonical particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-party rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a split which is on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the flower sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put up your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the standing part is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle turns liquid support lines when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results to your goal. in comparison to third party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition gives the gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. it should be used to form the golden spiral. it can be a line that can be a line or different objects. this thing can be just as being without the eye, it will satisfy his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle can be derived from the above discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can be made a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create a effect of the professional photographic dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious divides.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can put the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, you can adjust the aid lines. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. you can fix it with the & digiplug; image processing and tool free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation is a horizontal and vertical line available. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-aliasing slips the picture a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are performed at the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transtransformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unhappy filthy holes in the corners. a possibility of distortion it is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture to the opposite direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no turn, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press on preferences, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line finishes. move the mouse to an important point, like e.g. the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now adjust the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shift, the picture gets caught a bit. for a single shift, this effect is usually negligible, but two deposits are generating double so much pumping and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the picture, the picture has unnice dirty holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the image with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compile. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all files available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras can even select the format used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Imaging is the application of data compression techniques on digital images. redundant data will be reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, glattering results as JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless when this is indicated in the settings.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, cracking suppress, refocussing, deleting the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below, see & quot; texture applicable quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this gradual balks shows the status of the filter to the current image. links of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumbnail. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically share without duplicates. the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected pre-looking area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Split horizontally without duplicates. the upper area displays the original and bottom shows the filter to the range below the selected pre-looking area.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & krepviewer; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphic interface with all functions of an integrated & kde; program to replace.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphers. graph graphics with all the possibilities of an integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (such a change in the graph and Kate; the graph is calculated and in & krepviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & Kate; open the graph in & krepviewer; open in one & Kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that requires the & graphic tool; tool & dot; for displaying the graph. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. in this case, the tool bar is open only as in the lower screen picture. in this case, the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list is last open files. click on the first icon to open the file format.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen picture:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner will be shown if graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position in the context menu or select this location automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below, you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just changed in & krepviewer; the uploaded file has changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. you can also change your decision later. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item settings.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph outside of an ongoing & krepviewer; -instance open, eg. in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & krepviewer; or you want to open a new & krepviewer; the instance would like to exhibit a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but this can be changed using the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph should be split up to multiple sites. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple sites, you can choose whether the parts of the graph may be applied on this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the page may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="753">The & Circo; -Algorithm assigns the nodes in a circular pass according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycles of cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">A dialog box opens in which you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should give the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout you can give & eg; the & graphically, or modify the graphs using a filter before being drawn.</seg>

<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. to upload a correlation over time and localization, you must download a file file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that have been recorded in the same time at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded with a automatic correlation which displays the coordinates into red. GPS spurts are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera version must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera capability. the deviation below will be merged. the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file, and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have a suitable data. if you know that in reality, you can set a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put this limits and then press the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set using this dialog. since the dialog you have made a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog you'll need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG lossless module is a tool to change images without impacting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions listed below to store images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is the file size, since no compression of the colour information is taking place. for example, this can be found in the PNG format again.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera system is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the Import feature of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image file dialog with which you want to copy the image file, so the image will copy to which you want to copy the metadata. if you want to copy the data, click the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG-Video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an image file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module, it is possible to use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD to your DVD Player. finally, you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG slides. then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files. there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should be able to adjust the other settings. if you are planning to re-publish the file on a TV, you must set the corresponding TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should set it black. the name and path of the created file can be set under name of the mpeg file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file, if you have an audio file, it will be integrated into the film. depending on your computer you can start the production of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the dip when you return.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right down button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photosizes. the combined image can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, to enhance or print the Gimp module for the direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import / convert your images stored in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dscw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dscw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera producer. sometimes you get a crap better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter Window will then appear in mode for a single picture. with the button Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now duplicate the values to optimise the conversion process. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera does not work in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a funniated algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, maintains all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are preferred to edit your pictures or later to use otherwise, you should not select the JPEG format, as it is only a limited number of operations. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that are stored in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack processor mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. so use this mode if you are sure, for example, by testing on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have here the possibility to automatically overwrite it. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier trial. however, a preview is not available at how far the conversion progress is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a record. you can set the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. in addition, four kinds of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Din.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. aspect ratio will be changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo series. the target image, including background size, border size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. there is also possible to change the size of the images in advance. more pictures can be drawn from the list of images to be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window with the images are displayed in selected images. to add more images, you can add more images to a file selection dialog. for the last image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures onto the picture list and add it to the list of images to be added.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "with the" "" "button images" "" "images are removed from the list of images to be selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the new message window with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached already as Appendix.</seg>

<seg id="890">Delay between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, choose another effect in every transition.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>

<seg id="917">& PhotoAlbum; presents two options available to create HTML websites with your images. the following part of the user manual is integrated in & photoalbum. in the following part of the user manual the text is described in & kphotoalbum; built in the following part of the user manual page, which you can use the HTML file....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overlook and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on the photoalbum; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether you want a & kphotoalbum; -Export File is to be created on the review page. place more information on export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page. for example, you can find that information is displayed by a party. for example, you can't use that photos from a party. you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain views.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. this way, those who have viewing your website and have a monitor, which supports maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures to download, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set. it can thus browse your pictures with low resolution, search for a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture greater, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the various folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best for all your HTML files, select a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and the next time will be added to the location. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you're looking for the Base Folder. if you specify a web browser after the Base File is created, the URL, which you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them manually. this is why you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folders in which all subfolders exist.</seg>
<seg id="930">The installation options have all three on basic folders or URLs. in this, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbums, you may want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures. if you have already checked your pictures, persons on the pictures, capture site, etc., you have to go with & kphotoalbum; this work is not yet to be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & PhotoAlbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others to your database. the properties are ex- und imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images can be stored in the file, or if you can all have a link to the file in the file that you can share all images and keep this file so independently. the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the images in the file the .kim file. if the images are not found in the folder of the .kim file, the images will be displayed if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the following dialog for exporting images, which you can export on the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual to copy the .kim file, you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic option, copy the .kim file copying & photoalbum. download the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small, it is usually not to compress the files. if you want this nevertheless, simply select the Export Export option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum limit. if you would send images to your friends, because the .kim file would be very large, as the .kim file would be very large, for example, to say that each image should be maximum 800 pixel high and broad.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you must select what images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are the category of personable file persones (if you are a Dane) while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories of the imported file and which categories these categories correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can assign the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: if you look at pictures you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, via (2) to search and look through (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been released as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos. at many places in this handbook it is spoken about images, but frequently this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& PhotoAlbum; stores all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want to secure it.</seg>
<seg id="950">& PhotoAlbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are saved and use this at future Starts automatically. if you want to read a different folder with images, you can start & kphotoalbum. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of user manual you will discuss the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, which you can call on the viewing options and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On view the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the dialog options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle-member states.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the customization options available for you to determine the member groups. with the above selection list, you can select the category you want. in the left side of the window, you can see a list with the current category and in the right one of the subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& PhotoAlbum; shares his modulation system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. additional information on this page can be found on the Kipi's homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can't be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photoalbums, but most modules have a help page, which you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with each other, it can be that the modules have been tested with the demo database before using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photoalbums are not working. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbums, and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums. even if & kphotoalbum, this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">I simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so show all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also has to pass a list of albums. here is a photoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & PhotoAlbum; S Browser plays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you would like to use the category for example, if you would have chosen persons to view and add this module to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photoalbums are not compatible. you can also remove these from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select the modules that modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen, once you get & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with any other KDE application, you can see the window. at the toolbar you can see the window, with which you can view your image database. in the section, we will not view images on this window, but now click on the pictures below, which shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbums; is the possibility to see each image with notes, where the image has been taken on the picture, where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of pictures. if you are depicted on all pictures of Jesper and all images taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes, use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, see three lists with a text box by selecting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum. as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the move of the pictures inside the list: if you are depicted for example a family celebration and on all 50 frames the same 5-10 people, you can find out that the used names are postponed to locate the persons faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to view a alphabetically sorted list, click the symbol for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have been selected individually for each image, you may need to edit all the selected images, and click on these images with notes. in this case, click on the above and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be comfortable to mark all these images and add multiple entries to one note with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as a group. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In context menu of the Andes dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new overcategory or Subcategory. in addition, you can also take an entry to a category. attention, this assumes you can sort out your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">"" "" "" "you can move the individual elements of the note dialogs by clicking the edge of the frame, click and move it out. you can also make your own window by clicking it outside the window range." ""</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, please click on the button options..., which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and the look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also complete a frame completely. if you want to view this window later again, use the button options... and here window a / ausing. this procedure you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures show in the browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the current selected images, or all the images you have no filter. here you can see the size of thumbnails by simple to bottom pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be established as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete, or select the Edit button, or select the Edit menu. now the window will be shown you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& PhotoAlbum; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures anywhere you have stored on your hard disk. in the picture, you'll have to download the pictures somewhere else. in the picture, you'll see the view of & kphotoalbum. if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on your hard disk. for example, the pictures are available in pictures 1-9. for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are available, so you can view this pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and want to copy them again. if you want to avoid trouble acting on your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you can also check out the pictures you want to see in the menu. alternatively, you can also view all the images you want to see and select the menu item everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way, you have set out what images will be hidden in the case of the case. if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry screen, making all the pictures you have blocked off. if you want to see the images again, click lock up.</seg>
<seg id="991">"" "it is also possible to specify a password which must unlock the images to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is by no means very secure. you can read or delete all images on the hard disk and to the others, the password as unencrypted text can only be read or delete the password as unencrypted text, with those that are not familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with views of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you have all your pictures with & photoalbums; manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point. for this reason, you can see them at some point. for this reason, you can see them out of the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. obviously, this picture shows you the picture, but additional information you can enter on the image, like e.g. who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top part of the picture you want to see it, so you can also configure what information displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, see, matching entries on this display. if you click Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected people from your browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures in the viewer, you can use the buttons to the top and down the picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the beholder, you can run it as a slide show. as often it can run a new image after a few seconds. as frequently it can press a new image by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus down. then the slide show is broken by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the beholder of & photoalbum. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can get in the picture in and out. using the mouse button, you can easily zoom out into the picture. with the Minus button, you can zoom out into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom, so the image is not drawn drawn, so that every pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoommerations work at videos that are in and out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the context menu from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgot to put in on the picture. in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to view this name. but you'll be able to mark the picture and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while being one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features, while you are looking at. features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in view, see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the icon Rendering The Symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode complies with entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of reigning modes, from a quick preview of up to whole pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The RENDER settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Any Render mode has a name. you can enter any name any name, but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the rounded image. if you want to use only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and specify the image section to the rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination of quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering, this is a very simple colour and light model to create a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a painting with only a ray is rendered, different mistakes can be created. these images often have a moirè pattern or pattern effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this property are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is repeateditary recursively, because every pixel is still divided and adaptive because the record speed depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray runs a ray of pixel. if the difference between each color indicates the given threshold of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the parameter value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r. 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference is divided between the indicated threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels, which can be checked individually and on further subdivision, you can adjust the maximum depth of records.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is reducing the creation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card map, you can set if the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better humidity for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High detail notices for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera is using an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to the projections, but more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you view a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you view the ground, the ground is rendered below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge of the edge, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise data to parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in section window orders will be explained as you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination of standard window order: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "" "" "the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button." ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order. new views can add and delete selected images with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with boxes, you will receive a flashcard view together with the previous view and firmly anchored the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now, you would like to start with no more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can create the ultimate but easy scene, among beginners: a ball on a plain.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you are aware that you can only use a black screen as a result. if you want to use a 3D program, you should note this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all faults installed, you can see the first start of & kpovmodeler; following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols, as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. then mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you produce. in particular, the view from the camera's fourth wire model view (right below) is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, but note that the camera has to change in view control points, with which you can change the camera point of the camera. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired point.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or add the input button, the wireless model views and the object tree are changing immediately with these settings. as a result, they look at the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might need to insert a quader (insertion endent body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a thorough method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane than the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button of user or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level, even though at the moment, only as a limited time. when you rendering the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you're looking at the object tree, you will find that you can click on the icon + above the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to meet some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, select the bottom to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog appears where you can select how the object is being inserted. please select the name in your own viewpoint (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button. see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only displays a matt black material, because you can still enter the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. now there are many ways to preview the pigments. but there are many possibilities now, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you look no color on Quader and ball, just click on the button of users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set right now. if you rendering your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour. you'll need to enter two new attributes. in the colour list, you must select two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more often, but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree each time, choose the colors in the object properties tab:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply execute this step because you have already understood the basic working methods of & kpovmodeler; it can already be understood as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. place the value for the radius: in 1 (do not forget the input button or to press the button. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have shifted the bottom to a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering now gives a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. use the following step to find a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. then click on the pigments, then select insert and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the user button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection produces some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you've already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a reender method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen, the rendering of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel are reflected and the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect. so, the scene pixels are machined for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with whom you see the scene. without a light source you can see the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene is to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously generated with & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to prefix rough surfaces without changing any diffraction on the surface without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour on pixel base, by using an image file as a color map.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts with Amarok and manage Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts are able to execute external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is usually called exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library. you can see this error in the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org and see also the caputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the file again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is that Taglib when reading the Meta-Infos out of this file system. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, please try SQLite. the support for it in & Amarok; is something more mature.</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiodrome; is an audio CD; it is an audio CD; read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiodrome; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many Kodierers (lossless compression) are currently supported (losers are still installed from the Linux distribution). more coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, read the & CD title; read and saved in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per tracks) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format, or other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiodrome; cdparanoia is compiled. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coding are already available, so it is probably not necessary to compile it yourself. if, for example, FLAC is not used, it is not necessary to install its installation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choosing the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can replay these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, you can lose information through data compression depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above all bitrate the differences are less important as both co-quality produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions.</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper Bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a calculator or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hifi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hifi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hifi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR together stereo, compression rate approximately 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug for music of young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided manually or by the program automatically added to the internet as a list of parameters. they can pass / used in the program as a list of parameters. they can be delivered with & kaudiodrome, and the code name and the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodiersoftware there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or help to Kodierern explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (english: day) when MP3s can be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters by & kaudiodrome; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiodrome; parameters which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself to the computer. it is to note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note that the author is meant) I'm not attorney. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; more or less worthless, so it can not be added to the artist nor the music business. all information can be used anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiodrome; it is active to select a check box (sending an address). in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiodrome, it is intended to use geographic on the next round mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servern for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; or alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which read-out program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that it wants to know that cdparanoia is used, searching in the source code.... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed first when this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the cast WAV files, the Kodierer can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening, you can submit predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Codierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the predefined coding. more information on Kodierer are in chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information on its switches can be obtained via the command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). this must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the equipment of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to indicate both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could be a note on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">If you have read the complete manual, everything is understood but somehow not to do something? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will set up the program for the first time, and read our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as compiled packages for your Linux distribution. anyway, it's not necessary to compile the source files, what you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write screams on it (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & kaudiodrome, something which is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; which needs to be repeated for each additional & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine how to use the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freeDB program to download the & CD; to download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any read & CD, if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading programme to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, it can also help with the file / etc / fscale and an attempt to insert the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card map of General Settings. here there is no much to do. here, an additional transformation is defined. in our example, everything is shown as loaded as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you are informed if data are missing (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected while reading the & CD; it can be connected to the freeDB server on the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop is simple, becomes a & CD; entries found immediately when you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting folder name / file name or tag entries, they can easily be changed using Conqueror &gt; file name and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, select the select fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB big, you can select this twice if you want to use the database, at least the first select fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is located on the following map series.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeway for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server on the Internet. how does the system know what data will get the CD? read the section about freeDB. place it as shown on the screen picture.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this road, the load between the hosts will be distributed. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, since many firewalls will bove the protocol 8880 standard, there may be more happiness with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit data to the freeDB server. the first check box should be activated.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously read pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; to read out the last piece: check this around & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: when you cross this box, then / must the Path / Folder is stored. this cannot be useful if only place on another drive. if the box is not built on another drive, don't forget to use this folder when you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything so enter as it is on the screen photo. the command is slightly long, under circumstances something has to be seen on the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, the resulting bitrate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of generation tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted, in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously active WAV files: with a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiodrome; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, describes how the process of reading the & CD is described. we'll be able to set up a link to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB is to be set up. the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each additional & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD, which is not yet contained in freeDB will see the screen photos slightly different from the data. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD, instead of taking them out of the Internet. comments will be shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example is to be found. it's a 'special' issue of author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; identified as audio CD; it could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then find questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully collected from the freeDB, all titles of the tracks are already filled and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case, that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; specifies a window, and you can select the database entry, which fits best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually redeem it by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, you need access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen picture, enter the title of the piece in the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Current Title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of inidially per unit, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful demand of data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not...), but also to check whether there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the comment, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have an unlimited number of field settings. this option is located on the KodierenSettings tab. take a look at the tab card settings.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the produced files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it, you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodierers or file formats. see in the help to get more information to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry, obviously, with the style of the exit CD; this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data. simply enter the entries for the first piece. enter the title of the table in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typed all the titles of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list box.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign in front of each line of one piece. only the titles which are marked so labeled. make sure that all pieces are selected, or be sure to select the button All pieces on the lower edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "when clicking on the button" "" "select" "" "select the read process, this window appears to be confirmed. click OK and then we will see a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on." ""</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the ending of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece from, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>

<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first collection manager. find this in the menu collection under the point organizing.... click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the immersion in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song in the collection manager. again, you can select the file dialog with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when used (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic adding to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to select the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click to remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu image sequence, the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or delete songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list on the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the Next song next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip a song back, select the button predefined piece, the entry predefined piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the Collective collection there, and click on the button deletion.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid; it is not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map which converts all events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to trump and thus always be a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including AWE and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must edit the corresponding file (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. prerequisite for this, however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "An additional Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to indicate that one section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can be in future versions of & kmid; support can provide devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is shown. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave the order for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional xKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M (GM Patch 127), you can capture a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, you can use the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if you want to play a MIDI file a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch meant that each tone is a different percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. thus, you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds on the perkussions channel. look at the enclosed Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to exchange some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and second channel, you simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain canal (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, set up following the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will be defined further forward in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this canal. in this case always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the Perkussions patch on the Perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is given in which ratio of Pitch-Bender event will be multiplied with the value n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to have no decimal notation in the map file).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggested that GM is to play a sound higher with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to play some keyboards up to an octave higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to an octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of Klaviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this manual you can see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to indicate the played tones. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed where a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a song. if you find it for example, a song is too fast to change the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; which has been compiled because & kmid; without AWE support you have to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & Konqueror; select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable you to add automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can push the arrow keys left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to double the default tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & kde; -Desktop a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, just change into the & Konqueror; window and drag the file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only, without adding it to a collection, turn off the Automatic Add-Collection and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. only you want to play the first file. so you set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join, also include B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me to program further on & kmid; program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred links under the menu option, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category Durable playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchiestage. if you buy an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>

<seg id="1713">After modifying XML files, you have to be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 'option on' 1 '. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starting does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate it by opening another source. however, this would be a second time at the end of the animation. the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this renditions in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swampdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the playfield Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">With that the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages can be used, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash can be specified in the setup dialog file of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; is to search in a consoles and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a pre-given backend for a particular mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual alterations of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play cards from TV cards either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be used, you need to be used to use the device and TV channels. it can be edited manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorders) settings in the kmplayer is able to use dialog in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should be detected by selecting a encoding (for example, it's PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer only XVideo can also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one function). this is why the videoforlinux extension has to be working for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server needs to be included in the configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, by KMPlayer, the sources are used for different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this feature is the dvdnavsource, dvdsource, tvsource, source source, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are enabled, they begin playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both specific attributes for tags and the content of the Featuresdialoges; the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML, and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information regarding the work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries is displayed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but none else.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be submitted a text in the detailed settings and in execution of action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action we can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to use the document or as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantilus; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir message in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document it is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantidus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantidus; by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the listed methods, a script files can take from & quantum aplus; at the default input, input can be determined in the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the implemented application can also be edited. there are two types of issue: normal edition, to the default output; error messages, to be specified on the default output written by default, by the value of the selection box edition is:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in this case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add them the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes has, and you plan to use it, enable "edit" tag, "if available, thus a input at using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignorance! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in their distro).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start knob as a symbol. by using green (green is usually chosen to be interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user can be signaled, clicking this symbol is to insert it; -tag in the current document will be added.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must still be connected with action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there's what else is, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantidus; functions to toolbars or it should be shared for a better overview of some Trenner in several groups. open the tool bar dialog for toolbars. make sure that the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element it should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the tool bar to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a quick way to preview the Conqueror. I'll select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner does not support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; knob the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by Probate all symbols to ensure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be applied to the correct folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder, so that your tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantilus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. this is why I describes one & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & quaplus; repository check if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to let the docrc file. we'll need to handle the second part we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path 1, func1, type 2, tag2, day 2, tag2, day 2, day 3 funcitional 1 = funciton 1 = func.html tag1 = tag.html day 2 = tag.html day 2 = tag3.html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in document tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2: order PHP 4.2, PHP Reference = Basic syntax, # Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known frontier for horrenditions (except by reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to one file (and consistent at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch out & lt; mark. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantilus; Resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed for the context of context sensitive help. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and easily back to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc) in the same folder like docrc and copying your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure to be shared, you will send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to use the & quantilus; -Repository for the use by the & quantilus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to be involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantidus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is a menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbars and folders in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quaplus; -users can download them and use only if our team needs them as correct and used for publication. to make a usefull contribution, why it guarantees a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is assured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading can be asked for their private GPG keys (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case you have several keys you can select one. in the dialogue New resource you have to stay empty (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the load can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload set by the DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, toolbars and files in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, examines & quantidus; in case of problems it warns, and it may be canceled. please note the warning message and the resource is given correctly, a message appears with the specifying of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantitative, but it can be time consuming, because hundreds of day files can be necessary in everyday XML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD package into a DTD package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target identification: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Defining line: the string that in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantidus; according to the conversion & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantilus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to understand these fundamental concepts, this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantiquus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative, the field is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantidus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantidus; uses, available. by toolbars over actions everything is stored, in common folder structure of & quantilus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and samples in a global tree, which will be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personal.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within one particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to tool bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a certain project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emogliding.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantilus; -MDI; consists of some basic areas: the editing window, the device driver with information and tool bar. please beat in, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box leader with the right mouse button, to reload a context menu with the current document matching entries, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorarea leads to a further context menu regarding the processed document, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the word under the mouse pointer, or open the file, if the string signifies a file below the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor is the tool bar of the editor. currently, & quantilus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantidus; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; insert the icon that the tag represents. now, you can insert the data for this just one day. if you want to add a tag (such as anchor), you can fill up multiple fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Projections (QIT;) allow it to be quantiated in the information on & quantidus; to navigate, to open and roam. in the presentation with antenchangers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripting, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool designed & quantidus; it displays all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantidus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more on templates can be found in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you find information on the available scripting languages. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to run, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by clicking on an element it opens a list of commands to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, some attributes and namespaces can change. it allows to change the content of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development. there can be pre-packaged documentation for & quantidus; it can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited projects.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantum aplus; two cartridges at the bottom of the window, via the useful information can be reached: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about each in a quantum running script. for example, the actual DTD used for the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantilus; scripts that are executed are all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantium; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate sauce of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own orders as symbols in & quantilus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantidus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantidus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar Archive via & Kmail; if they can get a toolbar in an email, they can secure it in & quantidus; like any others secure and charge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to customize the location of the & quaplus; autoconf has a number of options to get handed over to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantidus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. you should also ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantilus; is a web development tool for the KDE-surface. & quantilus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers have started to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quaplus; an independent, extendable markup languages editor would be? well, this would be the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer rely on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantilus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be quantidus; it should be suitable & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantilus; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the whole & kde; it follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why does someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; it allows users and developers, & quantiaplus; to extend how to need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantidus; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can also increase productivity. by self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars; extend it without any scripting syntax syntax.

<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project prefix _ file, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, special characters included in the clipboard, so that they appear correctly and not understood by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard in & URL; which is the correct way to add special signs and spaces in & URL; it is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn off the block selection. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; key to choose.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. that's very helpful if you & PHP; -script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that is the window where you see the display of scripting and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantidus; main sequence star. the problem reporter is activated when you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol turn left from the main window. this column allows you to put bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu under the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantilus; projects are stored in the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. it allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder, or to add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more / output modules (Cio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes as & quantum-lus; the project manages. in chapter & quantitative, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool bar. allows you to select the toolbar type: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this will only create the name. actions must be saved via toolbars and they will be asked using toolbars and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantilus; - Team, that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>

<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is downloaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tag, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or disabled the smart insert of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantidus is denied by toolbars if this day does not contradict the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the menu item. click on it. click on a activated plug-in activates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax index mode for the current file. the list of available approaches depends on derkate; version.</seg>

<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. through some limitations in the KDE libraries, the changeover sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu has an entry for every open subwindow. by selecting a contract the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantum drop; main plug-in or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog will affect any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behaviour of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars or add them, and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantidus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every Open Source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the quantidus; development in financial form will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project, as for example, after filling the project name, all directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift; F7 Project Properties Tab.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when typing name, file will be completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantilus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces marked with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine where you want to access, one, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.Un.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote host, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be adjusted rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be adjusted rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you need to download and change static webinar you want to download and change. by serverpage scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of using.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook, or by removing the bunches, clamps from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu pane in the subwindow profiles or with the keynote shift Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard possible), which are re-read in project-related operations like about project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">With this, the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. in search, the debugging can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload profiles (see in) can also be adjusted, as well as an advertisement of a tree view to the contents of the server for any profile, drawing a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, you can turn off event actions and add these actions, change or delete these actions if a previously determined event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitative easaplus opens; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behaviour at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantidus; it is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quaplus; changed files. the same happens when you invite a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management offers free access to the files in the project. there you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but are missing the entries opening and open with... in the right click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only more profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "" "" "the password will be kept in the core and forget at Programmes. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the more unsecure password on the disk -option does not come into question." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantidus; many highland profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name to copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for loading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed cio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator manages a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave it is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be read easily, but everyone can see with programming language.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool bars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple dips of view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the relevant open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantidus; with which one has most to do. it helps not only increase productivity, but also allows adjusting & quantidus; to their own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are tool bars in & quantilus; best about the toolbars on the toolbar. use and add-in. adding tool bar is treated below in the section add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set on either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which the toolbar can be configured, toolbars, toolbars and toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and the action work, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the promotions on them can set up and set up actions in the menu with settings toolbars... and set up actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in key documenting, code cutlets and files to link. & quantilus; uses templates in principle like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. templates have in & quaplus. templates have in & quaplus; in about the limitations you select for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantidus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set exactly before using any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not a pure text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary form. binary templates are normally inserted in documents by means of links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the pre-storage room under global templates. further information about templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text-document type. based on this templates, new documents can be created. it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in the pre-store space under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are to be found in the pre-store space under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a file structure. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as template As you save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the project tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template where you can save selection as local / project templates. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and put on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a file folder. it can be used to copy all file management functions, such as pulling and paste or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right or the project files to create a folder and secure a name for the template. by default, it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projections enable a very target-oriented suburb. you can add-lines and footer lines or dynamically with & PHP; design, paste files or link with them. additionally, you can keep some things in using projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in the $KDEDIR / share / apps / share / maila / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders represents one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder with the right button of the mouse, click the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled, as soon as terrestrial attributes are avowed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default, and fits all except the regular folder in the system overview. if a regular folder would be set, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or rewritten text for templates in this folder. this could be general header and footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip copy of the files into a folder with special header lines / leg lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use the context menu (to indicate the right mouse button) for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantilus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; the first mode is replacing the code editor by the VPL; -Editor and the second, the code window will divide into two parts: the code text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it gives a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and be visible in the source code as required in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL, editor at a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; it is necessary to edit this code. there are no plans to modify this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; -editor synchronously, this mode is already active, puts the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings after a click or automatically select the option. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted: a small jug for quick computers and a big span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to edit the documentation of invisible tags in working with the VPL; -Editor is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this allows to change the manual code. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by clicking the two buttons below. a click into the list allows key words in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents of the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change on the list. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is possible like in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is behaved like usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing or by pressing bar or remodeling.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Insertion tags will be made in the same way through the tool bar, such as the source text editor, such as an anchor day not removed, e.g. if an anchor day is inserted, surrounded with text, any other circumference tag needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars like the tables wizard or the lists Wizard are disabled. they are later used in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of styles. in contrast to other programs for stilts, the search for specific elements is possible and the style of stylistic template can be prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphics tools for comparison. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributing many changes made. another programmer had changed much text at the same time. a further programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within the lines. and there was no clues on the places where perhaps only the insertion had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you wish to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders. this function turned and kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge operation is also fully supported. this is useful when two persons are independent from each other to one piece Kode work and make changes. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen photo shows three source files when assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Sdiff3; also helps you with the same and run complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Sdiff3; displays the exact differences and are similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines are shown only in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance at the summary in column on the left side. (no trouble if somebody changes the deposit.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the others differ in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color indicates that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can facilitate the tippwork by using only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Condiff3 Ordinary Folder 2 - Folder subfolder: diff3 folder subfolder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows to manually enter the file name, select the selection via the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down file. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences are done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge folder will be introduced. if a file is selected, for B and C, use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge operation is enabled, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before beginning with the same / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialogue, you don't need to select the dialog using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and insert them: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes it contains one file, e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much these functions are, it would be only two corresponding files. you would then need to copy two corresponding files, and then compare it. now you can easily copy, paste, and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: there is currently nothing out of & diffuse. only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and lay text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every way to a file is to rest. (note that Windows C is optional. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source records are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (this preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the default color is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarization column. if differences were found, the colour is shown. in some programming languages, the colour is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only in strings and comments, for the Preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the merge column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the line file has no lines. when the line of line is checked, the line is punctured on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison table) also has an information line with the inscription:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you already have the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts has been resolved is saving disabled!!! (use buttons to next remaining / unresolved conflict around the still remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is to be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking a click with the left mouse button in a window the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a jump to the current group.) This group will then emphasise the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic editing or by manual editing no more line remains in the group; then there is only a placeholder for the case. this text is not only a different source. this text is neither displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conforms; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go cautious with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options, ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the images and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard, but you can use the arrow keys left, right, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. if you can also use it from other programs, you can also click navigating to navigate directly to the navigation bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insertion button, you can switch between insertion and writable mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarized columns synchronizes the view of all windows onto the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section) and explained the editable output window.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip forward to the current / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-up) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all unsolved conflicts can also be regarded as conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is checked, you will automatically copy the clipboard. by using this option, however, be careful, because you could easily overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Cedar will be stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-up sign of\, and Win32-based systems are not able to use Wagenrollers + cannenfeeder\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not reuse the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (Settings menu setting &gt; KDiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in its pure form, but would be scanned. on these systems, the button preferences automatically displays an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tabulator button. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or return Return, the line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically to the clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly common selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files is trying & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines are to be found in the source files. only during this first step, white characters may be ignored. the second step is not ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. too, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a line boot sign '\' at the end of one line, but then files can only be displayed with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, although they are different. when this option has to be disabled. during the merge, this option has to be disabled. in default, this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. however, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Default is disabled by default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for smaller differences. the option is activated in preference. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result will be shown before the next unresolved conflict is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter to scan folders and conduct a merge. look for details at documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version will be appix. if already such a backup file is installed with the suffix .original file, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and restart the current running program. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is adjusted globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry. if you use this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection fields for encoding is a brief indication of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special characters can be treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what coding needs to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define imagination, you may not work with your Codec. (for example, your files may not work with your codec. (for example, your files can only handle 16-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn it off to oppress release of changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal yet another overlay column with the information required.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">"" "arrange the comparison window by side or overlap. this can also be useful to display long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)" ""</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and decide to merge the files into the merge menu, even if you only use two files. a simple click is to start merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, the name of the recently used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be delivered to this external command first. in & Kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example to cut out interference or to correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given to this external command to command this command. if the command of the command is specified, the output command is only used when typing it. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your own preprocessor. every input line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when creating the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this process command to convert cline to file size: SED's /\\ '\\' s /\\ '\'\ 's. *\\' is an ergistic expression of the text displayed on each string. the\\ U refers to the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add text files (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $Keyword (\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you might like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line absed. sed "s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hits, and every hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple requirements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something else like perl. perl -e -e -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' allerdings are different from perl. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the preset '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal Preprocessor are retained for the display and to merge operation. further operations do only change the data that the Zeilenabus-Algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal processor, the line-off processor will see the output of normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you cannot accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare it with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a proposal to merge for each object; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulate and display the simulated changes without having it really done,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merge of single files. you only need to specify folder on command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target file is specified, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start together, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folders is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder of the file found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object using a simple mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the property or select the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All subdirectories. open all subdirectories with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the name Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not be chosen automatically. if the merge operation is restarted, you will be informed about any problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above image, the colors A / B / C are used in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Identical entries, however, the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>

<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder, too. there are some options that could be skipped in the folder's folder. check these options to avoid undearable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries together: select the directory and proceed in the directory menu or press F7 (the key symbol). to execute only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>

<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a divider. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be specified using a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file system files, files are a attribute. in other filesystem, you can select one file as hidden. this option allows you to specify if these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links to folders: when the option is switched off, the links are checked out as normal folders. (note that & kdiff3; if the option is switched on), the links will be checked and recursively. (note that this option would lead to an end loop and drop & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistic columns. (the number of unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files which contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare large folders through a slow network, you may compare it faster, only the changeset and the file size. please use caution when using caution. please note that this option is off default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidential date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when when copying the changesdate has been lost. please use caution when copying the changesdate. please note: this option is off default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals for merge operation are selected. the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copy of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered uncertain because the other file is not altered as well. you should check it in any case.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and the extension .original If an old backup file is already existing, it will also affect the normal merge of single files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge list remains visible to the merge of single files; you can switch off the shutters with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch off the window / text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, in the directory menu, you can also specify a single file directly from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be done again and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you enter the directory again: list menu: new: read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the aid of Kio-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively small. or.. .that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank line &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then, a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorizations or change date. therefore, turn the permissions or change date from the original. (note that this option is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the purpose is currently as a difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first the built-in difference-viewer. to view the right mouse button above the difference-viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - KDiff3Part. please note that it doesn't work if the original files have changed since generation of patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & Sdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only the comparing of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or comparisons of folders is not supported in the part-part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is Kompare). in addition, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone this way or going to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not compiled the correct prefix to KDE. by default, configure the configure process in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are actually treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not the same. iF.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for each difference in the files where he begins and where it ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort therefore was too big so far. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit greater quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must restart after changes to the folder with the function refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder cannot be copied into the target folder, if the target folder already contains these files, they are missing in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with Labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group. if the lines are already present, they will be removed during clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled by default. understanding differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature view of all virtual working areas. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the workspaces, to change their size, or change it. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running. applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications.</seg>

<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on a application.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the cursor is waiting for a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome, and to which each mouse click pains. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a bit of exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can also consult pain associated with using your computer, if you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid when using the mouse, it is against pain caused by the desire of mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment: the result can drop for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart shifting activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse button. the smart shifts requires a little exercise but you get used to get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must be stored in the end of the mouse, before & kmousetool; one mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is Intelligentes move on, the turnfield shifts (1 / 10 s) is active. here is the time set, the mkmousetool; after signing the mouse button is waiting before the mouse is reset again, if there is no reference to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking by clicking the mouse button. if this function is enabled, a slow beam to the right and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ stream / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; go to sound & multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider General. there is a slide sound buffer where you can adjust to a lower value to shorten the antenna site.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it is mkmousetool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; please go to the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values that were set up when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button on the button after the final push of user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first use the presets. in particular, smart shifts should be used first. if you are used to automatically click the automatic mouse, you can later take the smart shifts.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it should be necessary to reduce the antenna site of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not display a link, do not park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse has ruined, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, it is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear if you want to watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just begun a move, means that & kmousetool; the operation does not stop by the release of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can use a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want to make it. but if you don't want to make a mouse on a neutral area of mind, if you don't want to cause any button of mouse click. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the title rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I am trying to work with smart shifts, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Smart shifts is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it again. it is very likely to execute it in the clipboard or to add any other action. but it will probably cause them to prepare problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifts if you just start to use & kmousetool; click on the end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse cursor over the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse button. this way, it will always press a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when smart shifts starts to use the shifts time. later, you can use smart shifts without the audible mouse. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X window; installed. that should be the case for most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and are equipped correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; made the mouse button soon as soon as the cursor is curly distorted. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and for those affected by the Maustaing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is let release. in this way, pulling and laying down with the mouse can be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcentre; enabling the management of the network interfaces, the routines and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcentre; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & Cnetworkconf; -package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcentre; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting kcontrolcentre; Internet & Network Network settings in & kmenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configured it, thus & knetworkconf. the device in all displays and setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the install of & Linux; it will be added and set up network devices later, you will need to load the drivers according to the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when selecting network settings in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module's network settings, this platform is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose the distribution and releasing it's best. by marking the setting non-re-ask, the setting can be permanently hit. when setting the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can only be displayed in the system management mode. before, all options are displayed grey, which means change parameters can only be viewed. by clicking the button management system at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The whole functionality of the module is available in the system management system. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage the network devices. all available network devices are displayed. the tab network interfaces can be carried out in the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Set up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button... in the dialog device can be machined.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button to reach the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic selection, the TCP / IP settings are made from an DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information is required for the system as well. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP server will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual gearbox, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration can be specified. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is checked, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization cannot be desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values specified in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. if the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict, you can determine if the required address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or disabled depending on your needs. on-off-off-off network device, check out the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on. switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specify the IP address of the computer in local subnetwork, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If your computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if computer file http: / / www.einedomain.org, the computer solves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for naming the name resolution part of the rider name resolution enables simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or change. DNS entries can be converted into a list with buttons and up or down in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button Add... from the Group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will add the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the button Add. the entry is then inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the Group calculator to name resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button editing.... It will be shown the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The well-known computer software describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for boats when no DNS servers is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list namespace includes some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will support. this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer, and click Add.... The dialog of New alias will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has several alias names, de button add several times and enter another alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known host from the list and select Edit.... The Find dialog box will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">One of the following tasks can be executed, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings required in the module network settings are not immediately in system. to activate the changes you have to be placed in a & console; the following command needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the newest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough, if & kde is installed and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical surface as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & B does not suffice, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Only experienced users are recommended. however, it is not difficult to compile & Cnetworkconf; the following commands should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf. changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace ongoing knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC will be conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never seen great dissemination. from IPv6 it is expected to focus on the common IPv4 protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that is IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address, if available, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global (internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, hence their application is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the standard route is required for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which operates as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; are stored and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as specified.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconony. another stand can occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be from & kdat. it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; if the band returns and reads the prestressing information of the band. recognise & kdat; the procedure on the band will not be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape is bound. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry into the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol of symbol for the tape, the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>

<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you can use to store data. this procedure must not be formatted before using & kdat. if your band drive must be formatted before using the tape of & kdat. floppy disk drives usually set a formatting of the tape ahead, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formation, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the secure files. it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexFile based on the tape. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workfolder in which the backup should be done. the list of securing files is automatically updated to the right working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only those files are stored on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can separate separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot files are secured, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot files in front of the command of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons & gt; gt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drives (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-relocation version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitting & kdat, before the tape is bound to load the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, locking & kdat; this setting doesn't work on all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched ON, the loosening of the integration of & kdat; automatically use the tape. do not use Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, it tries & kdat. not all drives support variable log sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to share & kdat; in any case, the log-size will tell you.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The tape ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby the hostname of the system is formatted on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives that can manage directly with & GNU; tar tar. even other tar-versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup job. this symbol is only active when a tape is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& Ksystemlog; is a & kde; beholder for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system, for example, users have access to information about problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& Ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified account of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems related to their server. & Ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & Ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions also include and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filtering the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the system tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol of the system is to be opened, and it will not appear with system administrator right. the protocol files are usually not shown under Linux, usually in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or after entered character set. in default, the list of log lines will be displayed. in default, a protocol line will only be displayed if one of the columns contain the string of the filter pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. for example, in the protocol-file system protocol, select the process process only with entries in the protocol. so, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default settings and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of the level note. the colored display of protocol-lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the process, for example, if you want to investigate the output of a certain command such as the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option To activate new lines in the main window, to view all new coming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& Ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open up and manage these entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindow. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in menu to display.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init System is rapidly developing as standard for control of the system start-up in the & Linux system. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is below / sam and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to rebuild a machine on System V Init without any reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you'll need to make sure that the old Init was removed there if there were there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead right in / etc. this folder called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start on an other runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on its part in / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't want to use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can discard a look at the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it through your inward changes. if you have something different, then you can fix it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the right scripts start? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, every entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is so written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. it reads the name, and if the K includes, the script is called by the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, which is only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; run also. furthermore, I could also have a user Runlevel; & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not trivial. just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six round level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevables, or change the position within one level by taking it somewhere else. this happens only if they remove an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved to a new range. to copy them to a new runlevel, you must select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various workareas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift one entry into another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the input button to accept changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before being executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts to new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inward and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately doesn't simplify the configuration for the proprietary integration programs in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a expansion of the programme for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) can be easily accessed without any message if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either using the toolbar symbol or the entry Save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user interface; is an easy application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user groups. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards will only be displayed if you have an extended system settings. only if you can carry out extended system settings, if you are able to make individual settings. other card cards appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management map appears, if shadow passwords or such as / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is only activated and initialized if for at least one-bound filesystem (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quotas group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the limitations in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for any filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups are informed about the group of the chosen users. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field of Primese group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog box features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, check this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select the user or group menu, or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. the editing or delete the selected user or the selected group will be analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO BootManager to add, remove and change the boot time, add the time to the booting of the standard operating system, add, modify, change OSes, change, and more.</seg>
